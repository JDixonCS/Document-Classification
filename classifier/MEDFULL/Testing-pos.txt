age at COVID-19 diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.096, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.15) and parity (OR, 1.703, 95% CI, 1.13-2.57) were identified as significant risk factors of severe diseases. Among women who delivered, 78.5% underwent cesarean section. Preterm birth (38.5%), premature rupture of membranes (7.7%), and miscarriage (4.6%) occurred, but there was no stillbirth or neonatal death. The RT-PCR test of newborns' amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood samples was negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Conclusion: At the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, gestational age and parity of pregnant women were the risk factors of disease severity. Vertical transmission of COVID-19 was not observed, and maternal severity did not significantly affect the neonatal prognosis.

INTRODUCTION
The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) has created a major global health concern. At the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2, the World Health Organization designated pregnant women as a vulnerable group based on preliminary studies, which reported poor obstetric and neonatal outcomes of previous outbreaks of respiratory virus infections, including SARS,1,2 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),3,4 and influenza.5
The anatomical, physiological, and immunological changes that occur during normal pregnancy can have systematic effects, which make pregnant women more likely to develop complications from respiratory tract infections.6,7 However, the available data are insufficient and inconsistent to infer the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women in terms of obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Although critical illness was relatively uncommon in both groups, the maternal and obstetric outcomes appeared to be worse in pregnant women, compared with that in non-pregnant women with COVID-19.8,9 Pregnant women will not only develop a more severe form of COVID-19 but also experience pregnancy-related complications such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, and stillbirth.9-16 However, other studies reported that with COVID-19 pregnant women have less severe consequences than those with other coronavirus infections such as SARS or MERS.17 Furthermore, the severity of COVID-19 in pregnant women is similar to that in non-pregnant women.13,14,18-28
In the Republic of Korea (ROK), a previous nationwide study using claims data suggested that the prevalence of COVID-19 was lower in pregnant women (0.02%) than in nonpregnant women aged 20-44 years (0.14%) from January 2020 to February 2021. The medical insurance systems in the ROK that cover all Korean citizens include the National Health Insurance (97%) and the Medical Aid program (3%), which provide easy access to medical institutions. In the ROK, at the beginning of this pandemic, all pregnant women with COVID-19 were admitted in order to receive intensive and careful management. Data concerning the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women in Korea's differentiated healthcare environment is extremely scarce. This fundamental information is essential to assess the clinical benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women.
This study aimed to describe the maternal, neonatal, and obstetrical outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19; evaluate the possibility of vertical transmission; and investigate the predictors affecting the progression to severe diseases.

METHODS
Study design and population
This multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted in 15 hospitals located in the ROK from January 2020 to December 2021. The study population included women diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy and admitted to the hospital. COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive result on reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab or sputum specimen.
Each patient was classified using an 8-point COVID-19 ordinal scale developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.29 The study population was divided into two groups: those with mild diseases ( 4 points) and those with severe disease ( 5 points).
Primary and secondary outcomes
The primary outcomes of this study were to describe the maternal, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. Maternal outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) admission; oxygen supply including high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; renal replacement therapy; length of hospital stay; and mortality. Obstetric outcomes included preterm delivery and obstetric complications such as miscarriage, stillbirth, and premature rupture of membranes. Neonatal outcomes included vertical transmission, Apgar score, neonatal pneumonia, and death. The secondary outcome was to identify the risk factors associated with severe diseases in pregnant women.
Variables and data collection
The following data were retrieved from each hospital's electronic medical records: maternal age, body mass index (BMI), parity, admission routes, occupation, comorbidities, gestational age at the time of diagnosis, symptoms, oxygen support, gestational complications, obstetric complications, treatment of COVID-19, laboratory findings, co-infection, length of hospital stay, mortality, gestational age at the time of delivery, mode of delivery, result of neonate COVID-19 screening, Apgar score, and neonatal complication and death.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), while categorical variables were expressed as frequency rates and percentages. The KolmogorovSmirnov test was used to determine the normality of continuous variables. The means of continuous variables were compared using independent samples t-test for parametric methods and Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric methods. Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test was used to determine the normality of categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 in pregnant women. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Youden's index maximum principle were used to measure the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and determine the accuracy of the optimal cutoff value of all selected risk factors. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 23.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Korea University Anam Hospital (IRB No. 2020AN0408). The requirement for obtaining informed consent was waived because of the retrospective nature of the study.

RESULTS

Demographic and clinical characteristics of pregnant women
A total of 257 pregnant women with COVID-19 were included in the study. The median age of the study population was 34 (IQR, 31-37) years, and 26 (10.12%) patients were aged  40 years (Table 1). Among 234 pregnant women whose parity was confirmed, 120 (51.3%) had given birth for the first time. The distribution of patients by gestational age was as follows: first trimester, 26.1%; second trimester, 33.1%; and third trimester, 40.9%. More pregnant women developed severe COVID-19 in the third trimester than those in the first or second trimester (Table 1). A total of 29 (11.3%) pregnant women had one or more underlying medical conditions. Nineteen (7.39%) pregnant women developed gestational complications (Table 1).

The most common symptom was cough (53.7%), followed by fever (48.3%), sore throat (37.0%), and sputum (30.7%) (Table 2). The severity of COVID-19 in pregnant women according to oxygen demand is presented in Table 2. The distribution of patients by clinical severity,

determined using the 8-point COVID-19 ordinal scale of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was as follows: 76.7% had mild disease (1 point [0%], 2 points [0%], 3 points [0%], and 4 points [100%]), while 23.3% had severe disease (5 points [75%], 6 points [21.7%], 7 points [3.3%], and 8 points [0%]). Oxygen therapy was not required in 197 (76.7%) pregnant women with COVID-19 (Table 2). On the contrary, 9 (3.5%) patients and 2 (0.78%) patients were admitted in the ICU and required mechanical ventilation, respectively. However, none of the pregnant women with COVID-19 died. With regard to the use of therapeutic agents, pregnant women received remdesivir and regdanvimab (Table 2).
Obstetric outcomes of pregnant women
Among 257 pregnant women with COVID-19, the obstetric outcomes of 65 patients were determined. Of these, 37 (56.9%) and 28 (43.1%) patients showed mild diseases ( 4 points) and severe diseases ( 5 points), respectively. The median gestational age at delivery was 38 (IQR, 36-39) weeks, and 25 (38.5%) patients had preterm birth (Table 3). Fifty-one (78.5%) pregnant women underwent cesarean delivery and especially, all pregnant women with severe COVID-19 underwent cesarean delivery (Table 3). Premature rupture of membranes (8.2%) and miscarriage (4.6%) occurred, but none of the patients experienced stillbirth (Table 3). The frequency of preterm birth ( 37 weeks) was higher in pregnant women with severe COVID-19 than in those with mild COVID-19 (Table 3).
Neonatal outcomes
As 3 pregnant women experienced miscarriage, only 62 neonates were included in this study. Among them, 28 (45.2%) neonates were born of pregnant women with severe illness (Table 4). Vertical transmission of COVID-19 did not occur in all neonates who were delivered from pregnant women with this illness (Table 4). Interestingly, the Apgar score of neonates born of patients with severe COVID-19 was significantly higher than that of neonates born of patients with mild COVID-19 (Table 4). All neonates survived.
Risk factors associated with severe COVID-19
In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the number of gestational age at COVID-19 diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.096, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.15) and parity (OR, 1.703, 95% CI, 1.13-2.57) were significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 (Table 5). Age, BMI, gestational age at the time of infection, parity, comorbidities, and gestational complications were included in the multivariate analysis adjusted for study center.
In addition, the ROC curve of gestational age was used to determine the optimal cutoff value for high-risk patients who are likely to progress to severe illness. The AUC of the ROC curve was 0.768 (95% CI, 0.711-0.826, P < 0.001). According to Youden's index maximum principle, the cutoff value was 21.5 weeks. The sensitivity and specificity of this cut-off value were 0.950 and 0.553, respectively.

DISCUSSION
Our study aimed to describe the maternal, obstetrical, and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19; evaluate the possibility of vertical transmission; and investigate the predictors affecting the progression to severe diseases. Pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 rarely progressed to severe COVID-19 or had poor obstetric outcomes. The possibility of vertical transmission as well as maternal or fetal mortality was not observed

Recent data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency showed 1 (3.27%) died and 73 (3.27%) developed severe COVID-19 among the 2,232 pregnant women with COVID-19 from January 2020 to December 2021.30 The fatality rate of pregnant women with COVID-19 was 0.04%, which was not different from that of non-pregnant women of reproductive age (20-45 years), although the incidence rate of critical illness in pregnant women (3.3%) was nine times higher than that in non-pregnant women at reproductive age (0.4%). Even in three other studies conducted in the ROK, pregnant women with COVID-19 were not at higher risk of developing a severe disease,26,27,31 which was similar to the results of previous studies conducted outside of the ROK.13,14,18-25,28
With regard to the use of therapeutic agents in pregnant women, remdesivir and corticosteroids were administered in 14.8% and 23.7%, respectively, and even those with mild diseases were prescribed these medications. The United States Food and Drug Administration assigned remdesivir and corticosteroids to pregnancy risk category B and C, respectively. Patients with severe cases included in our study were more likely to receive remdesivir or corticosteroids than those with mild cases. According to the COVID-19 treatment guidelines developed by the National Institutes of Health, the therapeutic management of pregnant patients with COVID-19 should be the same as that of nonpregnant patients.32 However, the benefit-risk balances in each single case should be considered when selecting a specific drug for the treatment of COVID-19 in pregnant patients.33
The preterm birth and cesarean section rates in the present study were relatively high (38.5% and 78.5%, respectively) compared with that (20.6-25.0% and 52.3-95.8%, respectively) in a previous systematic review.16 Preterm birth ( 37 weeks) and cesarean section were more frequent in pregnant women with severe disease than in those with mild diseases. The mode of delivery did not lead to the vertical transmission of COVID-19 or did not affect the neonatal outcomes.34-36 The selection of mode of delivery may have been based on the hospital infection control status and medical condition of pregnant women in addition to the previous history of cesarean delivery, failure of labor to progress, breech presentation, and premature rupture of membranes.34,37-39
Our study showed no evidence of vertical transmission in pregnant women with COVID-19. In the recent study, 1.8% of newborns of pregnant women with COVID-19 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-qPCR, and 1% experienced antenatal and intrapartum transmission.40 The study suggested that the severity of maternal COVID-19 seemed to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in neonates.40
In this study, the Apgar score was higher in newborns of mothers with severe illness compared with newborns of mothers with mild illness. However, the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores of most newborns were 7 to 10; hence, no further intervention was provided. Only 6 neonates had a 1-minute Apgar score of 5 or 6, and were equally distributed in the mild and severe groups. Furthermore, the incidence of transient tachypnea of newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, and neonatal pneumonia was not different between the two groups, and none of the neonates died. Based on the results of this study, the disease severity of pregnant women with COVID-19 did not affect the neonatal outcomes.
Our findings demonstrated that pregnant women with COVID-19 with a gestational age of  21.5 weeks and a history of childbirth were more likely to progress to severe COVID-19. In previous studies, the severity of COVID-19 in pregnant women at  20 weeks of gestation or

in the third trimester was higher than that of pregnant women who had not yet reached this gestational age.17,41,42 However, opinions regarding the differences in obstetric or neonatal outcomes according to gestational age remain controversial.43
This study has some limitations. First, although the data were collected from 15 hospitals, only some of the data from the study population were included in the analysis as a small sample size. Therefore, the interpretation of the results is limited, and our findings may have limited generalizability. Second, the severity of pregnant women with COVID-19 was possibly overestimated because the data were collected from a tertiary medical institution. Third, the vaccination status of pregnant women was not investigated in this study. However, COVID-19 vaccination was initiated in the ROK from October 18, 2020. Until December 2021, only 9.8% of pregnant women were vaccinated against COVID-19 in the ROK. Therefore, the maternal outcomes associated with COVID-19 vaccination did not significantly affect the results of this study. Finally, this study was conducted on patients with COVID-19 prior to the outbreak of omicron variant. The subjects included in our study are presumed to be mainly related to the wild type, the alpha variant, and delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Hence, our results were difficult to apply in those infected with omicron variants.
To the best of our knowledge, this multicenter cohort study was the first to investigate the maternal, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 according to disease severity in the ROK. In conclusion, the present study showed that outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of non-pregnant women, but they were at higher risk of progression to severe disease. In pregnant women with COVID-19, the probability of vertical transmission is extremely rare, but attention should be paid to the obstetrical complications according to severity of the patient's clinical condition. Hence, the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women should be clarified by conducting a nationwide prospective cohort study. These fundamental data will contribute to optimized allocation of scarce resources and formulation of rational healthcare policies to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.

ABSTRACT
Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has provided a critical evidence base for public health decisions throughout the pandemic. Sequencing data from clinical cases has helped to understand disease transmission and the spread of novel variants. Genomic wastewater surveillance can offer important, complementary information by providing frequency estimates of all variants circulating in a population without sampling biases. Here we show that genomic SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance can detect fine-scale differences within urban centres, spe­ cifically within the city of Liverpool, UK, during the emergence of Alpha and Delta variants between November 2020 and June 2021. Furthermore, wastewater and clinical sequencing match well in the estimated timing of new variant rises and the first detection of a new variant in a given area may occur in either clinical or wastewater samples. The study's main limitation was sample quality when infection prevalence was low in spring 2021, resulting in a lower resolution of the rise of the Delta variant compared to the rise of the Alpha variant in the previous winter. The correspondence between wastewater and clinical variant frequencies dem­ onstrates the reliability of wastewater surveillance. However, discrepancies in the first detection of the Alpha variant between the two approaches highlight that wastewater monitoring can also capture missing information, possibly resulting from asymptomatic cases or communities less engaged with testing programmes, as found by a simultaneous surge testing effort across the city.

1. Introduction
Genomic surveillance has been a significant feature in the public health response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (Wu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) because of its ability to detect the emergence of and track new variants of concern (VOC) (Robishaw et al., 2021). Important

examples include the B.1.1.7 (Rambaut et al., 2020), B.1.351 (Tegally et al., 2021), P.1 (Faria et al., 2021), B.1617.2 (Cherian et al., 2021) and, most recently, the B.1.1.529 lineage (Qin et al., 2021), named VOC Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, respectively. These VOC have demonstrated one or more attributes out of increased transmissibility, more severe disease, a reduction in antibody neutralisation, reduced

therapeutic response or reduced vaccine effectiveness (Davies et al., 2021; Robishaw et al., 2021). Thus, while vaccination currently pro­ vides substantial protection against all known VOC, continued genomic surveillance is essential to mitigate and contain their threat to public health. It informs the implementation and assessment of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing, lockdowns, and regional, national, and international restrictions) and targeted surge testing. It also serves as an early warning system for the emergence and spread of novel variants (Mishra et al., 2021; Tegally et al., 2021).
Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has primarily been driven by whole genome sequencing of clinical isolates, typically using residual RNA from diagnostic RT-qPCR tests. One million SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced worldwide by April 2021, rising to over seven million by January 2022 on the GISAID database (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017). This has provided unprecedented insight into the joint evolution and epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (Harvey et al., 2021; Ward et al., 2021). Nevertheless, the cost of clinical sequencing to generate these data has been and continues to be substantial (10 - 35 GBP per sample for consumables (Tyson et al., 2020), excluding similar costs for staff, logistics and data infrastructure). It may be unsustainable at the levels required to adequately inform public health authorities as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic and threatens public health for the foreseeable future, even in developed nations.
Wastewater-based surveillance is a complementary, cost-effective approach to clinical sequencing, which has gained significant atten­ tion throughout the COVID-19 pandemic (Hillary et al., 2021; Jahn et al., 2021; Mishra et al., 2021; Peccia et al., 2020; Rios et al., 2021; Smyth et al., 2022). Given that SARS-CoV-2 is shed in faeces by more than 50% of infected people (Foladori et al., 2020), it can be recovered from wastewater, its RNA extracted, and its presence and quantity in a wastewater catchment determined using RT-qPCR (Farkas et al., 2020), with trends generally tracking the rise and fall of corresponding clinical cases (Hillary et al., 2021; Peccia et al., 2020). This can be achieved for entire populations by sampling at the inlet of wastewater treatment plants, or at much finer spatial scales, such as across cities, by sampling within the sewer network.
More recently, the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from waste­ water has opened up the possibility of detecting and tracking circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants (Hillary et al., 2021; Jahn et al., 2021; Peccia et al., 2020; Rios et al., 2021; Smyth et al., 2022). Such an approach is particularly attractive for population-level insights during periods of high prevalence, especially if capacity constraints reduce the proportion of sequenced positive RT-qPCR tests. Furthermore, it can detect asymptomatic cases and is proposed to capture communities under-represented by clinical testing, particularly in urban centres (Green et al., 2021; Polo et al., 2020).
Nevertheless, moving from detecting and quantifying SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater by RT-qPCR to characterisation by genome sequencing is challenging. The low abundance of SARS-CoV-2 means enrichment through RNA concentration methods is necessary, simultaneously enriching PCR inhibitors and contaminating bacterial, viral, and human nucleic acids (Peccia et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewater are also highly degraded and fragmented. In combination, this can result in poor and inconsistent amplification of target amplicons and, thus, patchy genome coverage. Even if amplification and sequencing are successful, data interpretation can be difficult. Wastewater harbours a mixed SARS-CoV-2 population. Therefore, sequences are derived from a pool of fragments, removing much of the phase information between polymorphic sites on the genome used to assign phylogeny and lineage. However, by reference against clinically-derived genomes of known SARS-CoV-2 lineages, wastewater data has the potential to detect and quantify polymorphisms characteristic of defined lineages and VOC in particular (Fontenele et al., 2021; Jahn et al., 2021).
Our study demonstrates the utility of wastewater-based genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 using longitudinal data collected from multiple locations in a single city - Liverpool, UK - between November

2020 and June 2021. During this time, Liverpool was the subject of a pilot study evaluating lateral flow tests for rapid asymptomatic testing (García-Fin~ana et al., 2021). This pilot noted the link between social inequalities and testing uptake, with social deprivation and digital exclusion as significant factors limiting uptake (Green et al., 2021). Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can provide valuable insight into some of the communities or areas of Liverpool that may be less accessible to conventional testing. This period in the UK also saw the emergence and establishment of the Alpha (B.1.1.7) and, subsequently, the Delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variants. We show that wastewater genomic surveillance reliably detected the emergence of both and their subsequent rise across a city. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Sample collection, concentration and RNA extraction
Wastewater grab samples (1 L per sample) were collected from eight locations across Liverpool's sewer network and from the main waste­ water treatment plant (WWTP) at Sandon Docks between the 2nd of November 2020 and the 21st of June 2021, as part of the ongoing Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection programme (EMHP, part of NHS Test & Trace, now the UK Health Security Agency) in En­ gland (Fig. 1, Table S1). In addition, concurrent samples from four WWTPs in the southeast of England were collected as a control group between the 2nd of September 2020 and the 17th of January 2021. Samples were transported and subsequently stored at 4 - 6C until

analysis, minimising RNA degradation. Within 24 h of collection, all samples were centrifuged (10,000 x g, 4C, 10 min) in sterile poly­ propylene tubes to remove suspended solids. The supernatant (50 ml) was transferred to 250 mL polycarbonate PPCO bottles containing 19-20 g of ammonium sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. A4915). After the ammonium sulfate had dissolved, the samples were incubated at 4C for 1 h before further centrifugation (10,000 x g, 4C, 30 min) and super­ natant removal. The pellet was resuspended in 200-500 L of PBS. Concentrates were stored at 4C until nucleic acid extraction. Nucleic acids were extracted from concentrates using NucliSens lysis buffer (BioMerieux, Marcy-lE´toile, France, Cat No. 280134 or 200292), NucliSens extraction reagent kit (BioMerieux, Cat. No. 200293) either manually (Farkas et al., 2021) or using the King-fisher 96 Flex system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer instructions (Kevill et al., 2022), generating RNA extracts of 50 - 100 µL in volume. Extracts were stored at -80C until further processing. Genome copies per litre (gc/l) of wastewater were calculated using One-step RT-qPCR for the SARS-CoV-2 N1, Phi6 and MNV targets using an RNA Ultrasense One-step RT-qPCR system (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA, Cat. No. 11732927), on a Quant Studio Flex 6 (Applied Biosystems Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) as previously described (Kevill et al., 2022). Data were not subsequently normalised by flow rate, chemical composition, etc., since we were interested in the contribution of a variant to the proportion of viral RNA in a sample, not absolute case numbers.
2.2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA amplicon sequencing
Wastewater RNA extracts were purified and sequenced with a standardised EasySeqTM RC-PCR SARS CoV-2 (Nimagen) V1.0 protocol (Jeffries et al., 2021). In short, samples were cleaned with Mag-Bind® TotalPure NGS beads (Omega Bio-Tek) and then reverse transcribed using LunaScript® RT SuperMix Kit (New England Biolabs) and the EasySeqTM RC-PCR SARS CoV-2 (novel coronavirus) Whole Genome Sequencing kit v3.0 (NimaGen). Amplicons were pooled and libraries cleaned with Mag-Bind® Total Pure NGS beads (Omega Bio-Tek) before sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeqTM 6000 platform generating 2×150 bp paired-end reads.
2.3. Bioinformatics analysis
We processed raw reads using the ncov2019-artic-nf v3 pipeline (https://github.com/connor-lab/ncov2019-artic-nf) using default pa­ rameters. Briefly, reads were trimmed using Trim Galore v0.6.5 (www. bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore) and aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (MN908947.3, (Wu et al., 2020)) using the Burrow-Wheeler Aligner (bwa) v0.7.17 (Li and Durbin, 2009). Primer sequences were trimmed using iVar v1.3 and a bed file con­ taining the genome positions of the v3.0 primers that were used to

Water Research 226 (2022) 119306
generate the amplicons. We then identified Single Nucleotide Poly­ morphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (Indels) from BAM files using samtools (v1.13, (Danecek et al., 2021)) and VarScan (v2.4.4, P < 0.05, all other settings default, (Koboldt et al., 2012)) on 100,000 sequencing reads with an alignment score > 10. Next, we filtered the identified SNPs and Indels against signature mutations of known VOC and variants under investigation (VUI), as defined by Public Health England (PHE) at the time of writing (https://github.com/phe-ge nomics/variant_definitions, Table S2, Fig. 2). We used custom scripts to extract summary statistics and sequence quality indicators, such as genome coverage, mapped reads and read depth (Fig. S1, Table S3).
To aid VOC and VUI identification at low frequencies from waste­ water samples, we adopted a recently described amplicon-level cooccurrence approach (Jahn et al., 2021). Briefly, co-occurring mutations were called from BAM files using CoOccurrence adJusted Analysis and Calling (COJAC) (Jahn et al., 2021), facilitating the identification of signature mutations co-occurring on the same sequencing read, that is, a read or paired read coming from the same amplicon, thus one SARS-CoV-2 virion. This greatly improves confidence in variant detec­ tion, especially at low frequencies, since co-occurring mutations are less likely to arise through sequencing error than individual SNPs (Jahn et al., 2021). We extracted co-occurrence signature mutations of the B.1.1.7 (VOC-20DEC-01, Alpha) and B.1.617.2 (VOC-21APR-02, Delta) lineages. Since several signature mutations are shared amongst VOC/­ VUI, not all variants have a unique set of co-occurring mutations. B.1.1.7 has unique pairs of co-occurring mutations on amplicon 146 (genome positions 27972 (Q27*) and 28048 (R52I)) and amplicon 147 (genome positions 28111 (Y73C) and 28280 (D3L)), while B.1.617.2 only has one non-unique pair of mutations on amplicon 121 (genome positions 22917 (L452R) and 22995 (T478K)), i.e., it is shared with other variants.
2.4. Statistical analyses
We used R version 4.1.1 (R Core Team, 2021) for all statistical an­ alyses and ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) for visualisations.
Prior to analysis, all unique signature mutations (SNPs/Indels) of a given variant (Fig. 2) were identified in each sample, mutations with a read depth <10 removed and frequencies of 1.0 and 0 rescaled to 0.99 and 0.01 for beta regression compatibility, respectively. We modelled the relationship of the mean frequency of each variant's signature SNPs/ indels with location (i.e. differing network sites) and time during respective variant emergences with beta linear regression (betareg, "betareg" v.3.1.4, (Cribari-Neto and Zeileis, 2010)), given allele fre­ quencies are in the standard unit interval [0, 1]. To do so, we set the mean frequency of the unique signature SNPs/indels of a given variant as the dependent variable and wastewater site, date, and their interac­ tion as predictor variables. All models were fit by maximum likelihood using the logit link function, logit(p) with p the probability of observing the (variant) data and logit being the inverse of the standard logistic

function, and included site as an additional regressor for the precision parameter when it improved the model fit (see Table S4 for final model structures), as indicated by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and likelihood ratio tests (Cribari-Neto and Zeileis, 2010). To account for missing data in SNP/indel frequencies, a weighting factor was applied using the number of used signature SNPs/indels (weights = n). We assessed model validity by visual checks of homoscedasticity of the standardised weighted residuals and linearity of the model fit (Fig. S2). We then extracted likelihood ratio tests of estimated marginal means for each predictor variable (joint_tests, "emmeans", Table S4).
We also compared the frequency of detected VOC/VUI signature SNPs/indels in wastewater samples to the frequency of VOC/VUI iden­ tified in clinical cases by the COVID-19 Genomics (COG-UK) Consortium between the 2nd of November 2020 and the 21st of June 2021 across Liverpool. We extracted counts of genomically confirmed cases for all circulating lineages from the CLIMB platform (Nicholls et al., 2021) on the 26th of October 2021 and then filtered and grouped them by the outer postcodes covered by the catchment areas of the WWTP and the eight sewer network sites. For the Delta variant, confirmed clinical cases of the B.617.2 lineage and its subvariant AY.4 were combined. Where outer postcodes spanned multiple wastewater catchments, we included clinical cases in counts for all those sites, divided by the number of overlapping wastewater catchments. Additionally, we obtained total daily infection numbers for the upper-tier local authority of Liverpool from UK Government statistics (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk, Fig. S5).
We modelled the frequency change of variants in clinical data over time with beta linear regression in the same way as for wastewater

variant frequencies. To test the time match between a respective vari­ ant's frequency in wastewater and clinical samples, we used Spearman's rank correlation with a series of possible time lag settings to find the time frame shift with the best match for each sampling area.
3. Results
3.1. The rise of Alpha variant
Across all catchments, we observed a significant increase in the mean frequency of Alpha (B.1.1.7) signature SNPs/indels between the 2nd of November 2020 and the 28th of February 2021 (F1 = 13667, P < 0.001, Fig. 3, Table S4). This closely corresponds with the observed rise in Alpha clinical cases across Liverpool for the same period (Fig. 4) and wastewater data from four WWTPs in the southeast of England (F1 = 13829, P < 0.001, Table S4, Fig. S3). For most sites, the rise of the Alpha variant began in mid to late December, with peak frequencies observed in late January and early February (Figs. 3 and 4). As defined by cooccurrence analysis, the earliest wastewater Alpha variant detection preceded clinical detections in five of the nine sites by up to 55 days (Fig. 4). The contrary was observed in the remaining four sites, with clinical samples picking up Alpha up to 26 days earlier (Fig. 4). The best time match between Alpha frequencies in wastewater and clinical samples also depended on catchment. The closest match varied from a 5day lead to a 2-day lag in the wastewater when testing a range of 5-day lag to 5-day lead of wastewater frequencies (Fig. 4, Table S5). However, this does not match the relative pattern of the earliest detection in the two sample types.

Fig. 4. Mean frequency of B.1.1.7 (Alpha) signature SNPs/Indels detected in wastewater and clinical samples in each catchment, 2nd of November 2020 to 26th of June 2021. Points show the mean frequency of unique Alpha-specific mutations for a given wastewater sample (blue) and the frequency of Alpha variant clinical cases from a given date (yellow). Coloured lines show the respective local polynomial regression fit including shaded 95% confidence intervals. Vertical lines indicate the first confirmed clinical case of Alpha variant (yellow) and the first wastewater detection of co-occurring Alpha-specific mutations on amplicon 147 (blue). The strongest correlation between a 5-day lead and 5-day lag of wastewater data respective to clinical data is reported at the bottom of each graph.

We detected local differences in the rise of the Alpha variant between wastewater catchments (date: site interaction, F8 = 32.8, P < 0.001, Table S4). This was most notable in Strand SSO (STS), where we observed a high frequency of Alpha signature SNPs from four samples in early November (Fig. 3), though this signal diminished before further detections in early January. Similarly, we observed Alpha signature SNPs at a low to moderate frequency at Fazakerley High (FZH) as early as mid-November, while they were barely detected until late December in Mersey Road (MRD, Fig. 3). This suggests Alpha spread through parts of the north of the city earlier than through the south (Fig. 1), a finding corroborated by co-occurrence analysis but not clinical data (Fig. 4).
3.2. The decline of Alpha and rise of Delta variant
From the 15th of March to the 26th of June 2021, we observed a significant increase in the frequency of Delta signature SNPs in all wastewater catchments (F1 = 964.1, P < 0.001, Table S3, Fig. 5), with variation in temporal trends across the city (date: site interaction, F8 = 32.4, P < 0.001, Table S4, Fig. 5). This coincides with a rise in clinical cases of the same variant (B.1.617.2 and AY.4, Fig. S4) and Alpha's decline (Figs. 3 and 4). The best time match between Delta frequencies in wastewater and clinical samples again varied by catchment from a 4day lead to a 5-day lag in the wastewater. In all catchments, a significant correlation of frequencies in wastewater and clinical samples was confirmed (Fig. S4, Table S6).

It is noteworthy that the observed transition from Alpha to Delta in wastewater was abrupt (Figs. 4, 5 and S4). From April to early June, infection numbers were low across Liverpool (Fig. S5), and wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations were consequently low (Fig. S6). This is reflected in the observed reduction in mapped reads and genome coverage for this period (Fig. S1). Indeed, the detection of Alpha and Delta signature SNPs was more sporadic during this period (Figs. 4, 5 and S4). Lower SARS-CoV-2 concentrations - and associated lower data quality - probably also contributes to the lower estimates of Alpha fre­ quency in wastewater relative to clinical data from around March 2021.
Co-occurrence analysis was less discriminatory for Delta than Alpha and, thus, a less reliable indicator of its presence in wastewater catch­ ments. We note an apparent co-occurrence signal for Delta, i.e., the detection of L452R and T478K co-occurring on amplicon 121 of our primer panel, as early as November for all wastewater catchments (Fig. S4). This was too early to be Delta, its sub-lineages (e.g., AY.2 and AY.3) or known VUI B.1.629, B.1.630 and B.1.633 (first detected glob­ ally in February and March 2021), which also carry this pair of cooccurring mutations. The detected signal, thus, must reflect other circulating variants carrying these SNPs or false positives due to reliance on co-occurrence in a single amplicon.
4. Discussion
Genomic surveillance of wastewater has already shown great

promise throughout the unfolding SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (Farkas et al., 2020; Polo et al., 2020), including the detection of VOC (Fontenele et al., 2021), in some cases prior to clinical detection (Jahn et al., 2021). Here, we have demonstrated that wastewater monitoring can also reveal fine-scale, local differences in the spread of VOC across urban centres. Spatiotemporal differences in variant frequencies across Liverpool were recoverable throughout the rise of the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) in early winter 2020 and, despite lower quality data, the rise of the Delta variant (B.1.617.2/AY.4) in spring 2021. This clear reflection of the rise of Alpha and Delta variants, respectively, in clinical and wastewater genomic data, demonstrates the reliability of this approach.
As seen for the Alpha variant here and by Jahn et al. (2021), genomic surveillance of wastewater can detect VOC earlier than clinical testing. In both instances, co-occurrence analysis improved confidence in (early) low-frequency variant detection by identifying multiple linked muta­ tions from the same virion instead of solely relying on single signature mutations. This requires the co-occurrence of mutations unique to a given variant on amplicons of the used sequencing scheme. When no unique mutation set is available, as for the Delta variant and the NimaGen SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing kit used here, reliable variant detection via co-occurrence analysis is not possible. The software developers have acknowledged this limitation, and the design of primers to create appropriate co-occurrence amplicons for relevant sequencing schemes is suggested as a workaround (Jahn et al., 2021). It is important to note that even in cases where co-occurrence analysis is applicable, our fine-scale local data highlighted that wastewater monitoring sometimes detects new variants earlier than clinical testing, but not always. The

reasons for this are yet unclear. It is likely that the inherent variability of wastewater detections, due to variations in viral shedding rates and dilution from rainfall (Polo et al., 2020), and the increasing stochasticity of clinical detection with decreasing population size play a role. It is also worth noting that these samples were almost entirely grab samples, which likely sample fewer clinical infections than composite samples. Certainly, the relationships between population size, wastewater flow variation and SARS-CoV-2 variant detection warrant further investigation.
The mixed pattern of wastewater Alpha variant detections preceding confirmed clinical cases in some parts of Liverpool, yet vice versa in others, highlights the complementarity of the approaches. Wastewater monitoring has the notable advantages of being more cost-effective per unit of population and is less biased by testing frequencies in different communities (Polo et al., 2020), while sequencing of clinical samples provides greater specificity and the opportunity for contact tracing. Indeed, our finding that the Alpha variant was detected in wastewater in North Liverpool much earlier than clinical cases had indicated, corre­ sponds well with findings from a large-scale asymptomatic testing campaign, which found that testing uptake was lower in North Liver­ pool, yet the rate of positive tests higher (Green et al., 2021). Clearly, a combination of genomic surveillance of clinical cases and wastewater is most likely to detect new variants as early as possible and provides the most precise picture of unfolding variant dynamics to inform public health measures (Mishra et al., 2021).
Intriguingly, when comparing peak Alpha and Delta variant fre­ quencies in corresponding clinical and wastewater data, we find that

6

each variant, in turn, reaches complete dominance in clinical but not wastewater samples, with estimated maximum frequencies of 100% and ~75% in clinical and wastewater samples, respectively. Correspond­ ingly, correlations between clinical and wastewater data appear stron­ ger in sampling areas with higher maximum frequency estimates in wastewater. It is notable that viral concentrations were low from March - May 2021, which corresponded to public health restrictions in the UK to contain infection numbers, and which led to lower sequence data quality for these samples. Improved viral concentration methods may mitigate this limitation (Kevill et al., 2022). Equally, better statistical methods may be required to estimate lineage frequencies from pooled sequencing data, as produced from wastewater samples (Amman et al., 2022; Karthikeyan et al., 2022). Here we have relied on a relatively crude estimation by taking the mean of signature SNP/Indel frequencies. However, genetic variation may mean that a SNP/Indel may not be present on all branches within a lineage, whereas a single fully phased viral genome from a clinical sample would be reliably assigned to a lineage. Following methods for analysing metagenomic amplicon data (Grubaugh et al., 2019; Quince et al., 2021; 2011), the development of statistical methods to infer lineage proportions from multiple amplicons while controlling for sequencing error may be productive.
The limited quality of sequences obtained from wastewater during April and May 2020 also highlights the current limits of variant detec­ tion via wastewater sequencing when case numbers, and hence SARSCoV-2 concentrations, are low. While the rise of Delta was evident in our results (Fig. 5), the transition from Alpha to Delta, compared to the gradual emergence of Alpha, was less visible and more abrupt. If new, more transmissible variants are associated with more rapid emergence and a quicker rise in frequency, this would highlight the need to develop more sensitive and accurate methods of variant detection and quantifi­ cation within wastewater. It is, however, anticipated that the increased adoption of wastewater-based epidemiology will drive innovation in wastewater sampling, concentration and RNA extraction, improving viral qPCR and sequencing sensitivity (Hillary et al., 2021; Kevill et al., 2022; Polo et al., 2020).
5. Conclusions
· We show that wastewater genomic sequencing can reliably detect the emergence and rise of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.
· Variant frequency estimates from wastewater sequencing correspond well with those obtained through genomic sequencing of clinical samples.
· In some cases, variants are observed in wastewater before clinical detections, which may be particularly useful in areas or communities with low testing uptake.

ABSTRACT
Higher education institutions (HEIs) have been embracing digital transformation for years, but the disruptive influence of the global COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated it. Despite the importance of organizational culture (OC) for the successful delivery of e-learning, empirical studies looking at its impact on academics' readiness and affective commitment to e-learning-induced changes are scant. This study unveils the underlying impacts of multiple employee readiness for change (ERFC) dimensions in the OC-employee affective commitment to change (EACC) relationship. Survey data were obtained from 1,200 Jordanian public HEIs' academics. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze the data, testing the study's six hypotheses. The findings offer a novel contribution by showing that OC types influence different dimensions of ERFC, each having a distinctive impact on EACC. It further shows that two ERFC dimensions, namely self-efficacy and personal valence, function as full mediators in the relationships between group culture/adhocracy culture and EACC.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in educational sys­ tems in a way never seen before. Even though the process of digital transformation in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) has been un­ derway for years, the disruptive influence of COVID-19 has accelerated the process, resulting in many fundamental changes within a matter of weeks as online learning became the primary method of teaching (Shehzadi et al., 2021; Yassin, Razak, Saeed, Al-Maliki, & Al-Habies, 2021). Shifting towards online learning was sudden and forced by the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 outbreak; hence, HEIs worldwide have faced multiple obstacles and teething problems adapt­ ing to this new setting (Al-Hyari, 2020; Müller, Goh, Lim, & Gao, 2021).
The adoption of e-learning changes, especially by academics, usually

falls short of HEIs aspirations ( Mehta, 2021). The short notice to switch to eLearning, combined with a lack of eLearning experience, resulted in stress and anxiety amongst academic staff in many HEIs (Müller et al., 2021). According to multiple researchers, one of the main reasons is the lack of academic staff readiness and affective commitment to imple­ menting various forms of disruptive online learning platforms (Marinoni et al., 2020). Thus, it is time to understand better the factors that in­ fluence academic readiness for and affective commitment to e-learning (hereafter called change) in HEIs (Alqabbani et al., 2020; Paliwal & Singh, 2021).
Amongst other contextual factors, organizational culture (OC) was identified as one of the most significant factors that could either enhance or hinder employee readiness for change (ERFC) and employee affective commitment to change (EACC) (Eby, Adams, Russell, & Gaby, 2000;

Choi & Ruona, 2011; Messner, 2013; Neubert & Cady, 2001; Schneck­ enberg, 2009; Shum, Bove, & Auh, 2008; Weiner, 2009). However, our literature review shows that the connection between OC, ERFC and EACC is still in its infancy and that there is a great need for it to be fully explored (Eby et al., 2000; Choi & Ruona, 2011; Morin, Meyer, B´elanger, Boudrias, Gagn´e, & Parker, 2016). In particular, our literature review search revealed an absence of specific empirical studies investigating the roles that multidimensional ERFC play as a mediating factor in the OC-EACC relationship.
This study offers a holistic perspective, rather than a partial one, by focusing on the influence of different aspects of organizational culture on EACC and ERFC dimensions. To this effect, the current study ad­ dresses the call of previous research studies (Haffar, Al-Karaghouli, & Ghoneim, 2013; Holt, Armenakis, Field, & Harris, 2007; Jones, Jim­ mieson, & Griffiths, 2005; Olafsen, Nilsen, Smedsrud, & Kamaric, 2021) to investigate the mediating effects of various dimensions of ERFC as novel underlying mechanisms of successful change.
This knowledge helps clarify the mechanisms through which different dimensions of ERFC are influenced by diverse types of OC and distinctively impact EACC. It also provides much-needed guidance for managerial practice to reduce resistance and improve successful echange implementation in HEIs.
Finally, research studies into organizational changes in HEIs are comparatively underdeveloped and focus on case studies of single in­ stitutions (Bleiklie, 2014; Vlachopoulos, 2021). The present study takes a different approach making three significant value contributions. Firstly, using all ten public HEIs in Jordan as the study population, a broader interrogation of data beyond single case studies is presented. It also allows for more robust data and, consequently, more credible generalizations. Secondly, it highlights empirical evidence from the global south with a fresh perspective from the Jordanian context. Thirdly, while the COVID-19 global pandemic adversely affected over 300,000 university learners in Jordan following the closure of the educational institutions and the movement to online learning (Alsoud & Harasis, 2021), simultaneously, it provided a unique opportunity to retroactively examine the impact of this quantum leap on education delivery and successful change.
This study investigates employees' readiness and affective commit­ ment to e-learning induced changes in the public HEIs within the novel geopolitical context of Jordan, whose culture is notably different to countries (mostly western) covered by previous studies. Jordan is located in the heart of the volatile and unstable Middle East, a country with a fragile, yet calm and shock-absorbing landscape (Al Khattab, Anchor, & Davies, 2008). As Jordanian public HEIs (JPHEIs) provide learning opportunities, they are considered the primary workforce provider not only for Jordanians but also for Syrian, Palestinian and Iraqi refugees (Al-Hyari, 2020).
By investigating the impact of OC on ERFC and EACC, this study provides useful recommendations for enhancing JPHEIs e-learning ef­ ficiency. In turn, this will enhance current efforts to prepare job-ready graduates who can find decent jobs in the Jordanian market. This would consequently support the reduction of the influx of refugees into Europe. Therefore, the overarching aim of this study is to investigate how organizational culture and affective commitment to change during the challenging period of COVID-19 can lead to the successful delivery of e-learning based on academics' readiness for change.
2. Theoretical background and hypotheses development
The work of Bandura (1986), who developed the conceptual framework of triadic reciprocity, or reciprocal connections between three sets of influences--behavioral, environmental, and person­ al--provides the theoretical underpinning for this study. Social cogni­ tive theory distinguishes between acquisition and performance because people do not always practice what they have learned (Bandura,1986). The central principle of Bandura's theory is that people strive for a sense

of agency or belief that they can apply considerable impact over important events in their lives (Bandura, 2011; Schunk & DiBenedetto, 2020). This premise "serves as the integrative principle in human selfdevelopment, adaptations, and change" (Bandura, 2011, p.349). In­ dividuals exert this influence utilizing their cognitive and self-regulatory abilities by identifying goals and applying tactics to reach them. Following that, they assess how well they are doing in terms of achieving their objectives and make adjustments to their approach as needed (Schunk & DiBenedetto, 2020). The theoretical model presented in this study is thus informed and used to explain the impact of organizational culture on fostering or hindering employees' readiness and affective commitment to e-learning. These relationships and this theory have not been tested before in the higher education and e-learning literature.
2.1. Conceptualizing employee readiness for change and its relationship with affective commitment to change
The resistance to change, and readiness for change of academics in elearning in HEIs have garnered increasing attention in recent years. Following the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, HEIs world­ wide have been forced to implement various disruptive online remote learning platforms (Alqabbani et al., 2020; Paliwal & Singh, 2021).
There is a growing body of scholarship that emphasizes the signifi­ cance of building ERFC and EACC (Haffar et al., 2013; Herold, Fedor, & Caldwell, 2007; Holt et al., 2007; Herscovitch & Meyer, 2002; Malik & Garg, 2017; Shum et al., 2008) as they reflect significant psychological issues encountered by employees who undergo major changes. ERFC stems from the notion of unfreezing developed by Kurt Lewin (1947/ 1997). Armenakis Harris, and Mossholder (1993, p.681) offered the first definition of micro readiness for change as an individual's "beliefs and intentions regarding the extent to which changes are needed and the organization's capacity to successfully undertake those change".
While several studies, like Jones et al. (2005) and Armenakis et al. (1993), viewed the ERFC as a one-dimensional construct, Holt et al. (2007) considered it a multidimensional concept comprising four di­ mensions. These were: "change-specific efficacy, personal benefit gained from change, management support during change and the appropri­ ateness of the change" (Holt et al., 2007, p.232).
On the other hand, Herold et al. (2007) argued that EACC is deter­ mined by the person's attitude toward change and their intention to provide support. Most studies advocate that ERFC is the most vital predictor of EACC (Herold et al., 2007; Holt et al., 2007; Neubert & Cady, 2001; Santhidran, Chandran, & Borromeo, 2013).
Many authors, such as Paliwal and Singh (2021), Salvato and Rerup (2011), and Herscovitch and Meyer (2002), observed that selfefficacious employees, or those with greater confidence in their ability to implement organizational changes, have higher EACC. Thus, it is hypothesized:
Hypothesis 1a. ERFC dimension `self-efficacy' has a positive relationship with EACC.
Furthermore, employees' affective commitment to change grows when they perceive a specific change as an efficient method for enhancing efficiency in their organization (Morin et al., 2016; Neves, 2009; Fedor, Caldwell, & Herold, 2006). Therefore, this study suggests that employees who are positive about the appropriateness of a change are more likely to be affectively committed to it.
Hypothesis 1b. ERFC dimension `appropriateness' has a positive rela­ tionship with EACC.
In the same vein, Walker, Armenakis, and Bernerth (2007) concluded that employees will be willing to adopt change rather than see it as an obligation if top management communicates effectively that imple­ menting the change is in the organization's best interests. Furthermore, Fedor et al. (2016) argue that leaders, not only at the top management level, but also at middle- or lower levels, need to be change-oriented in

2

their behavior to increase the likelihood of the team's receptiveness, affective commitment and engagement toward the change agenda. Based on this, one can posit that good management of employee readi­ ness for change would result in higher EACC.
Hypothesis 1c. ERFC dimension `management support' has a positive relationship with EACC.
The human resource (HR) practice of rewarding employees is considered an integral part of ensuring a positive employee attitude towards change (Conway & Monks, 2008). Furthermore, Vakola (2014) and Choi and Ruona (2011) stated that employees who expect benefits such as a promotion would show higher levels of affective commitment to organizational change. Thus, we posit that:
Hypothesis 1d. ERFC dimension `personal valence' has a positive rela­ tionship with EACC.
2.2. Conceptualizing the impact of organizational culture on employee affective commitment to change and readiness for change
Multiple authors stress that different organizational culture types influence the level of ERFC (Choi & Ruona, 2011; Eby et al., 2000; Schneckenberg, 2009; Weiner, 2009) and EACC in different ways (Malik and Garg, 2017; Messner, 2013; Shum et al., 2008; Neubert and Cady, 2001). For example, HEIs dominated by a hierarchy culture do not inspire invention and novelty among their employees (Maddux & Johnson, 2010; Zammuto et al., 2000). In these institutions, stability and rigid rules are emphasized. Consequently, employees in these organi­ zations are more likely to avoid taking risks and exhibit a low degree of readiness and commitment to changes (Cunningham, 2006; Cunning­ ham, Woodward, Shannon, MacIntosh, Lendrum, Rosenbloom, & Brown, 2002; Maddux & Johnson, 2010; McKay, Kuntz, & Na¨swall, 2013; Neves, 2009). Therefore, it is hypothesized as follows:
Hypothesis 2a. Hierarchy culture will have a negative relationship with ERFCs.
Hypothesis 2b. Hierarchy culture will have a negative relationship with EACC.
Cameron and Quinn (1999) argue that organizations characterized by an adhocracy culture encourage an individual's inventiveness, which boosts the efficiency of the organization (Dextras-Gauthier and March­ and, 2016; Hartnell et al., 2011). This innovative culture that avoids hierarchy is one of the main reasons that made Apple such a successful business. It is noteworthy here the central argument of Steve Jobs was that organizations "have to be run by ideas, not by hierarchy" (Harbott, 2021., p.76).
To this effect, ERFC is positively related to the values of an adhocracy culture (Olafsen, et al., 2021; Jones et al., 2005; Zammuto et al., 2000). Thus:
Hypothesis 3a. An adhocracy culture will have a positive relationship with ERFCs.
Similarly, organizations dominated by an adhocracy culture are regarded as diverse and creative workplaces that value agility and change. All employees are encouraged to take charge of change-related issues, and mistakes are tolerated while constructive criticism is accepted (McAdam & Donaghy, 1999; Odom, Boxx, & Dunn, 1990; Olafsen, et al., 2021). Thus, it is argued that such a culture that em­ phasizes flexibility and encourages creativity positively impacts EACC.
Hypothesis 3b. An adhocracy culture will have a positive relationship with EACC.
Jones et al. (2005) enlighten that in institutions dominated by group culture, organizational members suppose they obtain great benefits by actively participating in the change process. Similarly, Snape and Red­ man (2010) consider training one of the most significant HR practices

valued by employees as it demonstrates that the organization wants to invest in them in the long term. Therefore, this study proposes that employees are more likely to show high readiness for change in orga­ nizations characterized by a group culture.
Hypothesis 4a. Group culture will have a positive relationship with ERFCs.
These organizations offer employees greater job autonomy and participation in decision-making in a team-oriented environment (Neubert & Cady, 2001). Furthermore, the staff in such organizations are encouraged to share their perspectives and opinions to make rele­ vant joint decisions (Shum et al., 2008). To this end, we suggest that increased participation in decision-making will raise EACC. The pre­ ceding discussion leads us to put forward the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 4b. Group culture will have a positive relationship with EACC.
Authors such as Zammuto et al. (2000) and Cameron and Quinn (1999) claimed that institutions characterized by a market culture are more concerned with performing the required work and enhancing profits, with less consideration for employees' morale and wellbeing. Consequently, employees of such institutions have a tendency to exhibit lower degrees of readiness for change.
Hypothesis 5a. Market culture will have a negative relationship with ERFCs.
Organizational justice theory indicates that any change or trans­ formation initiative should have the potential to benefit not only com­ panies but also their employees (Luo et al., 2016). This is mostly not the case in organizations driven by a result-oriented ethos. Studies have indicated that employees working in such organizations are likely to perceive any change as being valuable to their organizations' manage­ ment (Feng, Robin, Fan, & Huang 2020; Haffar, Al-Hyari, Djebarni, AlShamali, Aziz, & Al-Shamali, 2021; Neubert & Cady, 2001; Shum et al., 2008). Therefore, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 5b. Market culture will have a negative relationship with EACC.
2.3 Mediating effect of employee readiness for change on the relationship between organizational culture and employee affective commitment to change
The direct-impact arguments for the relationship between OC on EACC seem to be persuasive. Nevertheless, a deeper examination of the literature suggests that OC impacts EACC through its influence on ERFC. That is, ERFC mediates the OC-EACC relationship.
The social cognitive theory principles, developed by Bandura (1986), are used to clarify the mediating role ERFC plays between OC types and EACC. Research indicates that when ERFC is high, employees would be more likely to commit to change by putting more energy into imple­ menting change and show more tenacity to overcome hindrances to change during the implementation process (Gist & Mitchell, 1992; Weiner, 2009). Thus, it is proposed that ERFC mediates the influence of OC types on employee affective commitment to change.
Hypothesis 6. ERFC mediates the influence of organizational culture types on EACC.
Fig. 1 shows the proposed theoretical model of the current study, which was created by logically combining both the direct effect of OC on EACC and the indirect influence that OC has on EACC through ERFC. Drawing from social cognitive theory, this framework postulates that the more supportive the organization's culture, the higher ERFC will be and the higher the level of EACC. These relationships and this theory have not been tested before in the higher education and e-learning literature.

3. Methodology
3.1. Sample and procedure
The research population consisted of all the academic staff (2,782) of the social sciences faculties affiliated with all ten Jordanian public Higher Education Institutions (JPHEIs) that applied e-learning tools for educational continuity from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak (MOHE, 2020).
A sample of 1,200 academic staff was selected using a stratified random sampling method employing proportional allocation to attain a representative target sample. The rationale for this method was the opportunity to obtain more accurate estimates than would be the case with simple random sampling. This is helpful when the population comprises several homogenous groups and makes the study more sta­ tistically robust.
As the teaching styles are similar, we focused on academic staff working in social science faculties only, including business, psychology, and law. The final sample ensured all social science faculty members within JPHEIs were proportionally represented. The number of distrib­ uted surveys varied according to the number of faculty members within each faculty in order to maintain the correct proportions. The ques­ tionnaires were, in particular, distributed amongst 43 % of staff at social science faculties in each university. As an example, we distributed sur­ veys to 359 social science faculty members at Al-Balqa University (43 % of its 834 social science faculty members), In contrast, we distributed 258 questionnaires to the social science faculty at The University of Jordan (43 % of the total 597 academics), and so on.
The data were collected during the COVID-19 outbreak, specifically from October 15th, 2020, to January 15th, 2021. The choice of this period is vital because of the unlikely ex post facto research opportunity it presents following massive global changes in education delivery brought about by the onset of COVID-19 and the ensuing impact on staff, students, and the management of change in HEIs. The instrument was administered online within each of the ten JPHEIs. Response rates were monitored regularly, with reminder messages sent to prospective re­ spondents to increase the response rate. A total of 783 online ques­ tionnaires were returned in all after three months. Of these, 776 questionnaires were usable. This translates into an overall usable response rate of 64.6 %.

3.2. Measures
We adopted and translated four valid and reliable instruments to achieve the aim of the current study. A review of previous studies in­ dicates that most scales used to evaluate ERFC measure one aspect of ERFC and treat it as a unidimensional construct (Jones et al., 2005; Cunningham et al., 2002). However, one instrument with high reli­ ability and validity represents a multidimensional construct, which was developed by Holt et al. (2007). This instrument is complementary yet distinctive to the instrument formulated by Hersocovitch and Meyer (2002) that assesses commitment to change. Holt et al. (2007) empha­ sized that the level of EACC is influenced by the level of four dimensions of ERFC. Therefore, we have used the scale developed by Holt and his colleagues (2007) to evaluate the level of ERFC components.
Additionally, we have utilized Herscovitch and Meyer's (2002) scale to measure EACC. We also used the exceptionally reliable and valid Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI) developed by Cameron and Quinn (1999) to identify the cultural profile and charac­ teristics of JPHEIs. Multiple studies have used this scale due to its sig­ nificance in diagnosing organizational culture (Prajogo & McDermott, 2011) and defining the needed changes to boost change implementation success (Haffar, Al-Karaghouli, & Ghoneim, 2014). This scale includes four OC types: "adhocracy culture, group culture, market culture and hierarchy culture". A five-point Likert scale was used to measure the 24 items of OCAI as used by Dellana and Hauser (1999).
The questionnaire was professionally translated using back trans­ lation and was pre-tested in a pilot study. Experts and academics from the JPHEIs checked the questionnaire's content validity before distri­ bution to the target sample. Following the pilot study, the experts and academics agreed to minor editing. The modifications were specifically regarding a few typographical errors made to the translated version, following which all reviewers considered the questionnaire fit for purpose.
3.3. Common method bias
To decrease the likelihood of common method bias (CMB), different procedures and measures were utilized. As recommended by Podsakoff, MacKenzie and Podsakoff (2012), we split and randomly ordered the statements pertaining to the independent, mediating, and dependent

4

M. Haffar et al.
variables into different parts of the questionnaire to prevent learning process bias while answering the questions. We also approached mul­ tiple participants (at least 30) from each HEIs to complete the surveys. This approach increases the degree of confidence in the results and lessen the impact of systematic response bias (Boyer and Verma, 2000).
To ensure that there is no common method bias problem, we used Harman's single factor test to assess whether all variables loaded onto one general factor (Podsakoff et al., 2012). In addition, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to compare the one-factor model, where all variables are allowed to load onto one general factor, with the hypothesized nine-factor model. The combined evidence (2 = 289.1, 2 /df = 8.03, SRMR = 0.11, RMSEA = 0.095, CFI = 0.44) showed that the one-factor model did not fit the data sufficiently, indicating that com­ mon method variance was not marked in the data-set.
The CFA results also showed that the nine-factor baseline model had a reasonable fit (2 = 38.92; 2 /df = 3.24, SRMR = 0.041, RMSEA = 0.053, CFI = 0.945), and yielded a significantly better fit than the singlefactor model (2 (5) = 250.10, p < .01). Consequently, it can be safely concluded that CMB was unlikely and had no significant impact following Harman's single-factor test. It can also be concluded that, since the nine-factor model has a satisfactory fit, the nine latent con­ structs (i.e., group culture, adhocracy culture, market culture, hierarchy culture, personally beneficial, management support, self-efficacy, appropriateness, EACC) were distinct constructs and provided evi­ dence for the satisfactory discriminant validity.
3.4. Validity and reliability
CFA was used to assess the construct validity of each construct. Standardized factor loadings of all indicators ranged from 0.692 to greater than 0.947 and were statistically significant (p < .01), as shown in Table 1. Additionally, coefficients alpha ( = 0.7), composite reli­ ability (CR. = 0.7), and average variance extracted (AVE) across the constructs were well above the threshold values recommended by many studies (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010; Fornell & Larcker, 1981). Thus, convergent validity was supported.
Discriminant validity is supported as the AVE for all the constructs is bigger than 0.50, and the square root of AVE is bigger than the con­ struct's correlation coefficient square with other constructs, as shown in Table 2 (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). Cronbach's alpha is utilized to assess the internal consistency of scales. All  coefficient of the constructs surpassed the 0.7 (Hair et al., 2010; Nunnally, 1978), ranging from 0.866 to 0.914, which confirm the scale reliability.
3.5. Results of structural equation modelling analyses
Structural equation modelling (SEM) simplifies the testing of medi­ ation hypotheses. It performs better than multiple regression for more complicated mediation models handling multiple mediators to multiple independent variables or outcomes (Gunzler, Chen, Wu, & Zhang, 2013). Hence, SEM was used to analyze the data. However, we ensured that the sample size requirements were met before testing our

Journal of Business Research 155 (2023) 113396
hypotheses. Many recommendations and rules of thumb are found in the literature to identify sample size requirements in SEMs. In this study, the sample size (returned and usable responses) was N = 776 and the number of variables V = 9. Thus, the ratio N/V equals 86.2:1, surpassing the value of 20:1 threshold (Hair et al., 2010).
We also computed the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA), as it is the most sensitive index of models with misspecified factor loadings (Sila, 2007). Table 3 reveals that the RMSEA for all models are<0.10 indicating a good fit to the data. However, to decrease the impact of sample size in evaluating model fit, we used both CFI and SRMR to assess model fit because they are relatively uninfluenced by sample size (Hooper, Coughlan, and Mullen, 2008). Table 3 shows that the SRMR values ranged from 0.036 to 0.048, and the CFI values ranged from 0.943 to 0.968, indicating a good model fit.
We utilized the four-step technique suggested by Howell (2009) to assess the mediation linkages in light of numerous recent studies (e.g., Arya, Mirchandani, & Harris, 2019). Firstly, we examined a model comprising direct links from OC types to EACC. This model indicates that group culture and adhocracy culture have positive impact on EACC 0.238** (p < .01), and 0.204** (p < .01) respectively. Thus, H3b and H4b are supported. However, the impact of market culture 0.061 (p > .05) and hierarchy culture - 0.112 (p > .05) are not significant; there­ fore, H5b and H2b are rejected. As such, examining for mediation for these variables breaches the first test criteria.
Our results also show that the paths from the group ( = 0.316**, p < .01) and adhocracy culture ( = 0.262**, p < .01) types to self-efficacy (ERFC1) are significant. In contrast, the direct path from hierarchy and market to self-efficacy is not. Additionally, the standardized path co­ efficients from group culture and adhocracy culture to ERFC4- personal valence were significant and in the expected directions: 0.406** (p < .01), 0.351** (p < .01), respectively, while the direct path from hier­ archy and market to ERFC4 are not. On the other hand, the findings showed that the direct paths from group ( = 0.260**, p < .05), market culture ( = 0.164**, p < 0.05), and adhocracy culture ( = 0.174**, p < 0.05) to ERFC3- management support, are significant. We then exam­ ined the effect of the mediators ERFCs on EACC. The findings indicated that the direct links from two of ERFC dimensions namely self-efficacy ( = 0.313**, p < .01) and ERFC4- personal valence ( = 0.362**, p < .01) are positive and significant, supporting H1a and H1d.
Based on the findings in Figs. 2 and 3, a comparison of Models 4 and 5 shows that the direct relationship between the independent variables (group and adhocracy culture types) and the dependent variable (EACC) became non-significant after the mediators (ERFC1- change efficacy and ERFC4- personal benefit) were included (changing from a statistically significant.238** to an insignificant.102 and from a significant 204** to an insignificant 0.94, respectively), hence filling the fourth condition.
We then compared two models, namely the M4 model (which shows full mediation) and with M5 model (partial mediation model), to un­ derstand which model fits better with the data.
M4 illustrates that the direct links from the adhocracy culture and group culture to personal valence and self-efficacy (mediators), and from the personal valence and self-efficacy (mediators) to EACC, are

significant. The statistics for the M5 model exhibit acceptable fit indices, while the full mediation model shows a better match to the data. The significance level of the difference between the two models was also determined using the chi-square difference test, also known as a likeli­ hood ratio test (Prajogo & Sohal, 2006). We further investigated the significance level of the difference between the two models by calcu­ lating the discrepancy of the 2 values (49.33 and 57.4) with the dif­ ference in the degree of freedom (17 and 15). The outcome was 2 of 8.07 with df of 2 is bigger than the value of 5.99 (p < .05).
In addition, personal valence (ERFC4) and self-efficacy (ERFC1) as mediators diminish the strength of the effect of adhocracy culture/group culture on EACC after including ERFC-personal valence and the direct influence of adhocracy culture and group culture on EACC became nonsignificant. These results support the full mediation proposition.

This shows that ERFC-personal valence and ERFC-change efficacy fully mediated the relationship between adhocracy culture/group culture and EACC.
The significance of the mediating roles of personal valence and change efficacy was further confirmed by the bias-corrected bootstrap. As shown in Table 4, the findings indicated that group culture and adhocracy culture have positive impacts on EACC via personal valence ( = 0.19, 95 % CI = 0.13 to 0.24) and ( = 0.22, 95 % CI = 0.18 to 0.27) respectively, and this is a full mediation. Also, the positive influence of group culture and adhocracy culture on EACC is mediated by ERFCchange efficacy ( = 0.31, 95 % CI = 0.20 to 0.41) and ( = 0.26, 95 % CI = 0.21 to 0.32). These findings indicated that ERFC-personal valence and ERFC-change efficacy completely mediate the relationship between adhocracy culture/group culture and EACC.

4. Discussion
This study examines the mediating impact of ERFC dimensions in the relationship between OC and EACC in JPHEIs. The findings of the pre­ sent study support the results of Holt et al. (2007), who treated employee readiness for change as a multidimensional construct and concluded that the ERFC components are distinct. A few authors, such as Conway and Monks (2008), Choi and Ruona (2011), Paliwal and Singh (2021), Salvato and Rerup (2011) have concluded that ERFC-selfefficacy and ERFC-personal valence are associated with higher levels of EACC. The same results have been demonstrated in JPHEIs, where the level of EACC is positively affected by self-efficacy and personal valence.
We proposed that ERFC-appropriateness has a positive effect on EACC. It was expected that academics who believed that e-learning changes were appropriate and beneficial for the organization would be keener to implement the change effectively. That hypothesis was not supported, however. These disparate findings suggest that the impact of the perception of appropriateness on affective commitment to change initiatives (e-learning changes) may be influenced by the characteristics of the group undergoing changes, which would alter these relationships. For example, it seems that employees value change less in organizations that do not have a high level of humane orientation and are dominated by hierarchy culture, such as JPHEIs. This could be viewed because of the organization's lack of attention to employee welfare. In contrast, employees are more interested in rewards that benefit them and are more concerned about themselves than with the organization.

Overall, the findings of our study show that OC has a considerable impact on employees' readiness and affective commitment to change. This supports the results of previous studies which concluded that OC is a vital contextual construct that moderates ERFC levels (Eby et al., 2000; Vakola & Nikolaou, 2005; Weiner, 2009) and EACC levels (Richard, McMillan-Capehart, Bhuian & Taylor, 2009; McKinnon, Harrison, Chow, & Wu, 2003; Odom et al., 1990). According to some previous research (Richard et al., 2009; McKinnon et al., 2003; Odom et al., 1990), group and adhocracy cultures were related to higher levels of EACC and ERFC. Meanwhile, research work conducted by other re­ searchers (Eby et al., 2000; Jones et al., 2005; Zammuto et al., 2000) found market culture to be related to lower levels of ERFC. We found similar results in JPHEIs where both group culture and adhocracy cul­ ture have a significant positive impact on EACC. However, their impact was only on three out of four ERFC dimensions (self-efficacy, personal valence, and management support). Also, the influences of group culture and adhocracy culture on self-efficacy and personal valence are more significant than their influence on ERFC-management support. It ap­ pears that group and adhocracy culture types, which have a significant influence on EACC and ERFC, render the impact of a hierarchy culture relatively less significant. It is clear from these results that an elevated level of ERFC is dependent upon the existence of the values of both group and adhocracy culture. Such values motivate employees to be more willing to adopt change and actively get involved in the imple­ mentation process. However, based on the SEM analysis, the results from this study indicate that group culture has a higher and more significant

impact, followed by adhocracy culture on ERFC-self-efficacy and ERFCpersonal valence in JPHEIs. It seems that employees' attitude toward change in JPHEIs is influenced more by group culture values, which stress the long-term benefits of organizational members and attach more standing to morale, followed by an adhocracy culture which stimulates individual initiatives and creativity. In other words, they give more weight to group culture values when formulating their attitude towards change.
The results further show that self-efficacy and personal valence

function as a full mediator to canalize the impact of group culture/ adhocracy culture on EACC. Our study supports the findings of previous studies, which indicate a positive impact of group and adhocracy OC on EACC (McKinnon et al., 2003; Richard et al., 2009; Shum et al., 2008). However, the results of our analysis indicated that both ERFC-selfefficacy and ERFC-personal valence fully mediate the OC-EACC rela­ tionship. The evidence presented above indicates that employees who observed strong group and adhocracy values in their organizations showed higher levels of self-efficacy and personal valence and showed more affective commitment towards change implementation.
These findings go one step further by displaying that the influences of group and adhocracy culture on EACC are canalized by ERFC-selfefficacy and ERFC-personal valence. This may suggest that the effect of organizational culture is a successive process impacting ERFC and, in turn, EACC, as opposed to the conventional belief that it simultaneously influences both ERFC and EACC. Our findings indicate that a higher level of EACC is not a direct result of OC but rather of ERFC1-selfefficacy and ERFC4-personal valence transmitting the influence of group and adhocracy culture to EACC. Thus, incorporating the medi­ ating roles of self-efficacy and personal valence will help us better un­ derstand the relationship between corporate culture and EACC.
The findings also expand the research of Jones et al. (2005) by of­ fering empirical evidence about the association between organizational culture and ERFC by also including EACC in this relationship. The empirical evidence of the mediation of ERFCs in the connection between

OC types and EACC contributes significantly to describing the underly­ ing psychological mechanisms in the OCs-EACC relationship.
4.1. Theoretical implications
The current research addresses the call of previous research studies (Haffar et al., 2013; Holt et al., 2007; Jones et al., 2005; Olafsen et al., 2021) to investigate the mediating role of different dimensions of ERFC as novel underlying mechanisms to implement successful e-learning change in the context of HEIs. Drawing from social cognitive theory, we developed and validated a framework that integrates the direct effect of organizational culture with its indirect impact (via ERFC dimensions) on EACC.
By presenting and supporting both the direct and indirect differential impacts of OC types on EACC, the current research provides novel evi­ dence that will help theorize the mechanisms of the connection between OC and EACC to provide a better understanding of the relationship be­ tween OC, ERFC and EACC. Our findings show that different dimensions of ERFC are influenced by OC types, each having a distinctive impact on EACC. This aids in identifying the most vital ERFC dimensions organi­ zations should prioritize to enhance the level of EACC, particularly during the challenging period of COVID-19.
The relationships mentioned above have not been previously tested in the higher education and e-learning literature. This study contributes toward investigating employees' attitudes and affective commitment to e-learning changes in HEIs, particularly during the challenging period of COVID-19.
A significant theoretical contribution of this study is the role of social cognitive theory's behavioral, environmental, and personal components in generating and driving change in HEIs. Based on the findings of this study, HEIs must consider the association between academic staff readiness and affective commitment to e-learning changes to success­ fully implement online learning during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. When individuals contribute to substantive changes in the online learning environment at various times of their careers, they indirectly influence notable events in their lives. This conviction un­ derscores the very essence of the theory and is verified by our findings.
4.2. Practical implications
The concept of online learning seems to be here to stay. A paradigm shift was established in the teaching practices of the HEIs within months of the start of the coronavirus pandemic as academics acquired online experience. HEIs must be encouraged to think about online learning and train their academic staff to become proficient with the relevant tech­ nologies and software related to learning and teaching.
Another important implication is that the government and educa­ tional units must enhance infrastructure provisions and support for elearning following the unexpected challenges posed by COVID-19. This would benefit both students and HEIs as well as ensure the alignment of Jordanian HEIs to global best practices following any future unexpected disruption.
To optimize the e-learning-induced changes and implementation processes in JPHEIs, change agents must ensure that all employees are ready to commit to e-learning change-induced efforts. To do so, they must first assess the current level of ERFC and EACC and identify whether current dominant organizational culture types are supportive of e-learning induced changes. Low levels of ERFC and EACC in JPHEIs should be considered an indicator for organizations to identify problems that hinder successful change implementation. This would help deter­ mine the required actions to enhance e-learning implementation success in JPHEIs.
This study has demonstrated that to raise the ERFC level and enhance the possibility of EACC in JPHEIs, top management in JPHEIs need to establish supportive organizational culture values that facilitate the successful implementation of change. This would help them modify their

prevailing culture towards group and adhocracy culture values by embracing flexible policies and stressing the involvement of academics and other professional staff.
As the results showed that self-efficacy and personal valence are the two most essential ERFC factors mediating group culture/adhocracy culture and EACC, we recommend that JPHEIs prioritize these di­ mensions to enhance academic staff commitment to e-learning changes. The change agents need to encourage ERFC and develop positive atti­ tudes amongst their employees towards e-learning change applications by paying more attention to HR practices valued by academic staff, such as promotions, training and development. While doing so, top man­ agement in JPHEIs should emphasize the advantages of long-term profits (personal valence) and focus on employee improvements, including providing staff with training on the execution of new practices to help them alter their behaviors to amalgamate with the continuous change culture. This will automatically lead to strengthening em­ ployees' feelings of self-efficacy and fostering affective commitment to e-learning and various forms of remote learning disruptive platforms.
5. Conclusion
Although HEIs have offered online education for many years, the COVID-19 pandemic created an exponential demand for it. COVID-19 has been an unusual challenge for academic delivery in HEIs, one which has required a well-reasoned response and, thus, provided an ex post facto research opportunity. The aim of this study was to identify the impact of organizational culture on the affective commitment to elearning-induced change and mediating impact of academic staff read­ iness for e-learning in this relationship during the earlier months of the pandemic COVID 19. To address the aim, this study collected data via a survey from Jordanian public Higher Education Institutions' academics between October 2020 and January 2021. Overall, the findings of our work show that OC types influence different dimensions of ERFC, and each has a distinctive influence on EACC. Thus, our study provides a deep understanding of the connection between OC, ERFC and EACC, which has been overlooked in previous research. This will help leaders in higher education increase employee readiness for e-learning changes during and after the COVID-19 outbreak, particularly since e-learning remains essential to HEIs to maintain curricula delivery during emer­ gencies and crises. After the study's conclusions, the following section explains its limitations and future directions of this research.
5.1. Study limitations and further research
Despite the fact that the study's objectives were met, some limita­ tions should be should be mentioned. Firstly, a cross-sectional research design was used in this research. Unfortunately, such a design does little to help us understand the causal relationship between the variables investigated. To investigate change over time to allow for causal re­ lationships to be identified, we suggest using longitudinal designs in future studies. Secondly, the current research collected data by means of self-reporting surveys, might increase the risk of CMV (Cooper-Thomas et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the self-reporting approach is seen as sensi­ ble for examining psychological variables (Morin et al., 2016). More­ over, the statistical findings of Harman's single-factor test showed that CMV did not exist in our research scales and had no substantial influence on our results. Nonetheless, future studies should use several sources to evaluate the variables and decrease CMV.

Abstract Purpose The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has significantly impacted people's lives. This study aimed to examine the influence of the unexpected second wave of COVID-19 on sleep quality and anxiety of Chinese residents in Beijing in June 2020, compared with the initial outbreak at the beginning of 2020, and to investigate the associated factors.
Methods Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 1,511 participants. assessed with demographic information, sleep quality and anxiety symptoms. The participants were asked to compare their recent sleep and sleep during the first outbreak. The Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to assess their current insomnia severity. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of sleep disturbance and anxiety symptom.
Results The overall prevalence of sleep disturbance and anxiety symptoms were 50.8% and 15.3% respectively. People had significantly shorter sleep duration during the second wave of
COVID-19(7.3±1.3) h than the first outbreak (7.5±1.4)h (p0.001). During the second
outbreak, people were less concerned about infection and more concerned about financial stress and occupational inferference. Beijing residents did not have significant differences in sleep disturbance and anxiety compared with other regions, nor were occupations and nucleic acid testing associated risk factors. Home quarantine, health administrators, history of insomnia and anxiety-depression were significantly associated with sleep disturbance. Female gender, home quarantine, history of insomnia and anxiety-depression were significantly associated with anxiety.
Conclusion High prevalence of sleep disturbance and depression symptom was common during the second wave of COVID-19 crisis in Beijing. Home quarantine and previous history of insomnia and anxiety-depressive risk factors were associated with sleep disturbance and anxiety. Female gender was impacting predictor of anxiety. We need continuous assessment of the sleep quality and anxiety symptoms of this epidemic.

1. Introduction The Covid-19 outbreak has so far become the greatest and most widespread
public health event in this century[1]. The outbreak has spread over 100 countries, with over 100 million confirmed cases and more than 2 millon deaths attributable to this disease reported worldwide[2].
With all efforts directed towards fighting COVID-19, the pandemic was largely brought under control in China by mid- April. However, Beijing's confirmation of a COVID-19 case on 11 June ended its 55-day streak without reported local transmission. The number of confirmed cases exceeded 100 in just five days, forcing the government to step up emergency footing as the virus flared up again in Beijing by implementing the most stringent control measures, from mass nucleic acid testing, home quarantine to city lockdowns. The second wave of COVID-19 in Beijing generated new pressure on people's daily lives, health, economic well-being and social interactions
According to previous studies about the public health emergency, anxiety, depression and stress levels in the general population could increase and these negative emotions would have an influence on sleep quality[3].Currently, many studies and surveys have reported sleep disturbance and other negative psychological impacts of epidemic [4]. COVID-19 challenges continue across the world, but there is still a lack of relevant research about sleep and mood fluctuations after exposure to repeated epidemics. Therefore a web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on sleep and mental health to explore the factors associated with sleep disturbance and anxiety syndrome. This research will help healthcare professionals and policy makers to make targeted intervention strategies for the public's sleep and psychological problems during the COVID-19 outbreak, and offer further support for the work resumption and related public policies.
2. Materials and methods 2.1 Setting and participants
Participants answered the questionnaires anonymously online from 22 June 2020 to 26 June 2020. This web-based survey of sleep quality and anxiety due to COVID-19 was distributed on the Internet through the WeChat public platform. Chinese residents were invited to answer the questionnaire by scanning the Quick Response code (QR code). The questionnaire is set on an online crowdsourcing platform in mainland China. When the participants click on the link, they are taken to an electronic form, starting with a description of study objectives, consent to participation and other ethical points. This web-based questionnaire was completely voluntary and non-commercial.
2.2 Tools and techniques This study used a self-administered Chinese questionnaire to collect data. The
questionnaire consisted of 34 structured, closed-ended questions. The questionnaire was divided into three domains: socio-demographics, self-reported sleep questionnaire, and Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS)[5]. The details of self-reported sleep questionnaire are provided as supplemental data (Tables S1-S4). In order to ensure the quality of the

survey, all questions were compulsory except for seven questions pertaining only to healthcare workers. Based on a pilot test, the research team estimated that it would take each participant around 2.5 to 10 min to complete the questionnaire. Questionnaires that were completed <150 seconds were excluded from the analysis.
2.3 Variables All subjects reported their demographic data and COVID-19 related information.
Demographic variables included gender (male or female), age, occupationeducation
level and residential location. Healthcare professionals including nurses, physicians, administrative staff, physicians in trainee, technicians, pharmacist, laboratory staff, radiology department technician etc. Based on the self-administered surveys, sleep disturbance levels were grouped as normal, mild-moderate, severe, or extreme. Levels of anxiety were assessed using Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), which is widely used for adult subjects, including an anxiety level rating questionnaire based on the symptoms of anxiety disorders as described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-II). SAS scale is short self-administered surveys, each with 20 questions scored on a 4-point Likert scale subsequently multiplied by 1.25 for a guaranteed score. There was a positive correlation between the anxiety score and the anxiety tendency, and the critical value was a standard score of 50. Scores ranging from 50 to 59 correspond to low anxiety, scores ranging from 60 to 69 correspond to moderate anxiety, while scores over 69 correspond to high perceived anxiety.
2.4 Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 3.6.3,
http://www.R-project.org). Continuous variables were summarized by descriptive analysis, reported as arithmetic mean (x) and standard deviation (SD). The differences in population characteristics were compared using t-test, Man-Whitney U test or Pearson chi-squared test, accordingly. Univariate logistic regression with crude odds ratios (OR) was used to identify potential factors associated with sleep disturbance and anxiety. Covariates adjusted in the models included sex, age, educational attainment, occupation, region, psychological and sleeping disorder history and underlying disease. Variables that were significant predictors (p<0.05) in the univariate analysis would be considered in the multivariate analysis. The identified covariates were presented in terms of Odds Ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For all comparisons, differences were tested using two-tailed tests and p<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
2.5 Ethical Consideration The Research Ethics Committee (REC) of the Healthcare Research Committee,
Peking University First Hospital, approved the research. As participation was voluntary and survey responses were anonymous, the REC ruled that this study did not require informed consent. No incentive or reward was given for study participation. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the committee of Peking University First Hospital. We performed all procedures following the guidelines of our institutional ethics

committee and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
3. Results 3.1 Sample characteristics
Characteristics of participants are presented in Table 1. The current study collected
1,622 questionnairesand after exclusion of questionnaires completed in under 150
seconds, enrolled 1,511 participants who provided usable responses, with a response rate of 93.2%, including 449 (29.7%) males and 1,062(70.3%) females. More than three quarters of the participants were young or middle-aged residents. 1,192(78.9%) were under 45 years old and 1,465(96.9%) participants had a bachelor's or higher degree. Among these samples, 1,195(79.1%) were residents in Beijing, 669 (44.3%) of participants were healthcare workers. 95 (6.3%) participants reported home quarantine during the survey period. 793 (52.5%) participants were subjected to a nasopharyngeal swab for coronavirus.
3.2 Prevalence of sleep disturbance and anxiety The overall prevalence of sleep disturbance and anxiety was 50.8% and 15.3%,
respectively (Table 1). There was no statistically significant diff erence in the prevalence of sleep disturbance and anxiety by occupation, region and underlying disease. Women had a significantly higher prevalence of anxiety than men (p =0.004). There was a significant difference in sleep disturbance between different groups of educational levels (p =0.005). Compared with other health groups, patients with a history of insomnia and anxiety-depression reported a higher rate of poor sleep quality and anxiety during the fresh outbreak of COVID-19 (p<0.001). Habitual snorers had a higher risk of sleep disturbance than others (p<0.001).
And more notably, in the current study, only 80 (5.29%) participants suffered from a more severe form of sleep disturbance than the first outbreak, including waking up early, nighttime awakenings and insomnia. Meanwhile only 156 (10.3%) participants reported more severe anxiety.
3.3 Comparison of sleep time Sleep duration in the second wave in Beijing was shorter than that in the
first outbreak (7.5h±1.4h vs. 7.3h±1.3h, p0.001). We then compared the bedtime
among the participants according to the self-reported degree of sleep disturbance during the two outbreaks (Table 2). In different groups of sleep disturbance, there was significant
difference of bedtime during the first outbreak (p <0.001)but no difference during the
second wave of COVID-19 (p = 0.577).
3.4 Self-reported COVID-19-related factors associated with sleep disturbance Tables 3 shows the self-reported COVID-19-related factors associated with sleep
disturbance. Complaints reported by the general public in order of decreasing frequency

are occupational interference by COVID-19(449, 29.7%), fear of COVID-19 pandemic(325, 21.5%), reduced income(320, 21.2%), travel restrictions(288, 19.1%) and children or aged persons left unattended(176, 11.6%). Only 5% of participants had previously traveled to a high-risk epidemic region and feared infection. The differences between various sleep
disorder groups are significant(p0.001). In the moderate and severe sleep disturbance
groups, besides worrying about COVID-19. job stress and reduced income are the most important factors associated with sleep disturbance.
3.5 Predictors of sleep disturbance and anxiety symptom Regression analyses were used to investigate the associated factors of sleep
disturbance during the second COVID-19 outbreak (Table 4). We put several potential factors into the analysis including education degree,
occupation, home quarantine, a history of psychological and sleeping disorders, anxiety status scored by SAS. All the significant factors in univariate logistic regression were included in the multivariate regression model, which indicated that health administrators (OR =1.83 (1.10 ,3.05); p = 0.021), home quarantine (OR = 2.16(1.32,3.55); p = 0.002) were associated with a higher risk of poor sleep quality. Residents with the history of
psychological and sleeping disorder such as insomnia (OR = 2.03(1.43, 2.87); p0.001),
previous anxiety and depression(OR = 1.67(1.15, 2.44); p = 0.007) were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Current anxiety was a strong independent predictor of sleep disturbance. The OR in participants with mild anxiety was 3.28 with 95%CI (2.28 ,4.73), and that in moderate and severe anxiety group was 6.09 with 95%CI (2.06 ,17.98).
It is known that anxiety as an independent symptom, is not only one of the reasons of sleep disturbance but also shares many influence factors with sleep disturbance. Our multivariate logistic regression using the same variables above indicated female gender(OR = 1.75(1.20,2.54); p= 0.004), home quarantine(OR = 2.27(1.34,3.86); p =
0.002)  previous insomnia (OR =1.82(1.24,2.68); p= 0.002) and previous
anxiety/depression(OR = 4.33(3.00,6.25); p <0.001) as predictors of current anxiety symptom during the resurge of COVID-19 in Beijing. Participants with age 55y are not likely to be anxious (OR=0.32(0.14,0.73), p=0.006).
Moreover, 793 (52.5%) participants were submitted to a nasopharyngeal swab for coronavirus, and reported no difference in sleep quality before-and-after the test. None of the participants reported having symptoms or testing positive for COVID-19.
4. Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating sleep quality and anxiety
during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the current study, the prevalence of sleep disturbance and anxiety was 49.2% and 12.2%, the former higher than reported in previous studies of the first wave[6, 7].It should be noted that our survey was conducted during the most serious period in the second wave and most of the participants are residents in Beijing. Emerging infectious diseases epidemics like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

(SARS), Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) tend to pose a negative impact on sleep quality[8, 9]. With the virus largely under control in China, a new wave of Covid-19 cases could still increase the incidence of sleep disorders in residents. Besides, the effects of the epidemic on sleep and mental health did not have geographical restrictions; a majority (78.1%) of our participants resided near the second outbreak epicenter, and did not present with more sleep disturbances and anxiety than the residents in other areas of Beijing, similarly the residents who lived in other provinces reported no lower risk of poor sleep and anxiety than Beijing residents during the second wave. A previous large cross-sectional study reported postgraduate and students who lived in Hubei province, the center of the first outbreak, had a lower risk of anxiety and depression than undergraduates and students who lived in other provinces in China during the COVID-19 epidemic[10].
Compared with the first wave of pandemic at the beginning of 2020, residents had shorter sleep duration during the second wave. However, there was no significant difference between bedtimes during the two outbreaks. Sleep duration was a mediator between exposures and mental health problems. Non-epidemic factors such as seasonal variations have been taken into account, as the first outbreak occurred in winter while the second wave broke out in summer. Natural sleep duration is shorter in the summer[11]. However shorter sleep duration may aggravate self-reported poor sleep quality and mental problems[12].
We explored the factors that could account for sleep disturbance during the second wave. We also observed that factors such as previous insomnia and anxiety-depression were significantly associated with sleep disturbance during the pandemic. Our results were consistent with previous studies in COVID-19 pandemic[13-15]. Besides traditional
factors, demographic characteristicsthe effects of control measures are discussed.
During the early outbreak, few residents had access to nucleic acid testing due to the limited availability of test kits. When Beijing's second outbreak took off, the city immediately ramped up its nucleic acid testing. City authorities conducted a staggering 2.3 million tests on residents in just 12 days[16]. More than half of participants (793,52.5%) underwent nucleic acid testing, and all cases were negative. Overturning traditional assumptions, there has been no evidence showing that mass nucleic acid testing eases anxiety and improves quality of sleep. But participants home quarantined due to travel history to a high risk area were significantly more likely to report sleep disturbance and anxiety. Nationwide surveys conducted in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic found higher prevalence of sleep problems among isolated populations[6, 17] . Although quarantines were frequently effective in protecting the public from the spread of illness, we should weigh carefully the potential benefits of mandatory mass quarantine against the possible psychological costs.
However, unlike sleep disturbance and anxiety which are often related to fear of infection at the early stage of the outbreak[18], the present study found that people paid more attention to the collapsing revenues and occupational interference during the second wave of outbreak. Strong restrictive measures to control the pandemic have been impacted the global economy significantly, including rising unemployment and reducing income worldwide[19], which could lead to sleep disturbance and depressive-anxiety disorders[20]. Interestingly, people from different occupations had similar prevalence of

sleep disturbance and anxiety symptoms, including careers deeply affected by COVID-19. In the current study, medical workers (44.2%) did not report more severe sleep disturbance. Due to China's successful control of COVID-19, the healthcare system does not seem to be overwhelmed. There have been no infections reported in medical staff during the second outbreak in Beijing, which greatly relieved anxiety and stress for healthcare workers. Besides during the second wave in Beijing, in order to prevent further spreading of COVID-19, walk-in patients had to make hospital appointments in advance. The number of hospital patients deceased than before. The workload of most non-frontline healthcare workers had been significantly reduced. Deeper cognition of COVID-19 and higher educational level in medical staff also seem to have a protective effect against anxiety and depression[21].
Anxiety is an important reason for the occurrence of sleep disorders, and also an independent symptom. It has many of the same influencing factors as sleep disorders, so we also analyzed the influencing factors for the occurrence of anxiety state in the second epidemic. After multivariate logistic regression analyses, we found that in addition to home quarantine and pre-existing insomnia, anxiety-depression symptoms appear to be significant predictors to sleep disturbance and anxiety symptoms; women and people aged under 55 years were independent predictors for anxiety. Previous studies reported females were more likely to have anxiety than men in during the SARS and COVID-19 epidemic[22-24]. Two recent web-based cross-sectional studies also demonstrated that younger subjects were at high risk of psychological problems, such as general anxiety disorder and suicidal thoughts during the COVID-19 pandemic[7, 25]. This study has several limitations. First, a cross-sectional study design during the acute pandemic stage limited the ability to determine the causal inference. The reliability of retrospective data of sleep during the early outbreak is likely to be reduced by factors such as memory loss and errors in recall. The prospective study with follow up at different stages of the pandemic can help us better understand the sleep mental health response and multi-dimensional factors. Second, online survey is a useful tool for evaluating how the general public understands and perceives a fast-moving infectious disease outbreak, however the possibility of selection bias such as occupation and age should be considered. In this study, the medical staff participants constituted a relatively high proportion, causing a deviation towards a higher degree in education. Further studies with multiple recruiting sources including traditional paper questionnaires may broaden subject participation. 5. Conclusion
This nationwide cross-sectional survey research showed poor sleep quality and anxiety are common during the second wave of COVID-19 crisis in Beijing. Residents who were home quarantined and had a previous history of insomnia and anxiety-depressive tended to have a higher risk of sleep disturbance and anxiety. Age and gender were an impacting predictors of anxiety. Prevention and control measures such as nucleic acid testing did not increase sleep disorders and anxiety.
With the increasing experience of fighting COVID-19 and mass coronavirus vaccination, we expect to bring COVID-19 under control eventually. However, the fight is still far from over, this winter a surge in COVID-19 cases occurred in China, while the

numbers continue to climb worldwide. This study may provide valuable reference to similar reemergence of the virus elsewhere in the future. It is essential to develop proper measures for mental health assessment, support, and intervention in order to reduce the negative psychological symptoms of poor sleep and anxiety for the targeted population to improve the mental health both during and after the COVID- 19 pandemic.

Abstract: Complex interactions between physical landscapes and social factors increase vulnerability to emerging infections and their sequelae. Relative vulnerability to severe illness and/or death (VSID) depends on risk and extent of exposure to a virus and underlying health susceptibility. Identifying vulnerable communities and the regions they inhabit in real time is essential for effective rapid

2
response to a new pandemic, such as COVID-19. In the period between first confirmed cases and the introduction of widespread community testing, ambulance records of suspected severe illness from COVID-19 could be used to identify vulnerable communities and regions and rapidly appraise factors that may explain VSID. We analyse the spatial distribution of more than 10,000 suspected severe COVID-19 cases using records of provisional diagnoses made by trained paramedics attending medical emergencies. We identify 13 clusters of severe illness likely related to COVID-19 occurring in the East Midlands of the UK and present an in-depth analysis of those clusters, including urban and rural dynamics, the physical characteristics of landscapes, and socio-economic conditions. Our findings suggest that the dynamics of VSID vary depending on wider geographic location. Vulnerable communities and regions occur in more deprived urban centres as well as more affluent peri-urban and rural areas. This methodology could contribute to the development of a rapid national response to support vulnerable communities during emerging pandemics in real time to save lives.
1. Introduction:
There is growing recognition in the fields of epidemiology (Lofus, 2004; Miller et al., 2012; Norris et al., 2020; Viegi et al., 2006), and urban planning (Durand et al., 2010; Northridge et al., 2003; Seo et al., 2019; Spence et al., 2020) that complex interactions between physical landscapes and social factors drive vulnerability to contagion and severe illness, and thus, understanding these mechanisms should be the focus of disease prevention and management. Urban landscapes can simultaneously influence chronic conditions associated with susceptibility to severe pathogenic illness, such as obesity by facilitating access to fast food vendors (Daras et al., 2018), and increase exposure to disease through high density urbanism (Goryakin et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016).
On March 11th, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic. Over the subsequent months, the research community has prioritised understanding contagion and transmission pathways (Park et al., 2020) as well as identifying and supporting vulnerable communities and regions (Daras et al., 2021; Khalatbari-Soltani et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2020). Vulnerable communities include those with pre-existing chronic conditions that are known to increase susceptibility to severe COVID-19 illness, such as diabetes (Peric & Stulnig, 2020) and overweight or obesity (Steinberg et al., 2020). Medical and public health research has led to widespread appreciation that the impact of the pandemic has, and continues to be, heterogenous; some communities and regions appear to be more vulnerable to severe illness than others (Marmot et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2020).
One common observation is that urban and peri-urban areas tend to be sites of high rates of infection and mortality compared to more dispersed rural areas (Stier et al., 2020). High rates of infection suggest that urban landscapes are more exposed to transmission, and, given that many cases of infection are asymptomatic or involve very mild symptoms (Kim et al., 2020), high rates of mortality may indicate that communities within those landscapes are also more susceptible to severe illness (Guilmoto et al., 2020). Characteristics of urban landscapes that are typically associated with the transmission of infectious diseases include population and employment density (Hu et al., 2013), and housing crowdedness (Low et al., 2013; Neiderud et al., 2015). However, these relationships are rapidly changing and vary depending on region and specific location within urban areas. For example, `extended urbanisation' is shifting the dynamics of vulnerability; in some cases, communities on urban peripheries may be more vulnerable than those in denser urban centres with greater access to healthcare and social support (Connolly et al., 2021). Indeed, in the case of COVID-

3
19, typical relationships between urban space and infectious disease do not consistently explain mortality, with high rates of severe cases occurring in less dense urban areas (Frank & Wali, 2021). Thus, there is a need to consider how urban landscapes influence the underlying susceptibility of communities to severe illness as well as exposure to infectious diseases.
Surprisingly, of more than 40,000 papers using clinical diagnoses of COVID-19 published in 2020, fewer than 150 have considered the implications for urban planning, and those that do tend to focus on the impact that `lockdown' has had on urban landscapes, such as pollutant rates, rather than the impact of urban landscapes on health outcomes (Sharif & Khavarian-Garmsir, 2020). In this study, we consider the relationship between built environments, exposure to emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), and susceptibility to severe COVID-19 illness provisionally diagnosed by medically trained professionals. In this context, `severe illness' refers to patients presenting with severe symptoms that require the attendance of emergency medical services.
Efforts to shield the most vulnerable communities and regions in society are more likely to be effective if they happen rapidly and in real-time (Kasda et al., 2020). Compared to other common disasters like flooding, obtaining geographically accurate data to evaluate the spatial dimensions of a pandemic, and to support vulnerable communities and regions, faces unique challenges. In the UK, the use of contact tracing and testing to identify community cases of COVID-19 commenced after the first confirmed case on January 31st, 2020. However, community testing ceased in early March as cases rose rapidly and the virus was classified as a category 3 pathogen, confining testing to level 3 laboratories. On April 2nd the UK government outlined a five-pillar strategy for expanding testing capacity including the introduction of community testing in early May, with laboratory capacity expanding rapidly over the next two months (The Health Foundation, 2020).
In the interim before laboratory capacity increased, identification of severe illness and vulnerable communities was based on individual's self-reporting of symptoms, such as via the NHS Test and Trace App, and the clinical judgement of medical professionals. Routine medical data collected within the first hour of emergency department (ED) admittance for severe illness has since been demonstrated to predict positive COVID-19 cases with a high degree of accuracy, including selfreported olfactory and taste dysfunction (OTD) (Wee, 2020; Patterson, 2020; Printza & Constantinidis, 2020) and blood oxygen levels (Soltan et al., 2021). These measures, guided by Public Health England's case definition symptom criteria (PHE, 2020) are also used by paramedic clinicians attending ambulance call outs for suspected COVID-19 cases.
Our research involves analysing records of provisional diagnoses of COVID-19 made by trained paramedics attending medical emergencies in the East Midlands of the UK. In S-1 we present a preliminary analysis comparing daily rates of suspected severe COVID-19 cases from our data set obtained from the East Midlands Ambulance NHS Trust (EMAS) to retrospective records of daily rates of cases confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for the same region. The results indicate a very strong correlation between daily rates of suspected severe cases and confirmed cases for the East Midlands region for the period examined in the current research, r=.96, p<.01, N=71. This is unsurprising given that testing in this early phase of the pandemic was largely confined to cases of severe illness, such as those patients conveyed by ambulances. Thus, ambulance records may be a reliable measure of severe COVID-19 related illness in real-time. To our knowledge, ambulance data have not previously been utilised to identify communities and regions that may be vulnerable to severe illness from COVID-19 or to investigate the social and environmental factors that may influence vulnerability. Our novel methodology presents an opportunity for health professionals to identify and support vulnerable communities who are likely to experience severe illness from a new virus in the early phase of a pandemic.

4
Ambulance records of provisional diagnosis hold several important advantages over hospital admittance records and laboratory records of confirmed cases for identifying vulnerable communities affected by severe illness. Hospitals and laboratories are required under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to aggregate patient information for reporting. Others have explored socio-economic predictors of aggregate confirmed cases in the UK at less granular scales (eg., Daras et al., 2021). However, without costly and time-consuming data linkage via NHS Digital, aggregated patient data does not allow for meaningful analysis of spatial patterns or characteristics of physical and social environments that explain geographical trends of severe illness. Ambulance data, including postcode region1, allows a more granular analysis of factors that predict severe illness from COVID-19 infection in real-time.
Our study presents a novel methodology for identifying communities and regions that are vulnerable to severe illness during the early phase of a pandemic before laboratory testing is widespread. This involves considering both risk of exposure to a contagious disease as well as underlying susceptibility to severe illness. We identify unusual clusters of provisionally diagnosed severe COVID-19 cases in real-time using medical data collated by EMAS. Provisional diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 is determined by paramedics based on observed signs, such as patient acuity, self-reported symptoms, such as OTD, and objective medical measures, such as blood oxygen levels. Our analysis explores the characteristics of communities and regions within built environments where unusual clusters occur, including landscape features and socio-economic dynamics. In this context, `unusual clusters' refers to high numbers of cases occurring within spatial proximity that are unlikely to have occurred by chance. Taken together, these analyses offer a real-time approach for identifying and protecting vulnerable communities in the critical early stages between the first confirmed case of a new EID and widespread community testing, as well as for identifying the characteristics of those communities most affected by severe illness over the course of a pandemic.
2. Conceptualising the relationship between severe suspected COVID-19 cases and built environments:
Theories about individual health and wider environments emerged in the 1980s as a critical response to medical and epidemiological paradigms; traditional medical models conceptualise health in terms of the presence or absence of biological disease, and the outcome of exposures that occur entirely at the level of the individual (Barbour, 1997). More contemporary `social' perspectives suggest that health transcends the individual and recognize the important role that social networks (Smith & Christakis, 2008) and wider social environments, including deprivation, play in health outcomes (Marmot, 1998).
Efforts to consider interactions between individual or biological factors and social factors often draw on Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theories (Eriksson et al., 2018), including his original Ecological Social Model, as well as the more recent Process-Person-Context-Time model (Rosa & Tudge, 2013). These frameworks advanced the field of public health by introducing a way to conceptualise the multi-level social interactions that influence health and wellbeing. Bronfenbrenner's models divide the social world of an individual into four `systems'; the Microsystem, including the most immediate elements of the social world, such as family, the Mesosystem, including extended social networks, the Exosystem, including wider community services, and the Macrosystem including commonly shared cultural and social beliefs and values (Bronfenbrenner, 1979).
1 UK Postcodes include two components, for example LN6 7TS. Region postcodes include the first component and the first letter of the second component; LN6 7.

5
While progressive, bioecological theories focus almost exclusively on the social world and social vulnerabilities and rarely consider landscape features that are also understood to influence health outcomes (Campbell & Wiesen, 2009; Cervero & Duncan, 2003; Williams, 2016). In contrast, in the field of urban planning, vulnerability is often conceptualised in relation to hazards and risks in the landscape, such as exposure to direct communicable disease, as well as more distal relationships, or `teleconnections' (Seto et al., 2012) between landscape features, like access to green space (De Vries et al., 2003; Markevych et al., 2017) and underlying health conditions, such as obesity (Daras et al., 2018). Importantly, exposure to a virus does not necessarily precipitate a medical emergency, rather, severe symptoms requiring emergency medical attention reflect the cumulative effect of exposure and underlying susceptibility. Thus, vulnerability is multifaceted, incorporating components of the physical landscape and components of the social world. While both bioecological and urban risk theories have advanced ways of thinking about health outcomes and pathways of vulnerability, a holistic approach is needed that considers the range of factors in built environments that precipitate severe illness and death from COVID-19.
In the case of COVID-19, the relationship between severe illness and characteristics of the built environment involves both direct and indirect pathways. On the one hand, environments can influence the direct exposure of individuals to communicable disease. On the other hand, landscape features can indirectly affect the underlying susceptibility of communities to severe symptoms, compared to experiencing mild symptoms or presenting as asymptomatic, by supporting or preventing healthy lifestyles. Features of neighbourhoods that can influence health behaviours like exercise include access to green space for passive recreation such as walking, and facilities for active exercise, such as sports grounds or leisure centres (Hartig et al., 2020). Further distance from these healthy landscape features is associated with lower levels of activity and higher risk of cardiovascular disease (Shen & Lung, 2016) and obesity (Lachowycz & Jones, 2011). However, landscape features can also reflect the social characteristics of wider living environments; high crime rates co-occur with poor physical infrastructure like housing in deprived communities. Crime can deter access to nearby outdoor spaces (Gomez et al., 2004) while poor housing indicates lower incomes and a greater likelihood of underlying chronic health conditions (Krieger & Higgins, 2002).
While deprivation broadly is associated with susceptibility to severe illness, the socio-economic characteristics of patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 have often been overlooked. Thus, Khalatbari-Soltani et al (2020) call for the systematic recording of these dynamics for identifying vulnerable groups in the early stages of a pandemic. Patel et al (2020) suggest that deprivation is likely to be associated with increased VSID from COVID-19 in three ways. Firstly, more deprived neighbourhoods often experience overcrowding which results in increased risk of infection compared to less densely populated areas. Secondly, poorer people are more likely to be employed in roles without opportunities to work from home which also increases risk of exposure. Finally, poverty is a risk factor for chronic comorbidities that in turn predict severe illness and hospitalisation from COVID-19, such as cardiovascular disease (Mehra et al., 2020), diabetes (Peric & Stulnig, 2020) and obesity (Steinberg et al., 2020).
Others have investigated the relationship between severe COVID-19 related illness and individual features of social worlds, such as deprivation (e.g., Patel et al., 2020) and physical landscapes, such as air pollution (Travaglio et al., 2021). We consider the cumulative impact of factors across demographic, socio-economic and environmental domains to explore the characteristics of vulnerable communities (Kiaghandi et al., 2020) identified spatially by unusual clusters. This approach resounds well with the underlying philosophy of bioecological modelling; health outcomes are the culmination of interactions between and within domains that make up the built

6
environment, and across individual and neighbourhood scales. Thus, in addition to social interactions, we include features of physical landscapes in our analysis to consider vulnerability across scales in Bronfenbrenner's socio-ecological landscape.
3. Methods: 3.1 Site and location The East Midlands is located in the Central Eastern part of England and spans an area of 15,627km2 (Figure 2). The estimated total population of the region is 4.8 million including the most populous urban areas of Derby, Leicester, Lincoln, Northampton and Nottingham (ONS, 2020a). The proportion of the population identifying as other than `White UK' in the East Midlands is low (14.6%) compared to the national average (20.2%) (ONS, 2020b), although some regions, including Leicester, have a much higher proportion of non-white population. In 2016, 18.5% of people in the region lived in the most deprived quintile (Public Health England, 2018). Nottingham, Derby and Leicester are the economic core of this region, with around 48% of businesses, and 50% of the population located in these cities (European Commission, 2020). The East Midlands is also the 3rd most rural region in England (European Commission, 2020).
Figure 1. Map of the UK highlighting the East Midlands region, including the locations of prominent towns and cities.
3.2 Research aims and questions The first aim of the research was to identify unusual clusters of suspected COVID-19 cases in the East Midlands of the UK using more than 10,000 records of provisional diagnoses for severe COVID-19 collated by EMAS during the first `wave' of the pandemic between March 2nd and May 11th (Kontopantelis et al., 2021). This was achieved using a Kuldorff spatial scan statistic implemented in the geospatial software SatScanTM which compares the actual distribution of cases to the predicted distribution based on population density. The null hypothesis tested is that cases are randomly

7
distributed rather than occurring in unusual clusters. The second aim of the research was to explore factors that predict cluster membership. This analysis involved computing a binary logistic regression with variables including measures of patient demographics, deprivation, and landscape features (Section 3.3). The third aim was to elucidate the individual characteristics of each unusual COVID-19 cluster, using geospatial analysis and mapping to determine the strongest predictors of cluster membership.
3.3 Measures
Table 1 summarizes the datasets and measures included in the research. Data collated by and obtained from EMAS includes provisional diagnoses of suspected COVID-19 by medically trained clinicians, age, and sex. More severe COVID-19 symptoms tend to be associated with older age (Romero et al., 2020), and mortality is nearly twice as high in males compared to females (Ortolan et al., 2020). While ethnicity is also commonly associated with severe symptoms (Sze et al., 2020), reliable data was unavailable in real-time. The diagnostic algorithm employed by medically trained clinicians is guided by Public Health England's case definition criteria (PHE, 2020), including observations of illness, self-reported symptoms like OTD, and objective medical measures like blood oxygen levels.
The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is an aggregate measure of socio-economic indictors. Low scores indicate greater deprivation while higher scores indicate greater affluence. Decile values of IMD were used for both spatial and statistical analysis. The Access to Healthy Assets and Hazardous Index (AHAHI) includes neighbourhood measures of physical landscape features, such as distance (km) from medical services and retail outlets, as well as environmental measures of air pollution which are often associated with built-up areas like dense housing, transport infrastructure and power stations (Beevers et al., 2012; Pannullo et al., 2017). The AHAHI is a validated metric that synthesises features of built environments that are commonly related to health outcomes in the wider health literature (Green et al., 2018).
According to Daras et al. (2019) healthy features of landscapes associated with more positive health outcomes include closer proximity to active and passive green space as well as health services, such as general practitioners and emergency departments. This is because physical access to health services is associated with health service use and health maintenance. Thus, we might expect to observe lower rates of suspected severe COVID-19 located nearer to the health services and healthy features of physical environments included in our analysis, such as green and blue spaces (Table 1).
Hazardous features of landscapes associated with poorer health outcomes include poor air quality, further distance from healthy features of landscapes, and closer proximity to retail vendors like fast food outlets, tobacconists, off-license stores, pubs, bars, and clubs. This is because distance from hazardous retail environments is a proxy measure for individual behaviour; people who live closer to fast food outlets are more likely to consume fast food, and subsequently to experience underlying health conditions like diabetes and obesity (Green et al., 2018). On this basis, we could anticipate that unusual clusters of suspected COVID-19 are likely to occur closer to retail vendors, further from health services and healthy physical environments, and in areas with poorer air quality. We chose to include individual measures of each of these landscape features rather than the final aggregate AHAHI scores in order to examine the effect of specific landscape scale environmental variables on COVID-19 clusters.
Raw data for AHAHI input domains (Daras et al., 2019) were used to compute the binary logistic regression analysis. Decile values were used for the purpose of geospatial analysis and mapping.

8

Given that high mortality rates have been associated with urbanity compared to rurality (Stier et al., 2020), we also included measures from the UK Rural and Urban Categories (RUC) scale to supplement our analysis of neighbourhood environments.

**only 8 categories were present in the East Midlands dataset; provisional diagnoses of COVID-19 requiring

ambulance attendance in the East Midlands were not recorded in Urban-Major Conurbations, Villages, and

Small Town and Fringe areas.

3.4 Data handling and cleaning
The database of suspected COVID-19 cases was obtained from EMAS4, including the date 999 calls were received, partial postcodes (rather than full addresses) of ambulance attendance locations, sex, and age. In total, 10,438 records were received, however, 93 records were removed because they contained errors, were missing geospatial information, or were unable to link to postcode population. All records of suspected COVID-19 cases were successfully linked to IMD, AHAHI, and RUC values. Thus, the final dataset contained 10,345 geospatial points. Only call outs for provisionally diagnosed COVID-19 were included in the dataset.
3.5 Statistical and spatial data analysis
Data analysis was conducted in three steps. Step one involved identifying unusual clusters of suspected severe COVID-19 cases by using population data as a baseline for the expected distribution of cases. For this analysis data were represented at the postcode region scale. The output included the location of statistically significant clusters, and a binary dataset distinguishing all cases that fell within clusters from all cases that fell outside of clusters. Step two involved converting the postcode region data to Lower Super Output Area scale for the purpose of linking the COVID-19

Active Green Space includes sporting areas such as playing fields and tennis courts. 3 PM, NO2 and SO2 measures are annual µg m-3, micrograms per cubic meter of air. 4 This research, including use of patient data for statistical and spatial analysis, was approved by the NHS Health Research Authority, IRAS ID: 264573.

dataset with existing national datasets, including IMD, the AHAHI, and RUC. The output was a unique linked database combining clinical and landscape scale data. In step three, statistical analyses were conducted to identify demographic, socio-economic, and environmental factors that predicted cluster and non-cluster membership, and geospatial analysis was used to characterize each individual cluster.
3.5.1 Identifying unusually high clusters of suspected COVID-19 cases
We applied a Kulldorff spatial scan statistic (Discrete Poisson model) implemented in SatScanTM software version 9.6.1 to perform the spatial analysis scanning to detect unusual clusters of COVID19 cases across the surveillance area. A spatial scan statistic is a cluster detection test that detects the location of clusters and evaluates their statistical significance (Kulldorff et al., 2005; Kulldorff, 1997). This was done by gradually scanning a window across the study area, noting the number of observed and expected observations, based on population (ONS, 2011b), inside the window at each location using a Discrete Poisson model. For any given position of the centre, the radius of the circle changes continuously so that it can take any value. For each circle, the spatial scan statistic calculates the likelihood of the observed number of cases occurring inside and outside of the circle. The circle with the maximum likelihood is the most likely cluster, and thus the least likely to have occurred by chance. This method tests the null hypothesis that cases are randomly distributed. Statistically significance suggests that unusual spatial clustering is unlikely to have occurred by chance. The isotopic circular scan method employed by the software has previously been validated for identifying clusters of other infectious disease, such as malaria (Coleman et al., 2009), HIV (Namosha et al., 2013; Tanser et al., 2017), tuberculosis (Smith et al., 2018), and various chronic diseases (Cuadros et al., 2019; Tomita et al., 2020).
The Poisson Model was purely spatial. The model parameters included unconstrained spatial cluster size, and the criteria for reporting hierarchical clusters was set to `no cluster centres in other clusters'.
3.5.2 Data conversion to LSOA and database compilation
To compile the LSOA dataset, IMD, RUC and AHAHI scores were merged using the join tool in ArcGIS Pro 2.6.0. The join used Lower Super Output Area codes (LSOA11CD) as these identifiers are consistent between the EMAS COVID-19 database and the remaining datasets. These processes are visualised in Figure 2.

10
Figure 2. Schematic of database compilation and spatial analysis including data joining, and data display as 2-D and 3-D maps using ArcGIS Pro 2.6.0. Geospatial analysis was also used to identify which cases fall into specific clusters compared to cases that are randomly distributed. In one instance, two clusters were found to overlap. However, for the purpose of characterizing clusters it was necessary to assign all cases to a single cluster. Thus, these cases (N = 54) were assigned to clusters based on their location from a centre line of intersection between the overlapping clusters. The output, a novel database, was used for regression analysis to identify factors that predict cluster membership (Section 5.2), and for geospatial analysis to produce maps representing teleconnections (Section 5.3).
3.5.3 Statistical analysis and spatial representation of significant clusters Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors that predict whether individual cases of suspected severe COVID-19 occur in unusual clusters. All measures reported in Table 3 and Table 4 were included in the regression model. While the IMD was included in the binary regression, we also conducted an ANOVA to determine whether mean differences in deprivation and affluence occur between areas with clusters and areas characterized by random distribution. In the UK, deprivation is often associated with early transmission patterns (Balasegaram et al., 2012), and high rates of contagion (Rushton et al., 2007). Thus, it is possible that deprivation is a common denominator for all areas with suspected cases of COVID-19, rather than a distinguishing feature of cluster membership. ANOVA was computed to explore more nuanced spatial differences between each cluster, and areas with cases that do not occur in clusters. Regression output and cluster output from SatScanTM was used to display the relationship between determinants of clusters visually. The cluster output from SatScanTM was converted to a layer (`cluster shapefile') within ArcGIS Pro 2.6.0. Of 41 clusters identified, 13 were statistically significant (P < 0.05). All non-significant clusters were removed from the dataset. A polygon representing the

11
East Midlands was extracted from the UK Counties 2017 shapefile (`UK shapefile') to create a background in ArcScene. Relative Risk values were assigned to each cluster within the cluster shapefile. Both the cluster shapefile and UK shapefile were converted to rasters and combined to create a unique raster displaying the Relative Risk of clusters in 3-D. The unique raster was then converted to a TIN in order to be represented clearly in ArcScene. This step addressed a display problem due to the rasters and polygons merging and warping the slope of elevation in the image. Displaying clusters involved using a scale of graduated colours from green to red that were manually selected based off the spread of the data.
4. Results: 4.1 Identifying unusually high clusters of suspected severe COVID-19 cases SatScanTM Poisson Modelling identified 13 statistically significant (P<.05) unusually high clusters of suspected COVID-19 cases, displayed in Figure 3. Per 100,000 population, the number of observed cases range from 951 West of Skegness to 3,417 East of Rugby. By comparison, the range of cases occurring per 100,000 outside of clusters was between 8 and 660. Figure 4 demonstrates the relative risk of each cluster, meaning the likelihood of contracting severe illness in an area compared to regions where cases are randomly distributed. The spatial characteristics of each cluster, including approximate location, radius, expected and observed number of cases, P-Values, specific relative risk ratios, and the number of cases in each cluster per 100,000 population are reported in Table 2.

4.2 Factors that predict cases of COVID-19 falling into unusual clusters compared to randomly distributed cases

4.2.1 Descriptive statistics

In total, 10,345 cases of suspected severe COVID-19 with sufficient information to include in analysis were reported and recorded by EMAS between March 2nd and May 11th, 2020. Of all cases, 1,123 fell into unusual clusters compared to population, while the remaining 9,222 cases were distributed randomly. The mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) for measures of IMD and AHAHI included in our analysis are presented in Table 3. The proportion of cases in unusual clusters compared to randomly distributed by sex and RUC categories are presented in Table 4.

Descriptive statistics for measures of Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), Access to Healthy Assets and Hazardous Index (AHAHI) and age for cases of severe COVID-19 in unusual clusters (M_IN, SD_IN) compared to cases randomly distributed outside clusters (M_OUT, SD_OUT). Measures of IMD are decile values. Measures of AHAH include four domains: distance (km) from retail environments, health services, physical environments, and air quality.

4.2.2 Regression analysis A binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate factors that are associated with cluster membership. Given the highly unequal distribution of cases by binary categories, the probability cutoff was set to .6, as distinct from the usual cutoff of .5 for randomly distributed binary data (Calabrese, 2014), and the model parameters were set to predict the log-odds of membership in the major category (randomly distributed cases) compared to the minor category (unusual clusters). We also performed bootstrap sampling to account for dependencies between cases in clusters. This analysis did not change the P-values or significant predictors in the regression model. The results indicate that 12 of 16 variables that input to the Access to Healthy Assets and Hazardous Index (AHAHI), and 4 rural and urban categories are significant predictors of whether cases are distributed randomly or appear in unusual clusters by population (Chi-square = 2028.36, df = 26, P = .00). Age, sex, Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) Decile, the remaining 4 AHAHI variables (Accessibility to leisure centres, gambling districts, Green Space and dentists) and 3 rural and urban categories (Urban major conurbation, Urban city and town and Rural town and fringe) are not significant. The model correctly predicted 41.3% of cases that appear in clusters and 98.7% of cases that do not appear in clusters, giving an overall percentage correct prediction rate of 92.5%5. Table 5 displays the binary logistic regression results for the independent variables that were found to be associated with cluster membership. Compared to randomly distributed cases, cases in clusters are more likely to be located closer to pubs/bars/clubs, Blue Space, off licenses, Passive Green Space, as well as in areas with higher levels of Nitrogen Oxide, and in RUC categories `urban minor conurbation', `urban city and town in sparse', `rural town and fringe', and `rural village and dispersed'. Randomly distributed cases that do not occur in clusters are located closer to tobacconists, GP practices, A&E hospitals, and pharmacies, as well as in areas with higher levels of particulate matter and Sulphur Dioxide.
5 The asymmetry in predictive accuracy for cases appearing in clusters compared to cases not appearing in clusters is a common phenomenon of highly unequal datasets (Calabrese, 2014) and reflects the true rarity of cases appearing in clusters.

4.2.3 Index of Multiple Deprivation ANOVA
Regression analysis revealed that IMD deciles was not a significant predictor of whether provisionally diagnosed severe COVID-19 cases were distributed randomly or occurred in unusual clusters. ANOVA was also computed to identify whether IMD scores varied between each individual cluster, and areas with randomly distributed cases. There was a significant difference for IMD decile scores between Cluster 1 (M = 2.93, SD = 2), Cluster 2 (M = 2.42, SD = 1.21), Cluster 3 (M = 3.22, SD = 2), Cluster 4 (M = 6, SD = 2.33), Cluster 5 (M = 7.4, SD = 2), Cluster 6 (M = 9, SD = .6), Cluster 7 (M = 3.9, SD = 2.83), Cluster 8 (M = 2.86, SD = .83), Cluster 9 (M = 8.06, SD = 1.86), Cluster 10 (M = 7.84, SD = 1.9), Cluster 11 (M = 2.49, SD = 1.04), Cluster 12 (M = 4.68, SD = 3.18), Cluster 13 (M = 5.79, SD = 2.48), and cases that are evenly distributed (M = 5.04, SD = 2.88), F(13, 10331)=40.96, p=.00.
4.3 Characteristics of unusually high severe COVID-19 clusters
The statistical analysis presented in section 5.2 considers factors related to all the clusters of suspected severe COVID-19 cases in the East Midlands. The geospatial analysis presented below considers the characteristics of individual clusters. The following series of maps (Figures 6-9) display the distribution of factors related to retail environments, health services, physical environments (including RUC), air pollution, and IMD. With the exception of RUC, all other factors are represented as deciles values.

The green spectrum indicates greater affluence and the red spectrum indicates greater deprivation. The 13 clusters of high numbers of suspected COVID-19 cases (identified using a Kulldorff spatial scan statistic) are superimposed as black circles and numbered consistent with Table 2.
Importantly, clusters displayed on the maps reflect the radius within which individual cases of suspected COVID-19 occur. To preserve the anonymity of EMAS patients, we have not displayed the specific location of cases within clusters. Table 6 synthesizes the characteristics of each individual cluster compared to areas with cases that are randomly distributed. Average scores for RUC, IMD and AHAHI have also been deidentified 6. Rather than exact values, Table 6 compares the characteristics of clusters to average values for all areas with randomly distributed cases. In some instances, the visual characteristics of a cluster may vary from the characteristics reported in Table 6. For example, Figure 9 displays the distribution of IMD scores within clusters. A cluster may appear to be predominately affluent (towards the green end of the colour scale) while most suspected COVID19 cases fall within a small area that is severely deprived (towards the red end of the colour scale). Taken together, visual and statistical analyses represent cluster characteristics accurately while maintaining the anonymity of patient locations.
6 Patient anonymity is a requirement of the approved IRAS. It may be possible to triangulate cluster information, such as radius, and specific values, such as IMD, to identify more specific locations. Our approach maintains anonymity and complies with the terms of ethical approval.

For cases that are randomly distributed by population (Non-cluster), average values for each indicator, and the average score of aggregated indictors for each domain are reported. For each cluster, a `+' sign indicates when the average score for each indicator, or average aggregated domain score, is higher than the equivalent score for `Non-cluster' cases. A `-` sign indicates when the average score is lower than the equivalent score for `Non-cluster' cases. A score of `0' indicates no difference between cluster scores and non-cluster scores.

6. Discussion:
One year into the COVID-19 pandemic research related to public health, epidemiology, and urban planning has advanced knowledge and understanding about the groups in society that are particularly vulnerable to severe illness from COVID-19. Most research about vulnerable communities and regions considers the association between COVID-19 cases and individual domains, such as deprivation or urbanisation. To our knowledge, the only prior study to use an approach similar to the methodology presented here is Kiaghandi et al. (2020) who examined the relationship between confirmed COVID-19 cases in Harris County, Texas and 46 variables across five domains, including access to health services, and environmental exposures. However, the study did not distinguish between severe illness and asymptomatic or mild cases. Further, their research used aggregate measures collated from a census to estimate the demographic characteristics of patients rather than individual records. Thus, while granular, the approach is limited for identifying communities vulnerable to severe illness and/or death. The trends identified may more accurately reflect transmission, rather than underlying susceptibility.
Severe illness from COVID-19 requiring emergency medical services reflects the intersection of exposure and underlying susceptibility. Vulnerability to severe symptoms is the outcome of complex interactions between individual demographic characteristics and community-scale socio-economic and environmental factors. Our approach, identifying and interrogating unusual clusters of severe illness from COVID-19, and investigating associations between unusual clusters and social and environmental features of landscapes offers a methodology for further supporting vulnerable communities and regions in real-time.
6.1 Identifying unusual clusters and predicting cluster membership
Our spatial analysis revealed 13 statistically significant clusters of suspected COVID-19 cases (Figure 2) with rates of severe illness ranging from 951 to 3,417 per 100,000 population. Regression analysis identified 13 factors that predict cluster membership. Overall, the predictive accuracy of our regression model is high, with lower specific accuracy for cases occurring in clusters compared to cases occurring outside of clusters. However, the proportion of cases predicted in clusters and outside of clusters are both acceptable and suggest good model fit.
Compared to the reference condition (urban towns and cities), clusters of severe illness are more likely to occur in urban minor conurbations, urban cities and towns in sparse areas, rural towns and fringe areas, and rural villages and dispersed areas. Clusters occur closer to pubs/bars/clubs, off license stores, and Passive Green Space, and further away from fast food, tobacconists, GP practices, A&E hospitals, and pharmacies. The strongest predictors of cluster membership are closer location to Passive Green Space (such as commons and wilderness areas) and higher levels of NO2. Strong associations were also found to PM10 and SO2 levels7.
Some landscape scale trends are consistent with wider literature. For example, NO2 concentrations are associated with respiratory hospital admissions more generally (Pannullo et al., 2017) as well as COVID-19 related mortality (Kiaghadi et al., 2020; Travaglio et al., 2021). Our results also provide support for other research demonstrating increased vulnerability to disease in urban areas
7 The small range of mean values for SO2 (.9-1.9 µg m-3) has almost certainly inflated the odds ratio and effect size for this pollutant. Similarly, the wide odds ratio confidence interval for SO2, compared to all other variables, suggests a high degree of uncertainty. Further, PM10 comprises numerous air pollutants, including organic matter, and has a long-range transport of thousands of kilometres (Malcom et al., 2010). The complex composition and movement of PM10 may explain the trends observed in our study, particularly in more regional and coastal areas where industrial activity and marine aerosols can contribute to concentration levels (Byrd et al., 2010).

24
compared to rural areas (Paul et al., 2020), and those further away from health services (Daras et al., 2019). Clusters 1 to 3 are entirely urban, while 10, 12, 13 and 7 are located in areas with higher than average proportions of sites in urban areas compared to non-clusters sites, and to national proportions (DEFRA, 2020).
Other findings are less consistent with assumptions about landscape teleconnections and health outcomes. The likelihood of cluster membership simultaneously increases at locations closer to off license stores and pubs/bars/clubs, but more distant from fast food venues and tobacconists. The AHAHI, and associated literature, assumes that access to all `healthy' assets promotes better health condition while access to `hazardous' assets facilitates poorer health condition (Green et al., 2018). These trends may be related to the nature of amenities and services in rural areas compared to urban areas, and may explain why some retail environments increase likelihood of cluster membership while others do no. Rural towns often contain local pubs while tobacconists and fast food venues are less common. Thus, distance from both retail outlets (more commonly found in more densely populated areas) and health services may reflect poorer access to services more generally, and thus greater vulnerability to illness (Jordan et al., 2004).
Similarly, health literature suggests that closer proximity to green space is associated with better health outcomes (Daras et al., 2018). We found that clusters are more likely to occur closer to, rather than more distant from Passive Green Space, like commons or conservation areas. This may be related to the nature of Passive, as opposed to Active green spaces. Passive Green Space like commons is likely to reflect urban periphery or rurality while Active Green Space like gymnasiums tend to be located in urban centres. The varied relationships between landscape features and vulnerability in urban compared to more regional areas, deserve more detailed consideration. For example, it is possible that closeness to Passive Green Space reflects social behaviour during the pandemic. In a perspective piece published in this Special Edition8 we examine the relationship between landscape features and the implications for COVID-19 exposure and underlying susceptibility in more depth. During extended phases of lockdown parks and arboretums became social hubs that were poorly monitored by local authorities. News reports documented continual violations of social distancing rules in public spaces like beaches and common green areas. Thus, improving the monitoring and enforcement of social distancing in these spaces may be a future avenue for mitigating high rates of severe COVID-19 cases.
Below we suggest that the balance of expected and unexpected associations between unusual clusters and landscape features reflect differences in the individual characteristics of clusters, and the nature of vulnerability between more rural and more urban landscapes.
6.3 Characteristics of individual clusters
The characteristics of clusters vary in two ways. Firstly, the degree of relative risk, and secondly in relation to wider geographic context. In order, clusters with the highest relative risk compared to the medium value were east of Rugby (5), east of the Peak District (6), south west of Derby (10), west of Grimsby (7), Leicester (2), and East Grimsby (12) (Figure 3). This analysis gives some indication of regions where communities may be particularly vulnerable.
Spatial analysis (Figure 5-9) revealed several important geographic distinctions between clusters. On this basis we classify clusters in the following categories: inland urban, rural or rural-urban mosaic,

and coastal urban (Table 7). Category One, `Inland Urban' including Nottingham, Leicester, Derby, Northampton, and Chesterfield, are predominately or entirely urban and characterized by closeness to healthy and hazardous services and beneficial physical environments. Clusters located closer to city centres (central Urban Inland: 1, 2, 3, 11) are more deprived, while clusters located in the periphery (peripheral Inland Urban: 13, 10) are more affluent. Category Two, `Rural and Mosaic' clusters in the Peak District, near Rugby, and south west of Leicester, are either entirely rural or display a rural-urban mosaic with a higher proportion of cases in rural areas compared to areas with randomly distributed cases. Rural and Mosaic clusters are characterized by further distance from healthy and hazardous services, closer proximity to beneficial physical environments, and greater affluence. Category Three, `Coastal Urban', includes clusters in predominately urban areas near Skegness and Grimsby. These clusters are characterized by deprivation, and further distance from all services and beneficial physical environments. Importantly, while each category includes clusters with higher levels of NO2, the sources are likely to vary; traffic contributes to poor air quality in large urban centres, such as Nottingham, while the operation of power plants effects air quality in more regional areas, such as the coastal Grimsby clusters.

6.4 Understanding vulnerability in the social-environmental landscape
Bioecological models suggest that health outcomes are the cumulative result of complex interactions between individual demographic and biological factors, and the social characteristics of wider environments (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Eriksson et al., 2018). Social factors may reflect both exposure to transmission of a contagious virus, (e.g. poorly designed housing estates), and underlying susceptibility related to pre-existing health conditions (Patel et al., 2020). In addition to social dynamics, our analysis included physical characteristics of the built environment that may explain vulnerability to severe symptoms of infectious disease, such as distance from green space (Green et al., 2018).
Our analysis suggests that unusual clusters occur at the nexus of individual susceptibility and exposures in the built environment. However, the dynamics of vulnerability vary between geographic locations. For example, Inland Urban clusters are located closer to all services while Coastal Urban clusters are located further from all services. Except Peripheral Inland Clusters, these regions are more deprived than areas with cases occurring randomly. Thus, the cumulative effect of exposure in high density urban areas and susceptibility associated with deprivation may be more

26
important determinants of vulnerability than distance from specific healthy and hazardous features of built environments.
The characteristics of clusters in more affluent areas, including two with very high relative risk (10, 6) suggests that the dynamics of vulnerability vary markedly from clusters in poorer regions. Firstly, affluent clusters tend to be in more regional locations including urban peripheries and rural areas which are typically occupied by older communities (ONS, 2020c). In the U.S., rural communities with high rates of severe COVID-19 symptoms are characterised by aging populations and greater distance from health services (Lakhani et al., 2020). Similar characteristics may explain high relative risk in more peripheral and rural clusters in the East Midlands. With one exception (Skegness), the average age of patients located in the Peripheral Inner Urban clusters is higher than all other clusters, and Rural and Mosaic clusters are located further from health services. These dynamics indicate a `rural paradox'; lower risk of transmission, greater susceptibility to severe symptoms, and less access to the medical services required to meet the needs of susceptible communities. Taken together, these observations suggest that the relative contribution of demographic, socio-economic, and environmental factors to vulnerability varies depending on wider geographic location. Factors that influence underlying health susceptibility, like older age and distance from health services, may be stronger predictors of severe illness than socio-economic status in regional locations that are less exposed to transmission risks. In contrast, deprivation and high-density urbanism may outweigh the benefits of closeness to, or distance from, physical features of the built environment. In these cases, it is likely that susceptibility related to deprivation, and exposure related to urbanization, are more powerful drivers of overall vulnerability than access to health services or retail outlets.
Similar to closeness to passive green spaces discussed above, our findings about vulnerability in rural areas suggest some policy responses for future pandemics and phases of lockdown. News reporting during the first national phase of lockdown suggests that the public viewed rural areas as less vulnerable to contagion and mortality related to COVID-19 compared to urban areas (e.g., McCarthy, 2020). Further, rural communities reported the phenomenon of people from urban and peri-urban areas `flocking' to rural regions for recreation during phases of lockdown when only essential travel was legally permitted (Asquith, 2020). In the event of future phases of lockdown, mitigating high rates of severe illness in rural areas with aging populations may require more stringent policing of travel between urban and rural areas.
In summary, factors and processes that explain vulnerability to severe COVID-19 illness and or death are complex and highly location-specific. Bioecological models traditionally focus on the interaction between complex social systems while urban theories emphasise distal associations within physical environmental landscapes. We suggest that social and physical landscape factors rightly belong in a theoretical space akin to Bronfenbrenner's Mesosystem, which includes processes and interactions that occur within homes, communities, and neighbourhoods (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). Figure 11 visualises what this Mesosystem might look like.

27
Figure 11. Schematic showing the social-environmental Mesosphere demonstrating the multi-level factors associated with severe illness from COVID-19. The dotted arrow indicates the interaction between socio-economic factors and physical landscape factors within the Mesosphere. The granularity of our analysis, facilitated by the high resolution of the data, offers some important insights for supporting the most vulnerable communities in real-time during the early phase of a pandemic when laboratory testing is limited and public policy is informed by cases in the community. In the case of COVID-19, those vulnerable communities include deprived urban neighbourhoods and more affluent regional neighbourhoods. 6.5 Strengths and limitations There are three limitations of the research. Firstly, big data does not capture individual behaviour; distance from green space and other amenities does not reflect use. Secondly, factors beyond the scope and scale of this research may affect ambulance use. People within close proximity to hospitals with A&E services are more likely to access those services directly rather than calling an ambulance. Similarly, willingness to call an ambulance may vary between communities. Poor health literacy, including ability to recognize symptoms of illness, is often associated with deprivation (Niksic et al., 2015). As a result, it is likely that our data does not represent all severe cases of suspected COVID-19 in the study region. Thus, qualitative community scale research is needed to ground truth the trends and associations reported here. Finally, without data linkage, suspected COVID-19 cases cannot be confirmed. However, the preliminary diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 is based on the assessment of trained medical professionals following the guidelines and algorithms that were widely employed by medical services in the early phases of the pandemic before rapid testing was available. Further, measures taken by ambulance paramedics, including blood oxygen levels (Soltan et al., 2021) and self-reported OTD (Wee, 2020; Patterson, 2020; Printza & Constantinidis, 2020), have been demonstrated to predict positive cases with a high degree of accuracy. The need for rapid response is paramount. The spatial accuracy of our approach, using a novel routinely collated dataset demonstrates a methodology for identifying vulnerable communities in real-time, as well as understanding the demographic, socio-economic, and environmental characteristics of vulnerability across dynamic geographic landscapes.

7. Conclusions:
Vulnerability to severe illness from contagious disease occurs at the intersection of exposure and underlying susceptibility. The effect of biological, social, and environmental risk factors is cumulative. Thus, single characteristics of built environments like deprivation or air pollution do not explain severe symptoms that require emergency medical attention. Our analysis builds on advancements in public health, epidemiology and urban planning by integrating features of the built environment with more traditional bioecological frameworks that tend to focus on complex social interactions.
The analysis of ambulance attendance data for monitoring the progress of the pandemic is a novel approach in the UK, and to our knowledge, has not been used to identify clusters of COVID-19 elsewhere. We acknowledge that analysing suspected COVID-19 cases is an imperfect science. However, we offer some insights that may be of benefit for rapid response as well as longer-term urban planning:
 Joining ambulance data to publicly available big datasets like the IMD and AHAHI could identify vulnerable communities in real-time;
 Understanding the social and environmental characteristics of vulnerability may help policy makers to mitigate the impact of a new EID on communities;
 Identifying vulnerable communities in real-time could inform earlier localised lockdowns to mitigate transmission and reduce rates of severe illness. Targeting areas where contagion is likely to result in high rates of hospitalisation would also reduce burden on emergency medical services;
 Opportunities for mitigating transmission also include more effective monitoring and enforcement of social distancing rules in Passive Green Space, including parks, commons and arboretums, as well as for urban-rural travel during lockdown;
 The dynamics of vulnerability vary between urban centres and more peripheral or rural regions, and between more deprived compared to more affluent communities. The opportunities for minimising the impacts of a pandemic include reducing the underlying susceptibility of communities as well as minimising transmission. In part, this involves urban planning to enhance opportunities for health behaviours. Improving the safety of green spaces for cost-free exercise, and increasing infrastructural and financial access to healthy food would promote healthier lifestyles in deprived communities. Further, improving access to health services in more affluent and isolated communities may help to mitigate the most severe outcomes of a pandemic. However, in both cases this requires top-down financial investment to encourage healthy retail outlets to locate in deprived neighbourhoods, and health services to locate in low-density neighbourhoods.
At the time of writing, twelve months has elapsed since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the introduction of national responses to contain transmission. Some approaches have proven more successful than others. Identifying unusual clusters of suspected COVID-19 cases and the factors that predict the location of clusters offers a way forward for the UK to adopt more targeted physical distancing approaches that have been effective for preventing further outbreaks and reducing the economic burden of nation-wide lockdown elsewhere. Unequal health outcomes and severe illness in the UK reflects decades of systemic disadvantage and accumulated vulnerability (Marmot et al., 2020). Addressing underlying susceptibility will require long-term investment in areas including neighbourhood quality, educational attainment, and closing income gaps. Mitigating the impact of future pandemics necessarily involves `levelling up' health across the UK, including between rural and urban spaces, coastal and inland spaces, and deprived and affluent communities.

29
As a global society, we have entered an indeterminate phase of uncertainty and trial-and-error in combating the pandemic. In the wake of the most immediate threat to human life, policy makers face the challenge of redefining the relationship between societies and their urban habitats. Utilizing big-data to identify hot-spots of vulnerability could be used as a method to inform current mitigation policy, as well as longer-term transitions towards healthier urban landscapes.

Highlights:
 Air quality and features of urban landscapes are risk factors for COVID-19.  Deprived areas face different challenges for mitigating contagion compared to affluent
areas.  Identifying clusters of COVID-19 transmission could be used to inform `isolate, test, trace'.  Ambulance calls reflect acute cases of COVID-19 and could be used for pre-hospital triage.  Factors that are associated with clusters are highly location specific.

Abstract Patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatments have a higher need for protection against coronavirus disease (COVID19) that follows infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus but their ability to respond sufficiently to COVID vaccines is uncertain. We retrospectively evaluated SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit 1 (S1)-specific antibody levels after two mRNA doses in 242 patients with underlying chronic inflammatory, hematooncological or metabolic diseases and in solid organ transplant recipients. S1specific antibodies were measured 30 days after the second dose. In 15.9% of these patients, no S1-specific antibodies were detectable. Nonresponsiveness was linked to administration of B-cell depleting therapies as well as to ongoing therapies that block lymphocyte trafficking (Fingolimod) or inhibit T cell proliferation (Tacrolimus). Thus, it is important to inform immunosuppressed patients about the risk of vaccine non-responsiveness and the necessity to maintain non-pharmaceutical protection measures. In these risk patients antibody testing and cellular analysis are helpful to estimate the benefit/responsiveness to further booster vaccinations.
COVID19 mRNA vaccines consist of a lipid nanoparticle-formulated nucleosidemodified mRNA which encodes for the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 1. In fully vaccinated healthy individuals, mRNA vaccines induce a robust anti-spike antibody response resulting in ~95% efficacy against COVID19 1. Considering the extent of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, such observations on vaccine efficacy in healthy individuals were of utmost importance, but information on efficacy in vulnerable populations has been largely lacking 2. We wondered whether treatments known to directly reduce B-cell numbers or impair T-lymphocyte function would inhibit vaccine-induced antibody production.

Thus, we performed a retrospective study of S1-antibody production following mRNA vaccination in patients undergoing various immunosuppressive treatment regimens. We analysed S1-specific antibody results in a total of 214 patients (117 females, 97 males; mean age: 53. 4 (51.4-55.4 95%CI) at our outpatient vaccination clinic for highrisk patients after intramuscular administration of two doses BNT162b2 (PfizerBioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna). Both vaccines contain mRNA encoding for the spike protein in lipid nanoparticles that were administered into the deltoid muscle with no other vaccines administered concomitantly. Among these were patients suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases (including rheumatoid arthritis, intestinal bowel disease or multiple sclerosis; n=104), hematooncological diseases (n=66), solid tumors (n=14), patients with solid organ transplants (n=22) or metabolic disorders (n=8) Additionally, antibody results from 26 healthy individuals (50% females; mean age: 48.7 (41.5-55.9 95%CI) served as controls. S1-specific IgG titers were assessed by ELISA (Quantivac®, Euroimmune) following the manufacturer's instructions at an average of 31.7 (30.2-33.3 95%CI) days after the second dose. We included test results received between January 2021 and June 23rd 2021. Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna (EK 1586/2021). In our study population, we were able to evaluate baseline S1-specific antibody titers prior to the first dose in 89.1% (/214) of patients. Of those 1.05% (n=2) were positive and 0.52% (n=1) was in borderline range already before receiving the first dose of an mRNA vaccine indicating a prior asymptomatic infection. After the two dose vaccination schedule we observed that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were undetectable (i.e.< 25.6 BAU/ml) in 15.89% (34/214; mean age 56.3 (50.7-61.9 95%CI); 58.8% females) of the mentioned entity of patients(Figure 1; Table 1). Borderline titer results (i.e. 25.6-35.2 BAU/ml) according to the manufacturer´s

reference values were obtained in 2.8% (6/214; mean age 64.9 (53.6-76.3 95%CI); 16.7% females; Figure 1, Table 2) of patients and positive antibody results were received in 81.31% (n=174; mean age) of patients. In contrast, among the healthy individuals, that had requested an antibody titer measurement, all (n=26) had positive antibody titer (i.e. >35.2 BAU/ml) results after two doses of the mRNA vaccines. Furthermore, geometric mean titers were significantly higher in the healthy individuals compared to the seropositive patients (GMT 706.7 versus 517.1; p<0.05, Students ttest). With regard to non-responsiveness, further analysis showed that a lack of antibody production was preferentially linked to an ongoing treatment with Rituximab in patients with B-cell malignancies or autoimmune disorders, Fingolimod in patients with multiple sclerosis or Calcineurine inhibitors (Tacrolimus) in renal transplant patients (Table 1). Due to the retrospective character of this study B and T cell counts are not available from all study participants, However, among 13 non-responders B and T cell counts between 34 days before and up to 115 days after the first mRNA dose were available and revealed that none of them showed normal B cell counts according to the reference values, irrespective of the type of immunosuppressive therapies (Figure 2). Part of these patients displayed CD4+ T cell counts in normal range, however, we do not have further information on the functionality of these cells. It is proposed that various mechanisms seem to be involved in the inability to mount an antibody response which include B cell depletion (< 1%) by Rituximab3, prevention of lymphocyte trafficking from lymphoid tissue by Fingolimod4 or inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation by Tacrolimus5 thereby hindering also T-cell help for B-cell antibody production. The Rituximabinduced defect in antibody production persisted for at least 11 months after the termination of treatment and was normalized only after this period resulting in an antibody response in 4 out of 14 Rituximab-treated patients. Of note, two patients with

the last Rituximab administration longer than 11 months ago were still not able to mount an antibody response and remained seronegative, indicating individual recovery rates after this treatment. Recent data now show that part of these B cell depleted patients and also other immunosuppressed patients are able to mount a cellular response to the COVID19 vaccine 6-9.. In the group of responders, the underlying treatment regimens were diverse (Figure 3). The data further show that 2 out of 8 patients on Fingolimod were able to mount an antibody response. In SOT patients, particularly kidney-transplanted patients (as well as one with a heart and one with a liver transplant on Tacrolimus) did not show any antibody responses, whereas the other SOT patients - even when treated with Tacrolimus - mounted S1-specific antibody levels. This illustrates that immune responsiveness/non-responsiveness cannot easily be predicted in patients with highgrade immunosuppressive treatments, and therefore immunologic testing of antibodies and cellular responses may help to anticipate vaccine-responsiveness. We conclude that both, patients undergoing such immunosuppressive treatments and physicians prescribing these therapies should be informed about the potential lack of anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody formation following vaccination. Patients with the mentioned diseases and treatments need counseling for alternative protection methods including social distancing, use of masks and - most importantly - the inclusion of their immediate contacts into vaccination programs. However, also in patients mounting an immune response, one should be aware of the fact that antibody titers are often lower than in the healthy population and it is necessary to follow the kinetics of these antibody levels over time as they may wane more quickly in the immunosuppressed. Application of additional vaccine doses seem justified if an immune response at least at the cellular level can be expected and has been shown promising in SOT patients to increase seroconversion rates and antibody levels 10,11.

Importantly, these doses should be discussed in relation to lymphocyte typing results, and whenever applicable, by lymphocyte functionality tests as well as monitoring of humoral and cellular responses. Wherever feasible, the timing of the booster application should be planned to utilize therapeutic cycles/intervals with lower immunosuppressive drug levels.

ABSTRACT
Research on automated social media rumour verification, the task of identifying the veracity of questionable information circulating on social media, has yielded neural models achieving high performance, with accuracy scores that often exceed 90%. However, none of these studies focus on the real-world generalisability of the proposed approaches, that is whether the models perform well on datasets other than those on which they were initially trained and tested. In this work we aim to fill this gap by assessing the generalisability of top performing neural rumour verification models covering a range of different architectures from the perspectives of both topic and temporal robustness. For a more complete evaluation of generalisability, we collect and release COVID-RV, a novel dataset of Twitter conversations revolving around COVID19 rumours. Unlike other existing COVID-19 datasets, our COVID-RV contains conversations around rumours that follow the format of prominent rumour verification benchmarks, while being different from them in terms of topic and time scale, thus allowing better assessment of the temporal robustness of the models. We evaluate model performance on COVID-RV and three popular rumour verification datasets to understand limitations and advantages of different model architectures, training datasets and evaluation scenarios. We find a dramatic drop in performance when testing models on a different dataset from that used for training. Further, we evaluate the ability of models to generalise in a few-shot learning setup, as well as when word embeddings are updated with the vocabulary of a new, unseen rumour. Drawing upon our experiments we discuss challenges and make recommendations for future research directions in addressing this important problem.

1. Introduction
1.1. Automated misinformation detection
The proliferation of misinformation on social media poses a serious threat to the functioning of society and the health and wellbeing of its citizens (Islam, et al., 2020). This issue has motivated efforts by fact checkers, journalists, social media platforms and researchers to develop ways to identify and debunk misinformation so as to mitigate its impact (Graves & Mantzarlis, 2020; Karafillakis, Van Damme, Hendrickx, & Larson, 2022; Shu, et al., 2020). A range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been developed to address the challenges of identifying the veracity of content circulating on social media. A usual first step

is rumour detection, which consists in distinguishing check-worthy, widely spreading, unverified claims (rumours) from other kinds of content in social media posts (non-rumours) (Zubiaga, Aker, Bontcheva, Liakata, & Procter, 2018). Next, rumour verification characterises a rumour as True, False or Unverified, given a conversation thread, which consists of a sequence of posts discussing the rumour, linked through a reply relationship. Often rumour detection and rumour verification are operationalised as a single, combined, 4-way classification task.1

1.2. Motivation for generalisability study

In recent years a significant body of work has shown that utilising aspects of conversations around rumours such as structure of the conversation, and/or stance expressed in the responses when developing social media rumour verification models leads to important improvements in performance (Dougrez-Lewis, Liakata, Kochkina, & He, 2021; Huang, Zhou, Wu, Wang, & Wang, 2019; Khoo, Chieu, Qian, & Jiang, 2020; Kochkina, Liakata, & Zubiaga, 2018). In fact, some of these models achieve accuracy scores above 90% (Bian, et al., 2020; Huang, Yu, Wu, & Wang, 2020; Yuan, Ma, Zhou, Han, & Hu, 2019); However, these high performance scores may have been overstated as they have not been tested across datasets. Testing on a different dataset from the one used for training is a more realistic way to evaluate model robustness and generalisability (Marasovi, 2018). Generalisability is increasingly becoming an important factor within NLP research, as is evident in recent work across different tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis (Moore & Rayson, 2018) and hate speech detection (Yin & Zubiaga, 2021). Despite the real-world importance of rumour verification as a task and the need for models to be able to apply to unseen rumours to be effective (Lukasik, et al., 2019), model generalisability in this area remains unexplored. New rumours always introduce unseen topics, thus leading to the usage of different vocabulary and new social media users contributing to them in distinctive ways. This poses a major challenge to model generalisability. However, social media rumour verification models are built on the hypothesis that conversations around rumours follow similar patterns across events and datasets, such as common stance and propagation patterns. Indeed, the existence of such patterns has been demonstrated in earlier work (Zubiaga, Liakata, Procter, Hoi, & Tolmie, 2016) and has been exploited to improve performance on veracity assessment (Dougrez-Lewis et al., 2021; Kochkina et al., 2018; Kumar & Carley, 2019). As a result one would expect that models that capture such patterns will be less susceptible to changes in vocabulary. When rumour verification models fail to generalise it is therefore not clear if they are mostly affected by a change in vocabulary, inability to exploit generic patterns of conversations around rumours or the lack of such patterns in some types of rumours. This makes the study of rumour verification model generalisability particularly interesting and challenging. Understanding the extent or the lack of model generalisability will help inform limitations of current approaches and identify future research directions to improve the state-of-the-art.

1.3. Our work

In this work we assess and analyse the ability of several top-performing rumour verification models to generalise to unseen rumours and events from the perspectives of both topic and temporal robustness. Our focus here is on rumour verification leveraging conversational threads discussing the rumours, following a line of research that has been widely studied in recent years (Bian, et al., 2020; Gao, Han, Song, & Ciravegna, 2020; Khoo et al., 2020).
To enable an up to date evaluation of generalisability across time, we also collect and release a novel dataset containing social media conversations around rumours involving COVID-19, a topic that sparked a high volume of posts and controversy (Pian, Chi, & Ma, 2021). Despite numerous efforts at producing COVID-19 misinformation datasets (Cui & Lee, 2020; Hossain, et al., 2020; Zhou, Mulay, Ferrara, & Zafarani, 2020), existing datasets do not contain conversations around rumours, along with their associated thread structures. They contain claims (Dharawat, Lourentzou, Morales, & Zhai, 2020), tweets (Hossain, et al., 2020), news headlines (Cui & Lee, 2020) and scientific publications (Wang, Lo, et al., 2020). The absence of social media conversations in these datasets currently prevents evaluation of verification models operating on the conversation structure (Bian, et al., 2020; Ma, Gao, & Wong, 2018). Following the structure and format of the PHEME and Twitter15/16 datasets, we therefore collect and release a novel, carefully curated dataset of rumours and corresponding Twitter conversations discussing them, which we use to evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art rumour verification models.

1.4. Research questions

In evaluating generalisability of social media rumour verification models we are interested both in the performance gap when operating across datasets and also, importantly, in understanding what aspects of models and datasets affect this, so that verification techniques developed in future work may leverage these findings.
Specifically, we address the following research questions:
· RQ1: How well can rumour verification models generalise to unseen rumours across datasets from similar time periods and those more distant in time?
· RQ2: If the models experience performance drop on unseen datasets, will the ranking of model performance evaluated across datasets align with the ranking of these models when evaluated within one dataset?

1 In this work we consider social media rumour verification as a standalone, 3-class classification problem as well as its combination with rumour detection into a 4-class problem; for brevity we will refer to both as rumour verification.

· RQ3: Which models or groups of models show better generalisability? · RQ4: Which training datasets lead to better model generalisability? Does increasing the size of the training data improve
generalisability? · RQ5: Which data properties are related to performance drop? · RQ6: Does the evaluation strategy used on the original training dataset play a role in training more generalisable models or
estimating their future performance more realistically? · RQ7 : How receptive are different models to strategies such as few-shot learning and using embeddings updated with data from
a new rumour?

1.5. Contributions

We make the following contributions:
· We are the first to test generalisability of top performing rumour verification models across datasets in two settings: (1) between datasets from the same time period; and (2) on test data collected at a later time period. We show that rumour verification models fail to generalise, with a sizeable performance drop when applied across datasets for all models.
· We provide extensive analysis of similarities and differences in model performance for five different models in several training settings.
· We release COVID-RV, a novel COVID-19 dataset of false claims and corresponding Twitter conversations to facilitate generalisability analysis.
· We investigate the difference in vocabulary between datasets and find that with the rise in distance between vocabularies we observe a higher performance drop.
· We discuss challenges and provide suggestions on ways to improve the generalisability of verification models.

2. Related work

In this section we describe the landscape of relevant works on rumour verification in terms of models and benchmark datasets, as well as novel datasets focusing specifically on COVID-19 rumours, and discuss how our work fits within the model generalisability domain.

2.1. Rumour verification models

Automated social media rumour verification is an active research area in NLP. Models have achieved high performance by leveraging linguistic, network- and user-related features (Chen, Zhou, Zhang, & Bonsangue, 2021; Kumari, Ashok, Ghosal, & Ekbal, 2022; Li, Fan, Yuan, & Zhang, 2022), propagation patterns, stance of the responses and conversation structures (Bian, et al., 2020; Dougrez-Lewis et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2018). Generalisability to new, unseen rumours is a crucial requirement for these models to be useful in real world settings. The fact that each new rumour introduces a new topic associated, which may be linked with fast-paced, ongoing and new real-life events, and attract discussions from diverse groups of individuals, makes this a challenging task and a problem inherent to rumour verification. Social media rumour verification models aim to resolve rumours at an early stage, and so they cannot always rely on the availability of confirmation from a specific, reliable source to determine their veracity (unlike the setup in Hossain, et al. (2020)). Thus, these models have to find generalisable signals among linguistic, network- and user-related features of Twitter conversations, rather that memorise information from the training set. Twitter15, Twitter16 (Ma, Gao, & Wong, 2017) and PHEME (Kochkina et al., 2018; Zubiaga, et al., 2016) are widely-used benchmark datasets for the tasks of rumour detection and verification. Many of the proposed models achieve high accuracy, such as 88% on Twitter15 in Bian, et al. (2020), 85% in Khoo et al. (2020), and 90.5% in Yuan, et al. (2019). This outperforms the performance of a non-professional human annotator on this task, which was estimated at around 60-65% in Kochkina et al. (2018). Every year, new approaches advancing the state-of-the-art performance appear, however, the question on how ready these are for application in a real-world setting remains unexplored. Papers proposing rumour verification models generally focus just on either Twitter15, Twitter16 (Huang et al., 2020; Huang, et al., 2019; Tu, et al., 2021; Wakamiya & Aramaki, 2020; Yuan, et al., 2019; Zhang, Cook, & Yilmaz, 2021) or PHEME (Kumar & Carley, 2019; Lee, et al., 2021; Roy, Bhanu, Saxena, Dandapat, & Chandra, 2022), with few papers using all three datasets (Khoo et al., 2020; Kochkina & Liakata, 2020) but still evaluating performance on each dataset separately. Ni, Li, and Kao (2021) perform cross-dataset performance comparison for several rumour datasets but their work is limited to a single BERT model operating on individual tweets. Furthermore, the work is limited to a binary classification setup, and the paper confuses the label definitions in the tasks, e.g. they perform rumour detection on PHEME using only rumour-non-rumour labels (meaning check-worthiness rather than veracity), but they are actually using veracity labels `True' and `False' from Twitter 15 and Twitter 16. Hence, we are the first to evaluate generalisability of a selection of top performing models across these popular datasets and also on a novel dataset of Twitter rumour conversations that is distant in time from the training data.2 We expect a reasonable level of

2 We note that separating domain/topic and temporal generalisability is not feasible in this case (unlike other tasks like sentiment analysis or stance classification) as new, unseen rumours appearing at a later date always concern new topics.

generalisability across the Twitter15/16 and PHEME datasets because data were collected around the same time period and share some of the topics. Generalisability to new rumours is currently addressed by using Leave-One-Event-Out (LOEO) cross-validation (CV) evaluation in the PHEME dataset. It has been shown that the performance difference between LOEO CV and random split CV is sizeable, and can reach around 38% (Khoo et al., 2020; Kochkina et al., 2018). Similarly, Zhang, Cao, et al. (2021) used temporal splits on the Weibo dataset (dataset of rumour conversations in Chinese from the Weibo microblog platform). However, temporal or event level splits are not addressed in research using the Twitter15/16 datasets. Thus, we hypothesise that due to the more strict LOEO CV evaluation, performance on PHEME is less likely to be overestimated than on Twitter15/16.

2.2. Generalisability

Generalisability is the capacity of a model to perform well on new, unseen data. Models are often evaluated on the test set with the assumption that future cases come from the same distribution as the training data. However, various NLP studies have reported a lack of generalisability among state-of-the-art models when tested on out-of-distribution data (Ettinger, Rao, Daumé, & Bender, 2017; Thakur, Reimers, Rücklé, Srivastava, & Gurevych, 2021), e.g., for hate speech (Yin & Zubiaga, 2021) and sentiment analysis (Moore & Rayson, 2018). Furthermore, recent studies (Alkhalifa, Kochkina, & Zubiaga, 2021; Röttger & Pierrehumbert, 2021) raise the issue of temporal robustness, i.e. performance drops when models are evaluated on data from the same domain but distant in time. This draws attention to the importance of generalisability and reveals domain-specific reasons for the lack of generalisability to inform future research.
To fulfil their purpose in the real-world, rumour verification models need to be able to deal with the constant growth in and evolution of rumours. However, existing research has not assessed the generalisability of rumour verification models. We fill this gap by evaluating the generalisability of rumour verification models across datasets, within a similar time period (between PHEME and Twitter15, Twitter16) and distant in time (testing on COVID-RV).
Domain adaptation (DA) and domain generalisation (DG) focus on models that learn from one or several different but related domains that will generalise well on unseen testing domains. In DA one can leverage unlabelled target information, but this is not the case for DG. Ramponi and Plank (2020) and Wang, et al. (2021) provide comprehensive recent surveys of DA and DG areas. One important point that Ramponi and Plank (2020) highlight is that there is no common ground on what constitutes a domain in NLP. For example, in the case of social media rumour verification, we could call each new rumour a new domain; or we could aggregate rumours into larger groups such as politics, celebrity or football, and treat these groups as domains; another option yet would be to treat the source of the data (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, News) or even each individual user as a domain.
Thus, in this paper, we do not consider generalisability of rumour verification models to be strictly a domain adaptation or domain generalisation problem. Rumours are always concerned with new, unexpected topics and events of various scales, and thus rumour verification models are designed and trained to identify features that are common/inherent to rumours or misinformation (such as writing style, stance and propagation patterns). These are expected to perform well across different topics and events. Depending on one's perspective of what constitutes a domain (e.g., each rumour or Twitter overall) we may or may not need to perform domain adaptation. Furthermore, as we are unable to foretell the topics of future rumours, we are also unable to accurately predict the scale of events that trigger rumours and the degree of their propagation. Therefore, it is impossible to tell whether new unsupervised event/rumour data will be accessible in time to support rumour resolution, and it is unclear whether DA or DG methodologies should be applied. Thus, contributing to DA or DG methodology is out of the scope of the current paper. Instead our goal is to evaluate the extent of generalisability of SOTA rumour verification models and what could be future fruitful avenues of research to improve it. While we study two setups from DA that can improve generalisability (few-shot learning and updated word embeddings), these have been chosen to serve as a baseline for future work in this direction.
In addition to providing a much needed generalisability investigation of rumour verification models,3 we cater for multiple training data setups and compare leave-one-event-out with random cross-validation splits as evaluation approaches. This is in line with Wang, et al. (2021) and Zhou, Elfardy, Christodoulopoulos, Butler, and Bansal (2021) who stress the importance of train data quality and diversity, as well as the importance of evaluation setups, where the testing domain is unseen during training, such as leave one-domain-out cross-validation.
Another important question is what has a more significant effect on the generalisability of a rumour verification system: choice of model architecture or choice of training dataset. Gröndahl, Pajola, Juuti, Conti, and Asokan (2018) evaluate crossdataset performance of hate speech detection models and report that for successful hate speech detection, model architecture is less important than the type of data and labelling criteria. This is somewhat expected as in their study different datasets include different types of hate speech, such as racist, sexist, offensive; furthermore, the notion of hate and offensive speech has a subjectivity component. Unlike Gröndahl, et al. (2018), we use datasets that have a consistent definition of a rumour and the verification process is arguably less subjective than that of identifying hate speech. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether the influence of the model architecture or the training data will be more significant, and we investigate this in this study.

2.3. COVID-19 datasets

The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a so-called misinfodemic: the wide spread of rumours and conspiracy theories about the coronavirus. To address this, the scientific community has been collecting datasets of true and false information on this

3 Ramponi and Plank (2020) point out the over-representation of sentiment analysis task in generalisability studies and the need for other tasks to be addressed.

Poynter, FakeCOVID (Shahi & Nandini, 2020) and PANACEA (Arana-Catania, et al., 2022) datasets focus on collecting fact-checked claims about COVID-19, rather than related social media posts. CheckThat! 2020 (Shaar, et al., 2020), ReCOVery (Zhou et al., 2020), CMU-MisCOV19 (Memon & Carley, 2020), and COVID-19-Stance (Glandt, et al., 2021), while addressing relevant tasks, do not provide or focus on veracity annotations. Datasets such as COAID (Cui & Lee, 2020) and MM-COVID (Li et al., 2020) (also COVIDHERA (Dharawat et al., 2020) as a subset of COAID) are collected and/or annotated using automated means (fully or partially) and contain potential noise in labels when matching between rumourous claims and social media content, and/or duplicate claims. One of the main distinctive properties of our dataset compared to those listed above is that it is carefully curated and manually annotated in two stages.
Our dataset COVID-RV (Section 3) extends CovidLies (Hossain, et al., 2020) by associating social media conversations with claims in CovidLies. The set of claims has been further refined compared to CovidLies to remove time-dependent, multi-part, ambiguous and duplicate claims. Furthermore, unlike other datasets, which either use individual posts (Dharawat et al., 2020; Hossain, et al., 2020; Hou et al., 2022; Shaar, et al., 2020) or do not provide the connections between posts (Cheng, et al., 2021), in our new dataset we focus on finding relevant tweets that are sources of conversations around a rumour and then collect the relevant conversations, which are then used in rumour verification models. The conversations in COVID-RV are of the same type as those in PHEME (Zubiaga, et al., 2016) and Twitter15, Twitter 16 (Ma et al., 2017), which led to the creation of a plethora of automated verification models (see Section 2.1), the robustness of which we test in Sections 4 and 5. It is also worth noting that our dataset covers a wider time period than the above-mentioned prior datasets, that is, between January and November 2020.

3. Creating the COVID-RV dataset

In this section we describe the creation process of the COVID-RV (COVID-Rumour Verification) dataset, which consists of: (1) matching claims to tweets; (2) relevance annotation; (3) stance annotation; and (4) collecting conversation threads.
Claim-tweet matching We start with a set of 62 false claims (misconceptions) about COVID-19 refined from CovidLies (Hossain, et al., 2020). The claims in CovidLies were sourced from Wikipedia and manually re-written to be a positive expression of a misconception.5 Claims pertaining to the actions of particular political parties, governments, religious groups, or ethnicities were removed as these do not usually pertain to the topic of the COVID-19 pandemic but rather events happening during the same time period; claims referring to photos or videos (multi-modal) were also removed, as they require different approaches to verification, which involve taking other modalities into account. Compound claims were split into atomic ones, some claims were corrected and some edited for brevity and duplicate claims were removed (see Appendix A).
We use the COVID-19-TweetIDs collection (Chen, et al., 2020) to identify tweets matching the 62 claims so as to collect associated tweet threads. In line with previous work (Zubiaga, et al., 2016), we only use tweets in English with over 100 retweets. These are dated between January and November 2020, resulting in a total of 424,073 tweets. We do not edit the content of the tweets, and each model defines its own input representation based on the text of the tweet. Models that use multimodal aspects of the tweets are not represented in the current study; this is left for future work. To match claims and tweets, Hossain, et al. (2020) used BERTScore (Zhang, Kishore, Wu, Weinberger, & Artzi, 2020), which resulted in only 15% of the pairings being actual matches. We found that BM25-based (Robertson, et al., 1995) re-ranking methods are better at retrieving relevant tweets compared to BERTbased methods, with BM25+Mono T5 re-ranking (Nogueira, Lin, & Epistemic, 2019) being the most effective in our preliminary experiments.
Tweet retrieval with BM25+Mono T5 To match claims with relevant tweets we index the set of tweets and use claims as queries. We retrieve the top 100 matches per claim.6 according to their BM25 score and then re-rank these retrieved pairs using the Mono T5 model. We use the implementation of BM25 in Pyserini and Mono T5 re-ranking in Pygaggle Python packages.7 The scores returned by the re-ranking algorithm are converted to relevance probabilities, and only claim-tweet pairs with probability threshold > 90%8 are kept for annotation (resulting in 1215 instances to annotate).

5 https://github.com/ucinlp/covid19-data 6 We found in preliminary experiments that 100 matches per claim gives us enough good matches but that also that the amount of relevant instances decreases the closer we get to the 100th instance. 7 https://github.com/castorini/pyserini, https://github.com/castorini/pygaggle 8 In our preliminary experiments we found this to be a strong threshold that minimises the number of irrelevant instances while providing a good number of relevant claim-tweet pairs.

Tweet retrieval with DPR In addition to BM25+Mono T5 we apply the Dense Passage Retrieval9 (DPR) (Karpukhin, et al., 2020) method to the same set of tweets and claims as above. We use DPR as it represents a different type of approach compared to BM25, relying on contextual language models rather than exact word matching. We are interested to see whether it would be a complementary approach, which would allow us to retrieve instances missed by BM25. DPR employs a dual-encoder framework to produce dense representations of queries and passages using a neural encoder, e.g., BERT (Devlin, Chang, Lee, & Toutanova, 2019). Once representations are obtained, retrieval is performed using cosine similarity. We obtain our encoder by further fine-tuning on COAID (Cui & Lee, 2020) the encoder originally trained on Natural Questions, using the default settings (Kwiatkowski, et al., 2019). For annotation we take the top 20 instances for each claim. We chose this number of instances to approximately match the number of instances manually annotated for the BM25+Mono T5 matching method. Among those instances we found that the overlap between results returned by the two methods is very low (only 8%), showing that the two methods can indeed be used in a complementary manner.
Relevance annotation We annotated the tweets identified by the BM25+Mono T5 and DPR methods for relevance to the claim they were paired with. For this we used Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and recruited 3 annotators per claim-tweet instance. As per our annotation guidelines the relevance of each tweet is judged based on its connection to the specific claim, rather than the general topic of COVID-19. Annotators were given the option to open any links present in the tweet if they judged it useful for determining relevance. Annotators could also flag issues with a tweet (see Appendix B for details on annotator recruitment and guidelines). Out of 2445 annotated pairs: 1969 received 100% annotator agreement, i.e., all 3 annotators selected the same label (relevant or non-relevant), 21 pairs were flagged as having an issue by at least one of the annotators and in 681 tweets links were opened by at least one of the annotators. The top two rows of Table 2 shows the results of manual annotation of relevance on claim-tweet pairs returned by both matching methods. We found that BM25+Mono T5 re-ranking returns many more relevant claim-tweet pairs than DPR.
We then dropped any accidental duplicates, instances flagged as having an issue and included only relevant tweets with 100% annotator agreement in the next round of annotations for stance.
Stance annotation Tweets annotated as relevant were subsequently annotated for stance, which is known to be particularly useful for rumour verification from social media conversations (Zubiaga, Kochkina, et al., 2018). The stance annotation interface was similar to the relevance annotation one but, rather than using MTurk workers, we employed students and university staff volunteers from the United States with English proficiency. Annotation guidelines (Appendix C) provide instructions and examples for labelling the stance of a tweet towards a claim as either: Agree if the tweet agrees with the claim, Disagree if it disagrees, and No Stance if the tweet expresses no opinion towards the claim.10 As before, annotators could flag any issues with tweets and three annotators worked on each claim-tweet pair. We labelled each claim-tweet pair as Agree, Disagree, or No Stance based on the majority agreement between annotators, or as Tie/No label if there was no consensus. The inter-annotator agreement was 88%. This was computed as the average percent agreement between annotators per instance. The four bottom rows of Table 2 present the results of the stance annotation for each of the matching methods. We observe that the majority of relevant tweets agree with the matched claim.
Collecting conversations As in previous work involving the resolution of social media rumours (see Section 2.1) we collect conversations consisting of tweets discussing the rumour. For tweets that are labelled as either Agree or Disagree, we collect the associated conversations using the Twitter API v2. The majority of tweets (97%) initiate the conversations (i.e., are source tweets), so we use their IDs to download the replies tree. When an annotated tweet is not a source tweet, we download the tweet object first, then get the conversation ID and finally get the conversation. For each conversation, we reconstruct the conversation tree using parent-child tweet pairs.
We notice that COVID-RV contains more tweets per conversation than other datasets (see Table 3), which may be due to several reasons: (1) we choose our source tweets to be the tweets that attracted at least 100 retweets. While this is also a criterion for source tweet selection in the PHEME dataset, the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted unprecedented attention from the public worldwide compared to events in PHEME and other datasets; and (2) the set of claims that COVID-RV contains are the ones that have attracted
9 https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR 10 This stance annotation approach differs from the one in the PHEME dataset as here we are mainly interested in the Agree and Disagree categories for source tweets of the conversations so as to provide veracity labels to the conversations, rather than labelling all of the responses in order to gain explicit fine-grained support patterns (as in PHEME), which could be done as part of future work for this dataset.

the most attention out of all circulating claims since they are described in Wikipedia. This property of COVID-RV differentiates it from previous datasets. However, this a natural effect, mainly linked to the prominence and scale of a rumour and it can not be controlled for when collecting new unseen rumours and events. Furthermore Ma et al. (2018) and Bian, et al. (2020) show performance increase in time as more information becomes available.
Veracity labels Rumour verification models operating on conversation threads require veracity labels. We label conversations on the basis of the source tweet of the conversation introducing the rumour. The conversation is labelled as `False' if the corresponding source tweet agrees with the rumour and `True' otherwise. Table 3 shows the resulting number of tweets contained in conversations around the claims, as well as the statistics for other rumour datasets we use for training in Section 4. Fig. 1 shows an example of an instance from our dataset.
4 Evaluating rumour verification models
4.1 Models
Here we describe the models whose generalisability we test across datasets. These models were selected among the topperforming rumour verification models with publicly available code that enabled reproducibility. In all cases, we keep the original model parameters proposed in the corresponding articles. This selection includes comparison of models of different types in terms of: (1) the input word-level representation, including models that take as input one-hot embeddings and Bag-of-Words representations (TD-RvNN, BiGCN, SAVED), ones that take Word2vec (Mikolov, Chen, Corrado, & Dean, 2013) embeddings (branchLSTM) and large contextual LMs (BERT, CT-BERT); (2) the representation of the conversation structure including models that use trees (TDRvNN,BiGCN), linear sequences (branchLSTM, SAVED) or individual tweets only (BERT, CT-BERT); (3) vocabulary associated with the rumour, with most models unaware of COVID vocabulary and a couple exposed to unannotated COVID tweets (CT-BERT, CTSAVED). See summary of model properties in Table 4. Here we focus our study on single-task learning models. Since multitask learning has been a very successful method for rumour verification (Lee, et al., 2021), we plan to explore this setting in future work. An overview of the models chosen is provided below:
branchLSTM Kochkina and Liakata (2020), Kochkina et al. (2018) uses linear tweet branches from rumour conversations as input and an LSTM-based model to process them.11 An average of per-branch predictions is used to obtain the final veracity prediction for the full tree. This model was originally proposed for RumourEval-2017 dataset (Kochkina, Liakata, & Augenstein, 2017) and then was tested on PHEME (Kochkina et al., 2018) and Twitter15/16 (Kochkina & Liakata, 2020). It was also a strong baseline for RumourEval-2019 (Gorrell, et al., 2019).
Top-Down Recursive Neural Networks (TD-RvNN) Ma et al. (2018) are top-down tree-structured neural networks for rumour representation learning and classification, which naturally conform to the propagation layout of tweets or a tree structure of a conversation.12 This model was originally proposed and tested on Twitter15/16 datasets (Ma et al., 2018).
Bidirectional Graph Convolutional Neural Network (BiGCN) Bian, et al. (2020) operates on both top-down and bottom-up propagation of rumours.13 It leverages a GCN with a top-down directed graph of rumour spreading to learn the patterns of rumour propagation, and a GCN with an opposite directed graph of rumour diffusion to capture the structures of rumour dispersion. This model was originally proposed on and tested on Twitter15/16 and Weibo datasets in Bian, et al. (2020).
Stance-Augmented VAE Disentanglement framework (SAVED) Dougrez-Lewis et al. (2021) is a two stage approach to rumour verification, the current state-of-the-art on the PHEME dataset.14 First, a Variational Autoencoder is used to obtain representations of each rumour by disentangling the informational content of a tweet from the manner in which it is written. This is achieved by obtaining latent topic vectors in an adversarial learning setting using the auxiliary task of stance classification. The resulting latent vectors are then used to predict rumour veracity. This model was originally proposed and tested on the PHEME-5 dataset, i.e., using only the 5 largest events from PHEME. Here we use the full PHEME dataset with 9 events, therefore reported results differ from Dougrez-Lewis et al. (2021). We have also trained a CT-SAVED model which is a variant of SAVED, where the Variational

Fig. 1. Example instance from the COVID-RV dataset. Each instance contains a False claim, a Relevant source tweet annotated as Agreeing or Disagreeing with the claim, as well as tree-structured conversation around the source tweet conveying the rumour.
Autoencoder is trained using the data from the training set as well as additional unlabelled COVID-19 Twitter conversations.15 Thus the topic-discourse module of the CT-SAVED model has been exposed to COVID-19 vocabulary and can therefore produce COVID-19-aware tweet representations. Large pre-trained language models BERT Devlin et al. (2019) and CT-BERT (Müller, Salathé, & Kummervold, 2020).16 We use these to obtain a representation and then classify rumours based purely on the source tweet of the conversation. We compare a generalpurpose pre-COVID BERT model with a Twitter-specific one that includes a more up-to-date lexicon of COVID tweets (CT-BERT). BERT has been previously tested on the PHEME-5 dataset in Dougrez-Lewis et al. (2021) in a similar setting.
4.2 Data
To train the models we use publicly available datasets of Twitter rumour conversations (see Table 3 for details). These include:
PHEME Twitter conversations discussing rumours about nine breaking news events, which were labelled as True, False or Unverified by journalists (Zubiaga, et al., 2016). The PHEME dataset also contains conversations that discuss the same events but are labelled as Non-Rumours (Kochkina et al., 2018).
Twitter15/16 The Twitter15 and Twitter16 datasets (Ma et al., 2017) were created using reference datasets from Ma, et al. (2016) and Liu, Nourbakhsh, Li, Fang, and Shah (2015). Claims were annotated using veracity labels on the basis of articles corresponding to claims found in rumour debunking websites such as snopes.com and emergent.info. These datasets merge rumour detection and verification into a single, four-way classification task containing True, False and Unverified rumours as well as Non-Rumours.
Both datasets are split into 5 folds for cross-validation and, contrary to the PHEME dataset, folds are of approximately equal size with a balanced class distribution. It is not possible to apply leave-one-event-out cross-validation to Twitter15 and Twitter16 datasets as the event split is not provided. The overall data format is practically equivalent in all of the datasets (as shown in Fig. 1), which enables their use within the same rumour verification models interchangeably.
4.3 Experiment setup
We split our experiments into 4 groups:
1. In-dataset evaluation of models (on PHEME, Twitter15, Twitter16) using the evaluation strategy per dataset as published in previous works (leave-one-event-out cross-validation for PHEME and 5-fold cross-validation for Twitter15, Twitter16);
2. Cross-dataset evaluation of models on datasets from a similar time period (training on PHEME, testing on Twitter15/Twitter16 and vice versa);
15 We have collected approximately 19,000 conversations discussing COVID-19 using a subset of tweets from our filtered COVID-19 set of tweets. 16 https://huggingface.co

3. Cross-dataset temporal robustness assessment by evaluating all models on COVID-RV. This presents models with new rumours distant in time from the training data. When evaluating the models on COVID-RV we also compare results obtained using different training datasets and their combinations, to evaluate the effect of existing resources on model performance.
4. Assessing few-shot learning capabilities of the models on COVID-RV.
We use the following training combinations: 3-class classification with PHEME dataset (PHEME3, i.e. True(T)/ False(F)/ Unverified(U)), 4-class classification with PHEME dataset (PHEME4, i.e. True(T)/ False(F)/ Unverified(U)/ Non-Rumour(NR)), 4class classification with Twitter15, Twitter16 datasets, and combinations of Twitter15 + Twitter16 and Twitter15 + Twitter16 + PHEME3 The new COVID-RV dataset is used exclusively for testing. While the PHEME dataset also has 4 classes, in previous work it is usually split into two separate tasks - binary rumour detection (Rumour vs Non-Rumour) and 3-way veracity classification (T/F/U). Here, to enable cross-dataset evaluation between PHEME and Twitter15/16, we use all available conversations from PHEME together for 4-way classification. While COVID-RV used for testing only has True and False classes, we chose to train the models using the original number of labels in the training datasets, including Unverified and Non-rumour classes. We aim to imitate a realistic scenario in which an existing pre-trained model is used for predictions.
In our experiments we truncate the largest conversations from COVID-RV to have a maximum of 1000 branches, and use the first 20 responses from each branch in order to make it computationally feasible.
We keep all the original hyper-parameter values as fixing hyper-parameters allows us to compare the models in different training settings (see the values in Appendix D). We report the result of a single run in our results tables.
We evaluate the performance of our models in terms of accuracy and macro-averaged F1-score. Macro-averaged F1-score (MF) is particularly suitable to evaluate performance on the PHEME dataset as it contains significant class imbalance. Evaluation on COVID-RV mainly focuses on per-class performance for the True and False classes.
5 Results
5.1 Generalisability across datasets from the same time period
Table 5 shows in- and cross-dataset model performance for datasets from a similar time period (PHEME and Twitter15/16,17 both from 2014-2016). In the in-dataset experiments we do not observe a consistent ranking of model performance. We acknowledge that this observation can be somewhat affected by tuning hyper-parameters of each model to each dataset individually. However, it is not the goal of this paper to reach the highest possible performance with each model, but to evaluate their generalisability in various settings. Thus we preserve the hyper-parameters across our experiments for fair comparison between setups. BERT and BiGCN models do consistently better than branchLSTM, TD-RvNN and SAVED in this setting. Performance on the PHEME dataset
17 Here we only present results of training on Twitter15 when evaluating on PHEME as Twitter15 is the largest of the two very similar datasets.

is noticeably lower than on Twitter15/16. This could be due to several important differences in the datasets. Firstly, performance on the PHEME dataset is evaluated using leave-one-event-out cross-validation, while Twitter15/16 are split into 5 folds without separation between events. The folds in PHEME are of different size and different class proportions, while Twitter15/16 folds are balanced. Evaluation on the PHEME dataset is more challenging and closer to a real-world setting.
In the cross-dataset experiments between PHEME and Twitter15/16, we observe a sizeable performance drop (RQ1). This highlights that none of the datasets realistically represent the distribution of the unseen data and the original performance was overestimated. We notice that for models trained on PHEME4 and evaluated on Twitter15/16 the drop in macro-averaged F1-score is not as dramatic compared to the drop of the models trained on Twitter15. This indicates that the performance on PHEME is not overestimated to the same degree because of its more realistic evaluation setup (RQ6).
We find that for models trained on PHEME4 the performance ranking order of models remains similar, with BiGCN and BERT being the top performing models (RQ3). However, for models trained on Twitter15 and evaluated on PHEME, there is a dramatic drop in performance, the performance ranking is flipped, and the simpler branchLSTM model gives the best results (RQ3). This shows that previous performance scores and even model ranking can be unreliable when tested on a dataset different to the one used for training (RQ2). The performance of the models trained on PHEME4 dataset is also higher comparing to models trained on Twitter15. It shows the robustness of models trained on a dataset which contains cross-event variability, such as PHEME.

5.2 Generalisability to COVID-RV
Table 6 shows the performance of rumour verification models on COVID-RV using different training data scenarios. In all of the scenarios, due to its size, COVID-RV is only used for testing and not for training. The training dataset used is shown in the column names. We observe very low performance scores in terms of accuracy and macro-averaged F1-score; all the models score lower than a majority class baseline in terms of macro-averaged F1-score, demonstrating the challenge of generalising across time (RQ1). These low performance scores can be somewhat explained by the fact that the models are trained to predict three or four classes rather

than two, and in experiments with 3-way classification we see higher performance than in those with 4-classes.18 For example, zero performance occurs in several cases with the CT-BERT model when it predicts all of the instances as either `Non-rumour' or `Unverified'. However, we chose to preserve the amount of classes in the data as our task is to imitate the realistic scenario in which ready made models are facing new data with new vocabularies and class balance.
We find that model ranking differs from what we observed in previous experiments (RQ2). Each of the models outperforms the rest for some training dataset in Table 6, especially SAVED and CT-SAVED. This is no longer the case for BiGCN and BERT, which now have the lowest performance. When we calculate the mean average of scores per model across all training settings, SAVED (the model which exploits the difference in topics discussed in a conversation from they way they are discussed) has the highest performance in terms of both accuracy and macro-averaged F1-score (RQ3).
When we look at overall performance in Table 6 we can notice that not all of the models benefit from using all of the datasets for training. In particular, some models experience changes in performance when using combinations of the datasets (e.g., CT-BERT model trained on Twitter15 or Twitter16 individually has better performance than on their combination, and when training on Twitter15 it performs better than training on all three datasets combined). This is somewhat expected and can be explained by the combinations of datasets affecting per class performance differently, e.g., due to differences in class balance. As a result the models in some cases will start predicting the classes not present in the testing data more frequently. When we calculate the average performance for each of the datasets from Table 6 across all pre-COVID models (i.e. excluding CT-BERT and CT-SAVED), we find that indeed on average the best performance is achieved by the combination of all three training datasets (RQ4).
In our experiments, both across PHEME and Twitter15/16 datasets and testing on COVID-RV, unlike Gröndahl, et al. (2018), who found that the choice of training data is more significant than the choice of the model architecture for model generalisability (see Section 2.2), we do not observe that the change of model architecture has a significantly higher or lower impact on rumour verification performance than the change of the training dataset.
Given the low overall scores, we focus on per-class evaluation on the True and False classes to compare performance of models in various training setups. Fig. 2 shows per-class F-scores for True and False classes for each model and training set. These results in a table format, including per-class precision and recall, can be found in Table 7, along with Figs. 3 and 4 visualising per-class precision and recall. The best performing model needs to score high on both the True and False class, thus models that have balanced performance on both classes would lie along an  =  line on Fig. 2. On the plot we can see that models trained on PHEME3 tend to perform better on the True class as it is a majority class in that dataset, while models trained on Twitter15 perform better on the False class. Models trained on the combinations of all of the training data are the closest to the  =  line, i.e., have the most balanced performance. The CT-SAVED model trained on the Twitter15 dataset stands out in Fig. 2 as having the best and most balanced performance, followed by TD-RvNN and CT-SAVED trained on all of the training datasets. We also found per-class precision to be consistently higher than recall across the majority of the experiments, which is expected due to a high number of instances being classified as either Non-Rumour or Unverified.
We also test the benefits of using embeddings trained with data covering the topic and time period in the test set via CT-BERT and CT-SAVED. Results in Table 6 show that CT-BERT performs better than BERT in most cases. CT-SAVED also outperforms SAVED in most setups. This confirms that updating embeddings is a promising method to improve performance of rumour verification models for new rumour events in line with work in other fields (Alkhalifa et al., 2021) (RQ7 ).

5.3 Few-shot learning experiments

Few-shot learning (Wang, Yao, et al., 2020) enables testing the ability of models to learn effectively from a small number of instances. We evaluate the benefits of few-shot learning in experiments with COVID-RV, combining it with the use of up-to-date COVID tweet (CT) embeddings (RQ7 ). We consider two settings: (1) adding one conversation from each claim into the training data; and (2) adding three conversations from each claim. We have made this choice of a number of instances to add so that all of the claims would receive equal coverage among the few-shot learning examples added to the training. The COVID-RV dataset is not very large, and some claims only have 5 tweets associated with them. A few-shot learning approach implies only using a small amount of data, and therefore we chose to use 1 example per claim (lowest possible) and 3 examples per claim (towards the higher end, whist still being applicable to all of the claims). This setup somewhat changes our task as now the model is exposed to a set of annotated conversations around each claim during training and thus `knows' the correct facts or has a chance of memorising them. Here we used the combination of all datasets (Twitter15+Twitter16+PHEME3) as our training data. Table 8 shows performance of the four-class classification models in a few-shot learning setup in terms of accuracy and macro-averaged F1-score. We compare these to the results in the last column of Table 6 (denoted as zero-shot in Table 8). We see improvement of performance for all of the models. Adding more instances is also beneficial in most of the cases. The observed performance is now on par with performance in evaluation across datasets from a similar time period. Therefore, few-shot learning helps bridge the gap between the datasets distant in topic and time. However, there is still need for improvement to reach the in-dataset performance.
We have also analysed these performance improvements from the per-class perspective (see Table 9). The combination of the few-shot approach with updated CT embeddings leads to further improvement in per-class performance. As COVID-RV is imbalanced towards the False class, our few-shot sample is also imbalanced towards False, therefore, for most of the models we see higher improvement in per-class performance for the False class.

18 We have additionally performed binary classification experiments. We present and discuss them in Appendix E as the outcomes align with the conclusions we draw on the full datasets.

We find that CT-SAVED and CT-BERT benefit the most from few-shot training and result in a relatively balanced performance on the True and False classes compared to TD-RvNN and BiGCN, which perform poorly and do not show improvement in the True class. This could be explained by the ability of these models to make better use of the COVID vocabulary, recognising post COVID words as meaningful rather than treating them as unknown tokens, which would make it harder to learn these from few-shot examples. The strengths of CT-SAVED and CT-BERT appear complementary to each other with CT-BERT performing best on the False class, and CT-SAVED performing best on the True class.
5.4 Effect of distance between datasets
We hypothesise that a performance drop arises from differences between training and test data and that the performance gap decreases the closer the datasets are to each other (RQ5). To test this hypothesis we measure the difference between datasets using the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL) ( ), Jaccard Index (Intersection over Union - IoU) and DICE coefficient. We chose

these metrics because they are common metrics to measure distance between corpora (Lu, Henchion, & Mac Namee, 2021; Peinelt, Liakata, & Nguyen, 2019). We define them below.

A corpus can be regarded as a probability distribution across words in a vocabulary, and the KL divergence between two corpora

the probabilities of observing word  in corpus  and  respectively estimated through dividing the th word occurrence frequency

by the total number of words in the corpus.

The Jaccard Index (Intersection over Union - IoU) and DICE coefficient are calculated using the following equations:

 = |    | , |    |

 = 2 × |    | , | | + | |
where   and   - are the sets of unique words from two corpora, | | denotes the size of the set, thus |    | - number of unique words present in the intersection of the corpora vocabularies, and |    | - number of unique words present in the union of   and  .
IoU and DICE equal to 1 when the datasets are identical, and zero for datasets with no vocabulary overlap. KL divergence is zero when the datasets are identical and has an unbounded upper value when the datasets are dissimilar. Further, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the distance scores and mean average of accuracy scores across models for the corresponding dataset pairs. Table 10 shows the distance metrics and average performance scores for the dataset pairs as well as Pearson correlation coefficients between the two. Note that IoU and DICE are symmetrical metrics (do not depend on the order of  and ), while KL divergence is not. Non-symmetrical metric in our case is beneficial to use in order to distinguish between setups in which training and testing datasets switch places. For example, cross-dataset evaluation between PHEME4 and Twitter 15 leads to different outcomes for the model performance depending which dataset was used for training. In Table 10 the dataset shown on the left is used for training , and the one of the right for testing  . Within dataset performance evaluations follow cross-validation procedure, so the distance metrics shown in Table 10 are mean average of distance scores calculated for each fold.
We find a negative correlation between the model performance and distance between datasets for all metrics, i.e. the higher the distance, the lower the performance scores. Adding few-shot examples into the training somewhat decreases the distance between datasets in line with improvement in experimental results when using few-shot learning. This highlights that, indeed, the vocabulary difference is an important factor for performance drop. The correlation is strong for KL divergence (coefficient of -0.76), and only moderate for IoU and DICE (coefficient values around 0.3), therefore KL divergence is a more suitable metric and holds some predictive power of an expected performance drop.

5.5 Effect of conversation length
Investigating which data properties may be related to performance drop, another aspect to be explored is the role of conversation length across rumours. For example, Zubiaga, et al. (2016) found that, in the PHEME dataset, the longer the conversations are, the more likely they are to diverge from the original topic. By contrast Ma et al. (2018) and Bian, et al. (2020) show that for Twitter15/16 performance increases in time as more information becomes available. These contradictory observations indicate a difference in the speed of topic shift within conversations across different datasets, which may affect model performance. Such topic shifts should therefore be exploited both in training and in evaluating robust models.
We consider whether the lengths of the conversations in COVID-RV affect the performance of the models. For each instance in COVID-RV and for each model we calculate in how many training settings the model made a correct prediction, as a proxy for the instance `difficulty', as well as the length and the depth of the corresponding conversation. We then calculate Pearson correlation coefficients between the conversation `difficulty' and its length and depth. Table 11 shows these Pearson correlation coefficients for each of the models. We find that the correlation coefficients are very low and thus we cannot establish either a positive or negative effect of the conversation length on model performance in this case.

6 Discussion

Information Processing and Management 60 (2023) 103116

This section discusses the implications of this research for future work on automated social media rumour verification. The main goals were to analyse whether automated rumour verification models would encounter generalisability issues (RQ1) and, if so, where the challenges lie such that future research directions can focus on those aspects (RQ2-7 ). RQ2,3,7 involve the role of model architecture and understanding what properties of models may affect generalisability, while RQ4-6 discuss the role of training data and setup.
RQ1: How well can rumour verification models generalise to unseen rumours across datasets from similar time periods and those more distant in time? For RQ1 we found a drastic performance drop for both types of cross-dataset experiments. This lack of generalisability undermines the practical value of rumour verification models and highlights the need for further efforts to create generalisable methods. The fact that the original performance of each model was overestimated highlights that none of the datasets can realistically represent the distribution of the unseen data.

Discussion on the role of models in generalisability of rumour verification systems

RQ2: If the models experience performance drop on unseen datasets, will the ranking of model performance evaluated across datasets align with the ranking of these models when evaluated within one dataset? Considering RQ2, we discovered variability of model rankings when tested outside the original dataset. This suggests that developing models and evaluating them within a single dataset is not enough to ensure creation of generalisable approaches to rumour verification for real-world applications. It is crucial to test models on events unseen during training (see also RQ6) and to include cross-dataset evaluation. Novel techniques that are able to better promote generalisability of rumour verification models is an important research direction.
RQ3: Which models or groups of models show better generalisability? There doesn't seem to be a model or group of models that consistently generalise better across datasets. However, in the experiments with COVID-RV, SAVED (the model that obtains conversations around rumours by disentangling the topic and the manner of speech) has shown promising results. For future work this suggests that we need to develop models that use or find generalisable features indicative of rumour veracity (potential examples could be user stance or propagation patterns). We should draw on developments in domain adaptation and generalisability domains (Ramponi & Plank, 2020; Wang, et al., 2021), incorporating generalisability tools and approaches into rumour verification models.
RQ7: How receptive are different models to strategies such as few-shot learning and using embeddings updated with data from a new rumour? Our investigation of RQ7 found that updating word embeddings and providing models with a few training examples from a new event (few-shot learning) helps bridge the gap between datasets distant in topic and time with BERT and SAVED models benefiting the most. Thus, updating and/or temporally aligning (Alkhalifa et al., 2021) embeddings may be important in improving performance across time. Ni et al. (2021) show that BERT fine-tuned for rumour detection cannot identify common sense rumours with more than 50% accuracy. Incorporating commonsense knowledge and other inductive biases along with few-shot learning could be fruitful avenues for improving generalisability in future research. Bragg, Cohan, Lo, and Beltagy (2021) introduce a few-shot NLP benchmark and provide recommendations for reliable few-shot evaluation, which can aid future work on developing strong few-shot learners. However, these are only available when there is access to some labelled or unlabelled data from the domain of interest.

Discussion on the role of training data in generalisability of rumour verification systems

RQ4: Which training datasets lead to better model generalisability? Does increasing the size of the training data improve generalisability? The quality of the training data is one of the key elements for training a generalisable model (Wang, et al., 2021). In this work we performed experiments with the widely used benchmark datasets for automated rumour verification and we investigated the impact of different combinations of datasets in training. While we found that the aggregate of all datasets does not always lead to performance improvement, on average the best performance is indeed achieved by combining all three training datasets. A considerable limitation in rumour verification research is the small size of existing datasets. A possible way to address this would be to develop novel strategies for effectively leveraging combinations of existing datasets with differences in annotations, e.g., through transfer and/or multitask learning. Alternatively, creating synthetic data instances or whole datasets can be beneficial and also lead to modelling innovation, as shown in Liu, Lee, Jia, and Liang (2021). Overall, we did not find strong effects that would suggest that we should weigh the contributions of training data over model architecture or vice versa, thus we recommend that future research should look into both of these directions.
RQ5: Which data properties may be related to performance drop? We have shown that the difference between training and testing datasets is an important factor in performance drop. We have measured the distance between dataset vocabularies and argue that metrics such as KL divergence can be potentially used to estimate expected performance drop of a model. Other metrics defining the `distance' between benchmarks can be also explored, e.g. benchmark concurrence as defined in Liu et al. (2021). However, we recommend that other data properties should also be covered in future work. These could be model-specific and depend on the produced embeddings, e.g., for fake news detection, Zhou, et al. (2021) show that similarity between RoBERTa embeddings of article titles in training and testing datasets are correlated with performance. The differences in stance and propagation patterns could also be addressed more explicitly in future work given extra annotations, rather than implicitly through models utilising conversations.
An approach to assess model behaviour and thus reveal potential deficiencies in the data used for training them, is to use a checklist (Ribeiro, Wu, Guestrin, & Singh, 2020). A checklist is a set of unit tests to assess different aspects of model functionality.

16

E. Kochkina et al.

Information Processing and Management 60 (2023) 103116

Task-specific checklists can be created, e.g. Röttger, et al. (2021) created one for hate speech, which includes low level functional tests such as `leet speak' as well as higher level test instances containing `hate expressed using slurs' vs `hate expressed using profanity'. Ni et al. (2021) show that rumour detection models can learn shortcuts due to spurious correlation between words and veracity labels in training datasets. Checklists could be used to identify such data artefacts and further expand training data by creating artificial and, perhaps, adversarial examples. In the case of rumour verification, handling negations correctly would be a very important test. Human-created negative variations of claims used in COVID-RV are made available by Hossain, et al. (2020). Additional negations can be created using checklists. Furthermore, Zhou, et al. (2021) find that unreliable news detection datasets can be biased by the ways they are curated, annotated, and split. Steps should be taken to identify and mitigate these biases in rumour verification datasets.
RQ6: Does the evaluation strategy used in the original training dataset play a role in training more generalisable models or more realistically estimating their future performance? We find that indeed the evaluation strategy used in the original training dataset does play a role in realistically estimating model performance. The performance on the PHEME dataset is not overestimated to the same degree as it allows evaluation through a leave-one-event-out cross-validation setting. This enables a more challenging and realistic evaluation scenario, leading to lower but more reliable scores. Thus, here we highlight again that releasing datasets that cover multiple events is a good practice that should be followed in future work.
There are important limitations that make rumour verification a challenging task. Rumour conversations may not always contain sufficient information to support a veracity verdict. Models may rely on the stances of users or their choice of words (learning rules like ``formal language is more trustworthy'', or ``expression of doubt is indicative of unverified rumours''), rather than evidence. We believe that this may be addressed by combining social media signals with signals extracted from a range of trusted sources, such as peer-reviewed publications, trustworthy news organisations, independent fact-checking organisations, etc. Finally, annotating datasets in such a way that helps models learn to identify and provide explanations for their predictions (rationales) is also important if they are to be trusted and thus be effective in real-world settings (Jain, Kumar, & Shrivastava, 2022).

7 Conclusions

We have evaluated, quantified and characterised the generalisability of social media rumour verification models in two settings: across datasets from similar time periods and on a newly collected COVID-19 dataset, distant in time from the training data. We have demonstrated a significant performance drop in both settings, which is further pronounced when datasets are distant in time. The extent of the divergence between training and testing datasets is analogous to the drop in performance. We found that fewshot learning and updating unsupervised embeddings with posts from the new events reduces the drop in performance. However, significant scope for improvement remains and, based on our findings, we have outlined directions for future work.

Ethical considerations

This work involves ethical considerations concerning the spread of rumours and misinformation on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. Although the systems analysed in this work are intended to prevent such information from being disseminated, the data we collect for evaluating these systems could potentially be mis-purposed by bad actors to adversarially construct misinformation that avoids detection.
Pending publication, the COVID-RV dataset will be released in compliance with the Twitter Developer guidelines, which require further compliance of all downstream users of our data. These guidelines include provisions that users of our dataset do not disclose the identities of Twitter users who have protected or deleted their accounts or tweets during or after data collection.
Annotations were collected using a combination of paid crowd workers and student volunteers. Crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk were paid $2.05 per HIT (Human Intelligence Task), which was calculated using the wage of $11.93 per hour and our estimation of average time to complete the HIT, where each HIT included annotation of 15 claim-tweet pairs.

The following changes were made to the claims (misconceptions) from COVIDLies:
· Removal: Political: Claims pertaining to the actions of particular political parties, governments, religious groups, or ethnicities, were removed. Eg. `Trump is fulfilling his promise to hit Iranian cultural sites, if Iranians took revenge for the US airstrike that killed of Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani.' Multi-modal: Claims about non-textual modalities, such as, images and videos were removed. Eg. `Coronavirus is a statesupported ``a bioweapon that went rogue'' and also fake videos alleging that Chinese authorities are killing citizens to prevent its spread.' Duplicates: De-duplication of claims was performed. Eg. `Holy communion cannot be the cause of the spread of coronavirus' was removed while `Coronavirus cannot be spread by practicing holy communion.' was kept.
· Compound to atomic: Compound claims were split into atomic misconceptions. Eg. Avocado and mint tea, hot whiskey and honey, essential oils, vitamins c and d, fennel tea and cocaine cure coronavirus.  `Avocado and mint tea cures coronavirus.', `Essential oils cure coronavirus.', `Vitamin C cures coronavirus.', `Vitamin D cures coronavirus.', `Fennel tea cures coronavirus.', and `Cocaine cures coronavirus.'
· Corrections: Eg. `There were more than 50000 cremations in Wuhan for 4th Quarter, 2020.'  'There were more than 50000 cremations in Wuhan for 4th Quarter, 2019.'
· Edits: Eg.`Chloroquine was used to cure over 12,000 covid-19 patients.'  `Chloroquine can cure coronavirus.'

Appendix B. Relevance annotation instructions

As qualification criteria, we asked that workers must: be from an English-speaking country19; have completed more than 100 assignments; have assignment approval rate over 95%. Furthermore, workers had to pass a qualification test by annotating 7 claim- tweet pairs from the CovidLies dataset and get over 70% of correct answers. We recruited 3 annotators for each claim-tweet instance.
Fig. A1 shows the relevance annotation interface.
Instructions Goals. You will be given a claim and a list of tweets. Your task is to tag whether the tweet is relevant to the given claim, i.e. whether the tweet and the claim are closely connected. The relevance of each tweet should be judged based on its connection to the specific claim rather than the general topic of coronavirus COVID-19. Relevant tweets do not have to agree with the claim, but they have to discuss the main topic of the claim. Tweets conveying sarcastic or joking sentiment should not be excluded as they could also be relevant. Relevance should not be judged on the basis of the annotator's personal views towards the topic. Choosing a ``relevant'' or ``not relevant'' option for each tweet is compulsory. External Links. If a tweet contains a link, the contents of the link can be used to identify the relevance of the tweet to the claim. To access the link copy-paste it into your browser. If you opened a link, please tick the box under the tweet to indicate that. Please be advised that the Requester has not checked the content of links included in the tweets. Issues and Comments. If there is an issue with annotating a claim-tweet pair, there is an option to flag it using the checkbox in the right bottom corner of the box bounding each tweet. This includes blank text, text in a different language and inappropriate content. If you have any comment regarding the task or a particular instance there is a free text comment form at the bottom of the page. Examples. (1) Claim: Coronavirus is caused by 5G.

Tag: Not Relevant Explanation: The tweet talks about Huawei and 5G, not the causes of COVID-19
Appendix C. Stance annotation instructions
Fig. A2 shows the stance annotation interface. Goals. You will be given a claim and a list of tweets. Your task is to tag the stance of the tweet towards the given claim, i.e. whether the tweet is agreeing with the topic of the given claim (Agrees), disagreeing with it (Disagrees), or expressing no stance towards it (No Stance). Stance should not be judged on the basis of the annotator's personal views towards the topic. Choosing a Agrees, Disagrees, or No Stance option for each tweet is compulsory. When selecting a label of No Stance you must provide an explanation for why you think the tweet expresses no stance towards the claim. Questions. Tweets that are questions can be tricky. Carefully consider your selected label in these cases.

Appendix E. Binary classification experiments
While we consider the setup in which the existing, pre-trained models are applied to the new data regardless of the number of original labels, in the interest of approximating a realistic scenario, this setup may also lead to an underestimated performance. To address concerns about the mismatch between the number of labels in the training and testing sets we have performed binary classification experiments to compare performance between setups: (1) within dataset cross-validation and (2) training on the PHEME, Twitter 15 and Twitter 16 datasets and their combinations, then testing on COVID-RV. We have selected a subset of the models to perform these additional experiments with due to computational constraints, namely: SAVED, BERT and their COVIDaware variations CT-SAVED and CT-BERT. These models yielded the highest performance for four class classification on COVID-RV (see Table 6). The results are presented in Table A.1 for within dataset experiments and Table A.2 for results when testing the models across datasets on COVID-RV. We find that these results align with the conclusions from Tables 5 and 6. The PHEME dataset provides a more challenging scenario than Twitter 15 and Twitter 16 in the within dataset setting, thus the performance is not as strongly overestimated when evaluating on COVID-RV. CT-BERT and CT-SAVED show better performance than their COVID unaware versions in most cases on COVID-RV. Model performance benefits from larger training data size.

PEG allergy -- A COVID-19 pandemic-made problem? A German perspective
Rebekka K. Bent MD, BSC, Valentina Faihs MD, Linda Tizek MPH, Tilo Biedermann MD, Alexander Zink MPH, MD, PhD and Knut Brockow MD*
ABSTRACT
Background: Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been used for decades, but only caused allergic
reactions exceptionally. Introduction of PEG-containing COVID-19 vaccines might have fostered public interest beyond medical reasoning.
Objectives: To investigate the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the public interest in PEG
allergy in Germany and the published PEG allergy cases worldwide.
Methods: A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted to measure public interest in PEG
allergy analyzing Google search volume in Germany from February 2018 to January 2022. Medically confirmed "PEG allergy" cases were analyzed by looking at the numbers of PubMed case reports and case series from 1977 until January 2022.
Results: Web results in Germany before COVID-19 show search volumes related to "PEG allergy/
testing" was negligible, with 10 search queries per month. The pandemic led to a >200-fold increase from 250 queries 2 years before to 55 720 queries 2 years thereafter, reflecting tremendous public interest. Additionally, the maximum monthly search volume from before to during the pandemic increased immensely for "vaccination" (57-fold), "vaccination and adverse effects" (85fold), "vaccination and allergy" (71-fold). In contrast, the increase of publication numbers for the search term "PEG allergy" was small from 2019 to 2021 (2.5-fold). Only a very low number of 211 cases with "PEG allergy" worldwide since 1977 could be identified.
Conclusion: PEG allergy became a topic of major public interest because of COVID-19 vacci-
nation. Scientific publications have increased to a lesser extent, probably promoted by public awareness. Conversely, the overall number of cases published with PEG allergy remain very low. The current high demand for COVID-19 vaccination allergy testing is triggered by public interest instead of medical reasoning.

INTRODUCTION
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a commonly used excipient in a huge amount of ubiquitously used cosmetics, drugs, and household products.1 Most recently, PEG 2000 is being used in the artificial lipid layer of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, namely Comirnaty® (BNT162b2 by Pfizer and BioNTech) and Spikevax® (mRNA 1273 by Moderna),1 but not in the Johnson & Johnson or AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines. Multiple individuals reported anaphylaxis to COVID-19 vaccination,2 with an incidence of 2.5 cases/mio doses for Moderna and 4.7/mio doses for Comirnaty® vaccinations, being 2-4 times higher than expected for other vaccinations.2 The ingredient PEG has been discussed to cause allergic reactions and to be responsible for the increased incidence of anaphylaxis.3,4 However, recent data showed that anaphylaxis reaction rates to all PEG-containing and non-PEGcontaining COVID-19 vaccines are similar to rates reported across several common other vaccines.5
Anaphylaxis to PEGs has been rarely reported before the pandemic,3,6 especially considering the widespread use in medicine.1,7 Additionally, the amount of PEG used in laxatives, eg, as Moviprep® (100 g PEG 3350) is multi-fold higher as compared to that used in COVID-19 vaccines. Comirnaty® contains 0.05 mg PEG 2000 and the amount in Spikevax® is not stated, but can be expected to be similar.8 However, it seems that broad media and internet coverage concerning the anaphylactic reaction following the Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer vaccinations ratcheted public concern about the allergenic potential of PEG.2
The number of patients seeking testing for PEG allergy/COVID-19 vaccination allergy has been dramatically high. Furthermore, people have increasingly consulted the internet for health information in the last decades. It has become a key data source, also for public health promotion.9,10
This study analyzed the impact of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic on the increasing German public and scientific interest in PEG allergy. It investigates whether Google search volume in Germany can retrace the increased interest compared to the

evolution of PubMed case reported with PEG allergy worldwide.
METHODS
Google data
In this retrospective longitudinal study, we used Google Ads Keyword Planner to identify the average monthly search volume related to PEG allergy in Germany. Usually, the tool is used to optimise placements of advertisements but it also can be successfully employed for scientific purposes.10 When entering a specific word or phrase in the tool, it provides relevant keywords including their monthly number of searches for the last 48 months. Terms associated with "vaccination", "vaccination and adverse effects", "vaccination and allergy" and "PEG allergy" were categorized and subsequently quantitatively analyzed starting from February 2018 until January 2022.
Result for "adverse effects and vaccination" were being categorized in adverse effects resulting from the Moderna/BioNTech vaccination (both of whom include PEG) or from other vaccinations than these 2 (eg, rabies, measles, AstraZeneca). The Keyword volume "vaccination" was categorized into COVID-19 vaccination related (including BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, mRNA vaccination, COVID-19 vaccination) and not COVID-19 vaccination related terms (eg, hay fever allergy). Search results covering PEG containing vaccines were additionally extracted from the COVID-19 related group. Search results related to preexisting allergies such as "hay fever" or "penicillin allergy" and vaccinations in general (eg, "vaccination by existing poll allergy", "which vaccination for allergic sufferer", "vaccinate despite hay fever") were grouped as well, excluded allergies resulting from a vaccination. Furthermore, search volume for "PEG and Allergy" was analyzed and categorized into the disease "PEG allergy" including 23 PEG-allergy-related terms and terms related to diagnosing this disease.
Search volume was correlated to the German new corona infection numbers per month provided by the Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI)11 and paired up with important pandemic events such

as the first vaccine release, STIKO (the Standing Committee on Vaccination at the German Robert Koch Institute), and World Health Organizatoin (WHO) recommendations.
PubMed data
In February 2022, a systematic literature analysis for PEG allergy case reports from 1977 until February 2022 was performed, using the electronic biomedical literature databases PubMed, compromising citations from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books (Table 1). Unconnected Keywords used were "PEG allergy", "PEG and anaphylaxis", and "PEG allergy and testing". Single case reports of PEG allergy, for the period 1977-2016, were already summarized in the review by Wenande and Garvey and not separately listed.1 References of the obtained articles were examined for cross references. The search was limited to articles in English, French, and German.
Articles reporting about the topic percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy were excluded from the data. In addition, cases covering pegasparaginase allergy were not included in the data, as in the majority of those patients are allergic to the asparaginase rather than the PEG-moiety.12,13
COVID-19 vaccine allergy cases were only included when further diagnostics (skin testing, oral provocation) proved a PEG allergy and not allergic reactions to an unknown culprit. Electronic medical records about PEG allergy or PEG allergy cases diagnosed by primary care providers without a further allergological work up were not included.14,15
RESULTS
Google data
We included 741 vaccination-related keywords, which resulted in 134 433 230 queries over the last 4 years in Germany (Fig. 1a), including all vaccination related terms. The average interest in the topic vaccination was 561 108 queries per month February 2018 until January 2020 (Fig. 2a). An increase in search volume started in February 2020, parallel to the first COVID-19 case in Germany. Search volume remained stable until December 2020, the approval of the first

COVID-19 vaccination. Since then, search queries immensely increased up to a maximum of 22 291 480 queries in May 2021, 39-times higher than in the timeframe before COVID-19 pandemic. The maximum monthly search volume even increased up to 57-fold. Certain events such as the STIKO recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination or revaccination seemed to influence search volume more than actual COVID-19 infection numbers.
The search term "adverse effects and vaccination" resulted in 21 313 650 queries (Fig. 1a). In the first two years (February 2018 until January 2020), the total search volume of 1 448 430 queries was low compared to the last 2 years with a total search volume of 19 865 220 representing an increase of 13.7 times (Fig. 2b). Thereby a maximum monthly increase of 85-fold comparing March 2018 and May 2021 took place. Almost half of these queries were for PEG-containing vaccines such as BioNTech (n ¼ 6 869 180) and Moderna (n ¼ 2 266 270).
The 290 510 Google search queries for the terms "allergy and vaccination", with a maximum monthly increase from July 2018 to May 2021 of 71-fold, were further categorized in "allergy to a COVID-19 Vaccination", increased from zero up to a sum of 100 010 queries following December 2020 (Fig. 3a). "Allergy to PEG containing vaccines" and "PEG allergy" resulted in 64 700 queries.
The topic vaccination with a coexisting allergy, such as hay fever, was covered by 57 420 queries (Fig. 1a) in the 4 years. Before the pandemic, the search volume increased during the hay fever season, particularly in the months February until June 2019 and 2020 (average n ¼ 216/month) compared to the remaining months (n ¼ 61/ month) (Fig. 3b). Thereafter, parallel to the 2020 vaccination start, the number of queries increased by 32-fold from 1510 queries in 2019 to 48 880 in 2021.
An even more drastic increase occurred with the 55 970 PEG allergy-related search queries (Fig. 4), of which only 250 occurred before February 2020. Overall, 44 230 search queries belonged to the disease category PEG allergy and 11 740 were related to PEG allergy testing, a search term not being searched before December 2020.

Table 1. (Continued) Case reports of patients with PEG allergy in the period 1977-February 2022 aThis review summarises all cases reported from 1977 to 2015. bSame PEG patients compared to previous publication.

PubMed data
Seven hundred twelve scientific worldwide PubMed publications for "PEG allergy" (n ¼ 510), "PEG and anaphylaxis" (n ¼ 97) and "PEG allergy and testing" (n ¼ 105) from 1977 to 2022 exist (Fig. 5, Table 1). The release of PEG containing COVID19 vaccination went along with a 3.5-fold increase of publications on "PEG allergy" in 2021 compared to 2018 (Fig. 5).
The search term, "PEG allergy and anaphylaxis", retrieved a peak in 2021 rising to >6.7 times; "PEG allergy and testing" did not show any increase in publication numbers.
Two hundred eleven cases with a diagnosed PEG allergy were found from 1977 until 2022 (Table 1). Ninety-eight patients were female, 77 male; no gender was given in 36 cases. Age ranged from 2 to 87 years. Wenande and Garvey already summarized 37 case reports starting 1977 until 2016;1 therefore, we did not list these case reports separately. Stone and colleagues summarized another 53 PEG allergy cases.3 As far as possible, we tried not to list identical cases in more than one report or follow-ups twice. In almost all cases (n ¼ 211) anaphylaxis due to PEG was reported. Overall 97 PEG allergy case published before the market introduction of PEG containing vaccines and 114 thereafter.

DISCUSSION
Google search volumes show an exponentially rising public interest in PEG allergy starting with the introduction of COVID-19 vaccination in Germany. Scientific publications on PEG allergy and PEG anaphylaxis, probably supported by public awareness, have only mildly increased 2.5- and 6.8-fold in 2021 worldwide compared to 2019. In strong contrast, only 211 PEG allergy cases have been known since 1977. Thus, the risk for patients without a typical allergic history remains negligible. German public interest in PEG allergy does not reconcile with the few PEG allergy case numbers published worldwide. The data thereby testify the public lack of knowledge on PEG allergy resulting in a current high demand for allergy testing before COVID-19 vaccination.
The outbreak of COVID-19 has left the world in a unique state of crisis leading to an unprecedented mass vaccination. The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccination induced German public concern about its safety, being reflected by an increase in Google search volumes. Search results for "vaccination" increased up to 39-fold, "adverse effects of vaccination" up to 14-fold. One hundred thousand ten search results were placed for "allergy to a COVID-19 vaccination" after the vaccination announcement, and 64 700 looked specifically into allergy to vaccination containing

PEG. Before COVID-19 vaccination there was a negligible search volume for PEG allergy; it increased dramatically after March 2021, when AstraZeneca's vaccine was temporarily halted and a general recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination was released. This is interesting, because AstraZeneca's vaccine does not include PEG. However, media coverage, not even concerning PEG including vaccines, but rather COVID-19 vaccination in general, and political interventions, seem the main drivers of public interest, also shown in previous studies,10,16 and the actual

number of COVID-19 infections seem to play a subsidiary minor role.
PubMed case reports demonstrate a preexisting low scientific interest in PEG allergy before the pandemic worldwide with only few research papers and few case reports. Although this significantly peaked since the release of COVID-19 vaccines, coverage already had started to increase in 2016. PEG was already approved as a laxative since 1980 and nowadays is increasingly used in a huge variety of different medications and cosmetic

products.6 In contrast, the prevalence of PEG allergy case reports is as low as 211 cases in PubMed, although there has been a substantial increase of patient numbers in the last two years. Before that, PEG allergy was likely to be underreported,17 as it might had been a "hidden allergen" not known to physicians and

patients.1,3,17 It is likely that the broad media
coverage of anaphylactic cases triggered public
awareness for allergic reactions to vaccination and focusing on PEG as a possible culprit.18 In
the beginning the reported allergy rate appears to be 2-4 times higher than expected for other vaccinations,2 however new data show

comparable anaphylaxis rates associated with COVID-19 vaccines to those of other vaccines, even ranking fifth in reported anaphylaxis rates, behind rabies, tick-borne encephalitis, measlesmumps-rubella-varicella, and human papillomavirus vaccines.5 The rarity of PEG allergy (<220 cases worldwide) strongly argues against a causal relationship for most cases with anaphylaxis and COVID-19 vaccination,2 especially considering PEG being used in up to 1 million times higher concentrations in laxatives than it is used in vaccination.8
Furthermore, studies on allergic reactions to PEGcontaining vaccines failed to identify PEG as the culprit in most cases.2,19,20 In these, re-vaccinations were normally well tolerated.21-25 In a Danish study with 199 377 vaccinated patients, only 0.03%

reported allergic reactions and of those only 3 had evidence for an allergy to ingredients of the vaccine after testing.20 Additionally, several cases
were reported where people with a known PEG allergy could be safely vaccinated.2,26 Other
reasons for the higher number of reported allergylike reactions following COVID-19 vaccination
remain unknown. Furthermore, the reported allergies have highly subjective symptoms which may
be explained at least partly through vasovagal or non-immune mediated mechanisms.27 Public concerns might have driven anxiety and
somatoform reactions, which may often not be distinguished from allergic reactions. The majority
of people suspecting a PEG allergy before or after vaccination and wanting an allergological
consultation did not have a clinical indication for allergological workup.2,19,20

Furthermore, data showed a low seasonal interest in vaccination safety and coexisting allergy before the pandemic. In 2021, after pandemic started, this topic increased more than 32-fold compared to 2019 with no seasonal influences any more. For people having allergies there seems to be a high need for information especially on COVID-19 vaccination safety. This is also backed up by our experience in our clinical department.
Limitations concerning this study are the use of German Google data representing only a subpopulation using Google for medical questions. Because Google AdWords Keyword Planner does not provide information on the user's demographics, no information about the examined population is available. The data only analyses German Google data. The situation may have been somewhat different in other industrialized countries, but exemplifies in Germany the disproportional public interest in PEG allergy, being strongly influenced by vaccine approvals, political recommendations or warnings concerning COVID-19, and spread of the COVID-19 infection. A further limitation might be the automatic completion of search terms provided by Google, which might bias people's search behavior. The interest in PEG allergy might be underestimated because not all patients suspecting an allergy consulted the internet. Furthermore, people might have searched with unspecific questions, not included in the specific google key terms. Additionally, PubMed PEG allergy case reports may not represent all existing PEG allergy cases. There might be an underreporting or a time delay. Due to a lack of knowledge on PEG allergy, previous PEG allergies before the pandemic might have been underdiagnosed.
CONCLUSION
German public interest in vaccination and PEG allergy strongly coincided with COVID-19 vaccine approval, heavy media coverage of the rare reports of anaphylaxis following COVID-19 vaccination and health authority recommendation for vaccination, even more than by the number of COVID-19 infections. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, PEG allergy was nearly unknown in the German population. This is especially interesting considering PEG's widespread and long-

lasting use in medicine and other preparations. The scientific community always have had some low-level interest in PEG allergy, which already increased after 2016 but significantly peaked after the PEG-containing vaccination availability. Although the numbers of patients with a reported PEG allergy substantially increased in the last 2 years, absolute numbers still remain low. Thus, the overrun of allergy departments by patients asking for PEG allergy testing is not and has never been medically justified. Scientific easily accessible and understandable online information about the very low frequency of PEG allergy seems of very great importance and need.

60 Abstract 61 Background 62 It remains unclear if patients with AR and/or asthma are susceptible to COVID-19 infection, 63 severity and mortality. 64 Objective
Journal Pre-proof 65 To investigate the role of AR and/or asthma in COVID-19 infection, severity, and mortality,
66 and assess whether long-term AR and/or asthma medications affected the outcomes of COVID67 19. 68 Methods 69 Demographic and clinical data of 70,557 adult participants completed SARS-Cov-2 testing 70 between March 16 and December 31, 2020 in the UK Biobank were analyzed. The rates of 71 COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and mortality in relation to preexisting AR and/or asthma 72 were assessed based on adjusted generalized linear models. We further analyzed the impact of 73 long-term AR and/or asthma medications on the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and 74 mortality. 75 Results 76 AR patients of all ages had lower positive rates of SARS-Cov-2 tests (RR:0.75, 95% CI: 0.6977 0.81, p<0.001), with lower susceptibility in males (RR: 0.74, 95%CI: 0.65-0.85, p<0.001) than 78 females (RR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.72-0.9, p<0.001). However, similar effects of asthma against 79 COVID-19 hospitalization were only major in participants aged <65 (RR:0.93, 95% CI: 0.8680 1, p=0.044) instead of elderlies. In contrast, asthma patients tested positively had higher risk
3

81 of hospitalization (RR:1.42, 95% CI: 1.32-1.54, p<0.001). Neither AR nor asthma had impact

82 on COVID-19 mortality. None of conventional medications for AR or asthma, e.g.,

83 antihistamines, corticosteroids or 2 adrenoceptor agonists showed association with COVID-

84 19 infection or severity.

85 Conclusion

Journal Pre-proof 86

AR (all ages) and asthma (aged<65) act as protective factors against COVID-19 infection,

87 while asthma increase risk for COVID-19 hospitalization. None of the long-term medications

88 had significant association with infection, severity and mortality of COVID-19 among patients

89 with AR and/or asthma.

108 Highlight Box 109 What is already known about this topic? 110 In different studies, whether asthma and allergic rhinitis acting as independent risk factors for 111 COVID-19 remains controversial. 112 What does this article add to our knowledge? 113 AR (all ages) and asthma (aged<65) act as protective factors against COVID-19 infection, 114 while asthma increase the risk for hospitalization. None of the long-term medications had 115 significant association with infection, severity and mortality of COVID-19 among patients with 116 AR and/or asthma. 117 How does this study impact current management guidelines 118 We provided new insights on the association between allergic diseases and COVID-19 119 prevalence and outcomes. We suggested more attention should be paid to the education and 120 primary care of elderly asthmatic patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including active 121 treatment of comorbidities.

122 Introduction

123 The emergence of COVID-19 has had a huge impact on population health globally. As of

124 May 9th, 2021, there have been more than 157 million confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide

125 and over 3.2 million deaths were attributed to the pandemic (https://covid19.who.int./). It has

126 been reported that some underlying diseases such as dementia, pneumonia, depression, diabetes,

Journal Pre-proof 127 atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension[1], as well

128 as high cytokine, lactate dehydrogenase level[2] and ages could affect the prevalence and

129 outcomes of COVID-19.

130

Allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma are common and underestimated respiratory diseases

131 and often simultaneously occur as united airway disease[3-5]. Whether AR and asthma acting as

132 independent risk factor for the infection, hospitalization and mortality of COVID-19 remains

133 controversial. It was reported that AR/asthma patients were often exacerbated by viral

134 respiratory infections[6, 7]. A Korean nationwide cohort study reported that AR and asthma

135 increased the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19[8]. On the contrary, other reports

136 suggested that asthma did not pose a threat to the diagnosis and severity of COVID-19[9-12].

137 Moreover, some meta-analyses even concluded that asthma was considered as an independent

138 protective factor for the death of patients with COVID-19[13-15].

139

Our current study aimed to explore the role of AR and/or asthma in the risk of infection,

140 severity and mortality of COVID-19 based on a large prospective cohort in UK Biobank, and

141 to evaluate whether long-term medications for AR and/or asthma would affect the clinical

142 manifestation and outcomes of COVID-19.

143 Methods

144 Database information

145

UK Biobank (UKB) is a national prospective cohort with very large and detailed data from

146 over 500,000 participants aged 40-69 years when recruited at baseline (in 2006-2010), which

147 ensured a wide distribution across all exposures to provide reliable associations between

Journal Pre-proof 148 personal characteristics and health outcomes[16]. SARS-Cov-2 testing results data were offered

149 to UKB by Public Health England (PHE). UK Biobank ethical approval was from the North

150 West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee. The current analysis was approved under the

151 UKB application (Applicant Number: 69718).

152 Study population

153

UKB participants with matching SARS-Cov-2 results (whether reported as positive or

154 negative for SARS-Cov-2) tested between March 16th 2020 and December 31st, 2020 in

155 England were examined. We excluded individuals with 1) who died before the pandemic (set

156 as February 1st, 2020); 2) whose location belonged to UKB assessment centers in Scotland and

157 Wales (where no SARS-CoV-2 testing data were available); and 3) who were diagnosed with

158 AR and/or asthma after February 1st, 2020, which was set as the beginning of the pandemic[1].

159 Exposure variables and covariables

160

AR was defined as either self-reported AR history from baseline questionnaires or the

161 International Classification of Diseases codes (ICD-10 codes: J30.1, J30.2, J30.3, J30.4; or

162 ICD-9 codes: 460,477). Asthma was defined as either self-reported asthma history from

163 baseline questionnaires or ICD codes (ICD-10 codes: J45; or ICD-9 codes: 493).

7

164

Medication data of UK Biobank participants were available from a verbal interview by a

165 trained nurse on prescription medications including type and number of medications. The long-

166 term medications were defined as regular medications taken weekly and monthly, as opposed

167 to the short-term medications. We summarized different types of medications such as

168 antihistamine, glucocorticoids, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and 2 adrenoceptor agonists

Journal Pre-proof 169 according to their coding in Table E1.

170

Covariables included gender, age, Townsend deprivation index, education, body mass

171 index (BMI), ethnic background, smoking status, alcohol drinking status, current employment

172 status and preexisting comorbidities[1, 17]. Age was defined as baseline age plus the duration of

173 interval before inclusion. Preexisting comorbidities considered in this study included cancer

174 diagnosed by doctor (self-report in questionnaires), fracture resulting from simple fall (self-

175 report in questionnaires), diabetes mellitus (ICD-10 codes E10, E11, E12, E13, E14), chronic

176 diseases of the circulatory system (ICD-10 codes I05-I09, I10-I15, I20-I25, I26-I28, I60-I69),

177 chronic lower respiratory diseases (ICD-10 codes J40, J41, J42, J43, J44, J47 or ICD-9 codes

178 490, 491, 492, 496, 494), diseases of esophagus, stomach and duodenum (ICD-10 codes K20,

179 K21, K25, K26, K27, K28, K29, K30 or ICD-9 codes 530, 531, 532, 533, 534, 535, 5368),

180 renal failure (ICD-10 codes N17, N18, N19 or ICD-9 codes 584, 585), dementia (ICD-10 codes

181 F00, F01, F02, F03, G30 or ICD-9 codes 2901), liver disease (K72 Hepatic failure, not

182 elsewhere classified, K74, 5712, 5715, 5716 fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver), arthritis (ICD-10

183 codes M00, M01, M02, M03, M05, M06, M07, M08, M09, M10, M11, M12, M13, M14) and

184 certain immune disorders (ICD-10 codes D80, D81, D82, D83, D84, D86, D89). However, due

8

185 to the limited number of patients who had liver diseases (n=609, less than 1%), we excluded

186 liver disease when doing the adjustment.

187 Outcomes

188

The definition of COVID-19 infection referred to at least one positive testing result of

189 SARS-CoV-2. When exploring the severity and mortality of COVID-19, we focused on the

Journal Pre-proof 190 participants who had confirmed COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-positive patients who progressed

191 to hospitalization were considered as "severe COVID-19"[10]. To identify patients died of

192 COVID-19, we used mortality data provided by UK Biobank using the ICD10 identifier of

193 U07.1 (underlying COVID-19 cause of death).

194 Statistics analyses

195

Continuous variables were presented as mean and standard deviation (SD), and categorical

196 variables were presented as frequencies and percentages. Student's t-test was used for

197 continuous variable comparisons and chi-square test for categorical variable comparisons in

198 order to assess the differences among groups. Generalized linear models (robust Poisson model)

199 were generated to evaluate the correlation of AR and/or asthma with COVID-19 outcomes

200 (including prevalence, hospitalization rate and mortality), shown as relative risks (RRs) and

201 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Smoking status consisted of two variables: smoking

202 experience, categorized as current, former, and never smoker; and pack year, defined as the

203 product of the average number of cigarette packs (regular size, 20 cigarettes) smoked per day

204 and the total number of years smoked. According to the variable distribution, observation value

205 and association of smoking participants[18], multiple imputation using chained equations that

9

206 provided multiple predictions for each missing value had been conducted to impute the missing

207 data of smoking pack year (n=11,391).

208

Four models were constructed according to the adjustments of factors: i. Model* was a

209 univariate model without adjustment; ii. Model** adjusted gender and age additionally; iii.

210 Model*** was further adjusted for potential confounders, including Townsend deprivation

Journal Pre-proof 211 index, education, current employment status, BMI, ethnic background, smoking and drinking

212 status; iv. Model**** added preexisting comorbidities mentioned above as adjustments based

213 on Model***. Above four models were analyzed simultaneously for AR group, asthma group,

214 AR and asthma group, respectively, and the reference was the healthy control group for all

215 relevant analyses.

216

Medication analyses were conducted for participants who had either AR or asthma, and

217 participants who had AR or asthma but never used those medicines served as the controls in

218 corresponding analysis.

219

For subgroup analyses, Model**** was constructed for participants stratified by gender

220 (female or male), age (< 65 or 65 years old), BMI (30 or >30), ethnic background (white

221 or non-white) and smoking (never, previous or current). Preexisting dementia was reported to

222 be associated with dramatically increasing risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and death (OR =

223 7.30)[1] due to the APOE e4 genotype[19], hence sensitivity analysis was conducted for

224 participants without dementia to assess the robustness of our results.

225

In order to conduct a more in-depth analysis for asthma, asthma participants were further

226 divided into allergic asthma and non-allergic asthma groups, and the Model**** was applied

10

227 for the sub-analysis. Allergic asthma was defined as asthma with any allergic disease (hayfever,

228 allergy rhinitis or eczema, defined as ICD-10 codes: L20 and J30.1-J30.4 or self-report in

229 questionnaires)[10], and non-allergic asthma referred to asthma without any allergic disease. The

230 reference was healthy control group without asthma or allergic diseases. In another sub-

231 analysis, we explored the differences in the outcomes of COVID-19 between asthma patients

Journal Pre-proof 232 with/without COPD (COPD was defined as the following ICD-10 codes: J43, J44 or self-

233 report in questionnaires) and participants without asthma or COPD (reference group).

234

All analyses were performed by R 3.6.3 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria), and

235 P < 0.05 was considered for statistical significance.

11

236 Results

237 Patient characteristics

238

As shown in Table 1 and Table E2, there were 70,557 participants tested SARS-CoV-2,

239 and 15,690 of them had at least one SARS-CoV-2 positive test. Among them, 4,915 patients

240 were hospitalized due to the COVID-19, and 636 patients died of COVID-19. For analysis, we

Journal Pre-proof 241 classified all participants into four groups of AR only (n=3,201), asthma only (n=8,624), AR

242 and asthma (n=1,407), and control (neither AR nor asthma, n=57,325). The mean age of

243 COVID-19 patients was 64.4 years, versus 68.7 years for those with non-COVID-19. Similarly,

244 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (mean age: 68 years vs. 62.8 years of non-hospitalized

245 patients) or COVID-19-related death (mean age: 74 years vs. 64 years of non-death patients)

246 were more likely to occur in the older participants than the younger, respectively.

247 The effect of AR and asthma on the infection of COVID-19

248

As shown in Table 2 and Figure 1, AR represented a protective effect against COVID-19

249 infection (RR: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.69-0.81, p<0.001), and this benefit was consistently observed

250 (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.71-0.85, p<0.001) after adjustment for gender, age, Townsend

251 deprivation index, education, current employment status, BMI, ethnic background, smoking

252 status and alcohol drinking status, and preexisting comorbidities by Model****. The protective

253 effect of AR on COVID-19 infection was similar if patients had comorbid asthma (RR: 0.81,

254 95% CI: 0.73-0.92, p=0.001). However, the protective effect of asthma alone against the

255 COVID-19 infection was not significant after adjustment (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.01,

256 p=0.109). Table E3 reported the association of AR and/or asthma with COVID-19 infection,

12

257 hospitalization and mortality, after adjustment for different covariates.

258 The effect of AR and asthma on the severity and mortality of COVID-19

259

As shown in Table 2, among those participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 test, AR did not

260 significantly affect the hospitalization rate of COVID-19 after covariate adjustments (RR: 0.95,

261 95% CI: 0.79-1.13, p=0.548). On the contrary, asthma was a risk factor for the COVID-19

Journal Pre-proof 262 hospitalization (RR: 1.1, 95% CI: 1.01-1.19, p=0.032). Neither AR nor asthma had a significant

263 effect on COVID-19 mortality after covariate adjustments for Townsend deprivation index,

264 education, employment, BMI, ethnic background, smoking status, drinking status and

265 preexisting comorbidities.

266 The effects of long-term medications for AR and/or asthma on infection, hospitalization

267 and mortality of COVID-19.

268

We summarized four main long-term medication types that patients commonly used for

269 control symptoms of AR or asthma, including 2 adrenoceptor agonists, antihistamine,

270 systemic glucocorticoids, and corticosteroid nasal sprays (CNS). As shown in Table 3 and

271 Figure 2, due to the limited sample size (Table E4), none of these medications showed

272 significant impact on infection, severity and mortality of COVID-19 among patients with AR

273 and/or asthma.

274

We further conducted subgroup analyses for the most commonly used types of CNS

275 (beclomethasone and fluticasone propionate), short-acting 2 adrenoceptor agonists (SABA)

276 and long-acting 2 adrenoceptor agonists (LABA), shown in Table E5. However, due to the

277 limited number of COVID-19 patients taking certain medicines chronically, none of these were

13

278 associated with the infection, hospitalization or mortality of COVID-19 after adjustments for
279 other covariates (p>0.05). 280 Subgroup analyses for different clinical factors potentially affecting the infection and 281 severity of COVID-19

282

As shown in Table E6, we evaluated the effects of different covariates on the infection,

Journal Pre-proof 283 severity and mortality of COVID-19. Our results revealed that preexisting comorbidities (such

284 as dementia, circulatory diseases, etc) were important variables that affecting the infection and

285 severity of COVID-19 (Model****).

286

We further carried out multivariable subgroup analyses for the factors of gender, age, BMI,

287 ethnics and smoking status to explore their individual effects on the infection and severity of

288 COVID-19 (Table E7). With respect to COVID-19 infection and hospitalization, it was worth

289 noting that when stratified participants by ages, asthma demonstrated a potential protective

290 effect against COVID-19 infection in younger participants (aged<65 years, RR: 0.93, 95% CI:

291 0.86-1, p=0.044), but this effect on the elderly participants was not significant (aged65

292 years,RR:1.02, 95% CI: 0.95-1.1, p=0.59). Compared with those never or previous smokers,

293 current smokers with AR and asthma had a higher risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization

294 (RR:1.98, 95% CI: 1-3.9, p=0.049). 295 Sub-analyses for Patients with Asthma

296

We further compared the differences in COVID-19 infection/outcomes between patients

297 with allergic and non-allergic asthma (Table E8) and between asthma patients with and without

298 COPD (Table E9), respectively. No significant difference between allergic and non-allergic

299 asthma was observed in our results. In line with the above results, both of them reduced the

14

300 infection risk of COVID-19, while neither of them presented significant association with the

301 COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality. Asthma patients without COPD had a slightly

302 protective effect against COVID-19 infection, but such patients had an increased

303 hospitalization risk of COVID-19.

304

305 Sensitivity Analysis

Journal Pre-proof 306

Some studies have shown that dementia had a striking association with COVID-19 related

307 hospitalizations and deaths[1]. We therefore performed sensitivity analyses by excluding

308 participants with preexisting dementia (n=1,876) to evaluate the robustness of our results

309 (Table E10). We observed consistent results that participants with AR (with/without asthma)

310 had lower risk of COVID-19 infection, however, asthma patients with positive SARS-CoV-2

311 had higher risk of progression to hospitalized COVID-19.

314 Discussion

315

After evaluating 70,557 participants in UKB, our results showed that AR was a major

316 protective factor from infecting COVID-19 after covariate adjustments. Asthma also showed a

317 weak association with lower COVID-19 infection risk although it did not reach a statistical

318 significance. It is noteworthy that this trend of asthma on COVID-19 infection was driven

Journal Pre-proof 319 primarily in younger participants (aged<65 years), but not in the elderly participants (aged

320 65 years). Nonetheless, having a diagnosis of asthma was associated with a greater chance of

321 COVID-19 hospitalization across all ages, even after covariate adjustments, whereas AR had

322 no impact on COVID-19 hospitalizations. Although it is hard to make firm conclusions due to

323 the limited number of deaths related to COVID-19, neither AR nor asthma was associated with

324 COVID-19 mortality. None of the long-term medications for AR/asthma had some effects on

325 the infection, hospitalization and mortality of COVID-19 after covariate adjustments.

326

We consider the reason why patients with AR (of all ages) or asthma (among younger

327 participants) were associated with lower positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 test results. Angiotensin-

328 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for the attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into

329 the host cells[20]. It has been reported that allergen provocation of respiratory tract would induce

330 allergic airway inflammation which resulted in a decrease of ACE-2 expression, indicating that

331 allergic inflammation may of great relevance to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection[11, 21, 22].

332 In addition, allergen-specific T cells may recruit a faster and more efficient memory-type

333 response to deal with heterologous SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, which may provide significant

334 advantages for patients with allergic diseases[23, 24]. However, this protective effect of asthma

16

335 on COVID-19 infection was mainly observed in patients who were younger than 65 years in

336 our study. The exact reason is unclear but we speculated that it might attribute to the decline in

337 lung function and immunity with age[25], which could lead to poorer prognoses[26, 27].

338

It is interesting that AR and asthma exhibited distinct effects on COVID-19 hospitalization

339 in our study, of which asthma was a risk factor while the influence of AR was not statistically
Journal Pre-proof 340 notable. One potential reason is that SARS-CoV-2 impacts the lung parenchyma, so the
341 additional impact of lower airway disease with asthma (and not with AR) could lead to a 342 synergistically worsened clinical condition (i.e. rapid deterioration)[28], further, asthma patients 343 may have more pulmonary comorbidities which affect the disease outcomes. By contrast, AR 344 (upper airways) is a disease more confined to the nose. Consistent with the findings here, some 345 studies have also proposed that if SARS-CoV-2 succeeded to establish clinical manifestations 346 in patients with asthma, the risk of disease progression is higher[23]. The possible reasons given 347 in these studies are as the following: 1) respiratory viruses provoke the local inflammatory 348 cascades processed by T-lymphocyte trafficking, and induce the disruption of the bronchial 349 defense system activated by resident monocytes[29]. 2) respiratory viruses can change the

350 composition of the airway microbiota and promote the growth of pathogens which may

351 contribute to asthma exacerbations[30].(3) decreased antiviral function of eosinophils during

352 respiratory viral infections in asthmatic patients may have a potential impact on virus-induced

353 asthma exacerbations[31].

354

Bloom et al. analyzed the data from Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK)

355 study and revealed that compared with patients without asthma, asthma patients with COVID-

17

356 19 were more likely to receive critical care during hospitalization[32]. Several independent

357 studies have observed a potential association between asthma phenotypes and COVID-19-

358 related outcomes. According to the results of Zhu et al., nonallergic asthma was significantly

359 associated with severe COVID-19, while allergic asthma had no statistically significant

360 association with severe COVID-19. They also reported that this significant association

Journal Pre-proof 361 persisted regardless of whether asthma patients had COPD or not[10]. However, we did not

362 observe such differences between allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. Although our research data

363 came from the same UK Biobank database, the confounders we adjusted for and the

364 populations we included were different. In our current study, we excluded participants who did

365 not have SARS-cov-2 testing results, while these participants were considered as SARS-cov-2

366 negative in their study.

367

Another English cohort study (QResearch database) reported that COVID-19 patients with

368 COPD or asthma had an increased risk of hospitalization and death[33]. However, our results

369 did not observe such trends, mainly due to the different population cohort we studied. Another

370 Chinese study indicated that COPD and asthma were both important risk factors for poor

371 clinical outcomes (such as needing invasive ventilation, admission to the intensive care unit,

372 or death within 30 days after hospitalization) in patients with COVID-19[34]. In contrast, our

373 results showed statistically significant relationships only between the hospitalization rate of

374 COVID-19 and asthma comorbidity.

375

The effect of glucocorticoid on the risk of susceptibility, severity and mortality of COVID-

376 19 was controversial. Recent studies reported that glucocorticoid such as ciclesonide might

18

377 decrease the risk of susceptibility of COVID-19[35-37]. However, our results did not observe that

378 long-term use of antihistamine, systemic glucocorticoids or glucocorticoid nasal sprays was

379 beneficial to the COVID-19 infection or prognosis. Similarly, Aveyard et al. reported that the

380 use of glucocorticoids was not associated with the severity of COVID-19[33]. And Schultze et

381 al. also reported that long-term use of glucocorticoids would not reduce COVID-19-related

Journal Pre-proof 382 mortality in patients with asthma or COPD[38].

383

Although the advent of our study provided new insights into the association between

384 allergic diseases and the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19, a few limitations still existed.

385 First, the UKB may have a healthy volunteer selection bias in participants subgroups who were

386 older, female, or lived in less socioeconomically deprived areas[39]. Second, the sample size for

387 assessing COVID-19 related mortality in AR/asthma patients who had taken long-term

388 medications was very small (126/2624), limiting our study power to detect differences related

389 to medication use. Third, comorbidity data of participants were obtained from the baseline

390 interviews and hospitalization information, but the current status of diseases remained

391 unknown; the impact on our association is unknown, as some patients could have already taken

392 off medications once remission has been achieved, while others had flare ups of their disease

393 during the pandemic period. Fourthly, we have to use an imperfect surrogate for severity of

394 COVID-19, namely COVID-19 hospitalizations, knowing that some patients with severe

395 diseases may have been assumed to have COVID-19 infection and not tested, while some

396 hospitalizations may have been misclassified due to other major disorders rather than COVID-

397 19. Finally, our analyses did not take into account changes in participant behaviour. It is thus

19

398 still possible that participants with AR or younger asthmatic patients were either more careful

399 about their own COVID-19 exposures or more afraid to present with COVID-19-like

400 symptoms, and therefore were more likely to wear masks or adhere to social distancing.

401

In summary, AR (in all ages) is associated with lower rates of COVID-19 infection, but

402 not with the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Similar protective effect in asthma patients,
Journal Pre-proof 403 whatever allergic asthma or non-allergic asthma is observed only in those aged less than 65
404 years, but not in the elderlies (aged 65 years). In asthmatic patients with confirmed COVID405 19, there is a higher risk of hospitalization than healthy controls.

ABSTRACT
Background: Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) is known to affect the heart and is associated with a proinflammatory state. Most studies to date have focused on clinically sick subjects. Here, we report cardiac and proinflammatory biomarkers levels in ambulatory young adults with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection compared to those without infection 4-8 weeks after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCOV-2) testing. Methods: 131 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic subjects were enrolled following testing for SARS-COV-2. Fifty subjects tested negative, and 81 subjects tested positive. Serum samples were collected for measurement of C-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin-6, NT-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and cardiac troponin 28-55 days after SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR testing. Results: Biomarker levels trended higher in SARS-COV-2-positive vs negative subjects, but differences in biomarker levels or proportion of subjects with elevated biomarkers were not statistically significant with respect to SARS-COV-2 status. Among individuals with  1 comorbidity, odds of elevated CRP were greater compared to individuals without any comorbidities (odds ratio [OR] = 2.90); this effect size was increased 1.4-fold among SARS-COV-2-positive subjects (OR = 4.03). Similarly, NT-pro-BNP was associated with CVD, with the strongest association in COVID-positive individuals (OR = 16.9). Conclusions: In a relatively young, healthy adult population, mild COVID-19 infection was associated with mild elevations in cardiac and proinflammatory biomarkers within 4-8 weeks of mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in individuals with preexisting comorbidities, but not among individuals without comorbidities. For the general population of young adults, we did not find evidence of elevation of cardiac or proinflammatory biomarkers 4-8 weeks after COVID-19 infection. Clinical Perspective: This is a characterization of cardiac and proinflammatory biomarkers in ambulatory subjects following asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection. Young, ambulatory individuals did not have cardiac and proinflammatory biomarker elevation 4-8 weeks after mild COVID-19 infection. However, COVID19 infection was associated with biomarker elevations in select individuals with comorbidities. Clinical study number: H-47423.

1. Introduction

2.5. Definitions of elevated biomarkers

Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), the infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, presents as an upper respiratory tract infection, and can progress to pulmonary infection (i.e., pneumonia), acute respiratory distress syndrome or systemic infection in some subjects [1,2]. Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 has been documented [3] and can manifest in several ways [4,5]. Cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers have been reported to be elevated in acute COVID-19 infection, especially among individuals requiring hospitalization and intensive care unit [5,6]. Ele­ vations in cardiac troponins and NT-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are associated with increased risks of re-hospitalization, CV complications and death after COVID-19 infection [7].
However, most studies of COVID-19 serum biomarkers, particularly cardiac biomarkers, have been reported in hospitalized COVID-19 pa­ tients [8]. The role of cardiac biomarkers in young, ambulatory adults following a COVID-19 infection remains unclear. To this end, we compared cardiac and proinflammatory biomarker elevations between 81 COVID-19-positive cases and 50 COVID-19-negative control subjects during an 8-week follow-up period.
2. Methods
2.1. Study population
All studies on human subjects were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Baylor College of Medicine (approval number H47423). Ambulatory adults (18-49 years-of-age) who were evaluated at Baylor College of Medicine outpatient clinics or affiliate institutions and had undergone SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR tests between 18 March and 15 August 2020 were included in the study. Subjects with severe COVID-19 symptoms including those requiring hospitalization were excluded from the study, along with children 17 years of age and younger and pregnant women.
2.2. SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR
Samples for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing were collected by midturbinate or nasopharyngeal swab. Viral RNA was extracted using the Qiagen Viral RNA MiniKit (Qiagen Sciences) and were tested by CDC 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-ncoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic panel with primers and probes targeting the nucleocapsid genes, N1 and N2, as previously described [9]. Cycle threshold (Ct) values < 40 for both N1 and N2 primers were considered positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
2.3. Biomarker quantification
Blood samples were collected during a follow-up visit 28-55 days (median 36 days, interquartile range 14 days) after the SARS-CoV-2 RTPCR test. All laboratory results were obtained using laboratory analyzers (Vitros 5600 and Architect i1000).

A list of biomarkers tested with normal ranges is shown in Supple­ mentary Table 1. Elevated CRP was defined as greater than or equal to 5.0 mg/L based on the standard reference range for the standard (i.e., not high-sensitivity) CRP assay [10]. Elevated ferritin was defined by conventional clinical cutoffs - greater than 300 ng/mL for males and 200 ng/mL for females [11]. Elevated IL-6 was defined as greater than 25 pg/mL, which has been shown to be an independent risk factor for progression of COVID-19 and in-hospital mortality [12]. Elevated NTpro-BNP was defined as greater than 125 pg/mL in line with the cutoff used for adults younger than 75 years-old [13]. Elevated troponin was defined as greater than 0.01 ng/mL in accordance with threshold of 99th percentile levels in comparable population studies [14,15].
2.6. Statistical analyses
Data are represented as percentages or mean +/- standard error of the mean (SEM). All statistical analyses were performed using RStudio 1.4.1717. Two-sample independent t-tests were used to compare quan­ titative data. Chi-square tests were used to compare qualitative data. Fisher's exact tests were used in lieu of chi-square tests when expected counts were less than five. Logistic regression was performed using generalized estimating equations to account for confounding variables in testing for the association between predictor variables and a dichot­ omous outcome variable. All logistic regression analyses were adjusted for age and carried out using the logit link function. For all statistical analyses, two-sided P values<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Demographic and clinical characteristics
Demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1 by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing status. The overall sample consisted of 131 participants, including 50 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative controls (mean age 31 years, 52 % female) and 81 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive cases (mean age 30 years, 58 % female). As shown in Table 1, age (P = 6.86E03) and race (P = 0.034) were the only demographic characteristics that differed statistically significantly between SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive cases and negative controls. There was a higher representation of White patients in the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative cohort compared to SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR positive cohort (80 % versus 57 %), but other race or ethnicity proportions did not differ significantly between SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative and positive cohorts. Presence of any preexisting co­ morbidity was similar by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative and positive status (40 % in COVID-19-negative and 34 % in COVID-19-positive).
All cases included in this study were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals treated as outpatients or discharged from the emergency department and had SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive testing. Controls were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals that were treated as outpatients or discharged from the emergency depart­ ment and had SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative testing.

2.4. Definition of comorbidities

3.2. Correlation of elevated biomarkers with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection

History of comorbidities were collected by patient survey at the time of study enrollment. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was captured as a comorbidity if a participant reported history of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, valvular heart disease and or other cardiovascular disease. Metabolic disease was captured as a comorbidity if a patient reported history of diabetes, pre-diabetes, or impaired glucose tolerance. Lung disease was captured with history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma. Other reported comorbidities were categorized as "other.".

As shown in Fig. 1, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive subjects tended to have higher biomarker levels compared to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative subjects. However, no differences reached statistical significance. In total, 46 subjects had elevated CRP (Fig. 1A). Thirty-one of 81 (38.3 %) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive and 15 of 50 (30.0 %) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative subjects (P = 0.35 for difference in proportion) had elevated CRP levels during the 8-week follow-up visit (Table 2). In total, five subjects had elevated ferritin levels (Fig. 1B); all these subjects were male and of the White race, with one being Hispanic ethnicity. Three of

81 (3.7 %) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive and two of 50 (4.0 %) SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR negative subjects had elevated ferritin levels (P = 1.0 difference in proportion; Table 2). One of the subjects with elevated ferritin also had elevated CRP. In total, 18 subjects had elevated IL-6 levels (Fig. 1C). Eleven of 81 (13.8 %) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive and 7 of 50 (14.0 %) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative subjects had high IL6 levels (P = 1.0 for difference in proportion; Table 2). In total, nine subjects had elevated NT-pro-BNP levels (Fig. 1D). Seven of 81 (8.6 %) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive subjects and two of 50 (4.0 %) of SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR negative subjects had elevated NT-pro-BNP levels (P = 0.49 for difference in proportion; Table 2). In total, 17 subjects in total had elevated troponin levels (Fig. 1E). Thirteen of 81 (16 %) SARS-CoV-

2 RT-PCR positive and four of 50 (8 %) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative (P = 0.28 for difference in proportion; Table 2) had elevated cardiac troponin levels.

3.3. Correlation of elevated biomarkers with the presence of comorbidities
Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to look for an asso­ ciation between the presence of >=1 comorbidity (composite of CVD, lung disease, and metabolic disease) and elevated biomarkers. Presence of any comorbidity was used as the dichotomous predictor, and elevated biomarker was used as the dichotomous outcome. Analyses were adjusted for age. ORs are reported for the overall sample as well as in strata defined by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR status. Results are shown in Fig. 2. Higher CRP was positively associated with comorbidities in the overall sample (OR = 2.89, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.27-6.75, P = 0.0121) and among SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive subjects (OR = 4.03, 95 % CI 1.32-13.2, P = 0.0163) but not SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative subjects (P = 0.245). No other biomarkers were statistical significantly associated with presence of  1 comorbidity.
In addition, there were several non-significant associations between comorbidities and biomarker elevations. Two (out of 18) subjects with elevated IL-6 had metabolic disease, both of which were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. Two (out of 18) subjects with elevated IL-6 also had lung disease, one of which was SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. Eight of the nine (88.9 %) subjects with elevated NT-pro-BNP levels were female; seven (out of nine) of the patients with elevated NT-pro-BNP had SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR positive test. Three (out of nine) subjects with elevated

NT-pro-BNP had history of CVD, and one patient also had elevated troponins. Regarding troponins, CVD was the only comorbidity present among subjects with elevated troponins - present in two of the SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR positive and one of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative subjects.
3.4. Correlation of CVD, lung, and metabolic disease with elevated cardiac biomarkers
To tease apart differential associations of biomarkers with specific comorbidities, multivariate logistic regression was conducted for each biomarker against a history of CVD, lung disease, and metabolic disease. Comorbidity was used as the dichotomous outcome, and elevated biomarker level was used as the dichotomous predictor. Analyses were adjusted for age. ORs are reported for the overall sample as well as in strata defined by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR status. Odds of metabolic disease were greater in individuals with elevated CRP. This effect was accen­ tuated in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals (OR = 13.1, 95 % CI 1.86-265, P = 0.025) compared to the overall sample (OR = 5.42, 95 % CI 1.06-40.4, P = 0.0552) and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative subjects (OR = 0.50, 95 % CI 0.034-735, P = 0.99; Fig. 3A). Similarly, odds of history of CVD were greater among individuals with elevated NT-proBNP, with the highest effect occurring in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals (OR = 16.9, 95 % CI 1.56-277, P = 0.026) compared to the overall sample (OR = 3.56, 95 % CI 0.59-18.1, P = 0.14) and COVID-19negative subjects (OR = 0.84, 95 % CI 0.50-692, P = 0.99; Fig. 3B). Troponin, ferritin, and IL-6 did not have any statistically significant associations with comorbidities.

4. Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR positive infection in young, ambulatory adults may be asso­ ciated with biomarker elevations 4-8 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity in individuals with history of comorbidities but not in the general population of young healthy individuals or in individuals without comorbidities. While serum levels of all measured biomarkers trended higher in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive compared to SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR negative subjects, these results did not reach statistical sig­ nificance (Table 1, Fig. 1). Similarly, the proportion of individuals with elevated biomarkers did not differ between SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR posi­ tive versus SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative subjects, although odds of el­ evations in CRP, NT-pro-BNP, and troponin were greater among SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR positive subjects (Table 2). Our results are consistent with a prior study demonstrating that statistically significant biomarker elevations only predicted risk of mortality [8]. Our study population of young, mostly healthy adults with low CoronaHeart Risk Scores [16] likely had a minimal risk of mortality due to a COVID-19 infection, and our study was not powered to examine mortality.
Post-COVID-19 syndrome can occur up to six months after COVID-19 infection and is characterized by cardiac complications such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure, as well as vascular complications such as venous thromboembolism [17]. While less common, children who suffer COVID-19 infection also exhibit post-COVID-19 cardiac dysfunction in up to one-third patients, characterized by left ventricular hypokinesia and dilatation, coronary artery aneurysm, and electrocardiographic abnormalities [18]. Elevated troponin levels are seen in 76% of patients

up to two months after COVID-19 infection despite normal heart func­ tion [19]. Moreover, echocardiographic evidence of reduced global longitudinal strain despite preserved ejection fraction has been reported among COVID-19 patients, indicating the presence of subclinical cardiac damage [20]. Myocardial damage can occur after COVID-19 infection due to several reasons: microthrombus formation, persistent systemic inflammation, cytokine-mediated pathologic cardiac hypertrophy [21], and direct viral infection. A study of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes demonstrated that troponin release is greatest when iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes are infected with COVID-19 in the presence versus absence of IL-6 and IL-1 [22]. The percentage of infected cells remained constant at 35 % regardless of the presence of ILs, indicating that direct infection likely does play a key role in myocardial damage relative to cytokine-mediated damage. Interest­ ingly, however, autopsies performed in ten patients who died of COVID19 infection failed to demonstrate appreciable evidence of lymphocytic myocarditis, but rather showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with microthrombi [23]. It is important to note that these patients had severe (i.e., fatal) COVID-19 infection and may not be representative of the mildly symptomatic and/or asymptomatic patients in our study cohort. Altogether, it seems likely that direct COVID-19 infection of car­ diomyocytes plays a key role in COVID-19-related myocardial damage, but whether there is persistent viral infection within the myocardium remains elusive.
Nonetheless, we did observe statistically significant associations among individuals with comorbidities. CRP was statistically signifi­ cantly associated with the presence of one or more comorbidities (Fig. 2) as well as metabolic disease in SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR positive subjects (Fig. 3A). Indeed, post-COVID-19 CRP elevation have been reportedly to be greater in diabetics compared to non-diabetics [24]. The degree of CRP elevation has also been shown to predict COVID-19 outcomes [25]. However, it is important to note, due to small sample size, the single CRP cutoff of 5.0 mg/L used in this study was not adjusted for the potential confounding effects of sex (higher CRP in females), race (higher CRP in African Americans), and body mass index (higher in obese individuals) on CRP levels [26].
The difference in proportion of SARS-COV-2-positive vs SARS-COV2-negative individuals with elevated ferritin did not reach statistical significance (Table 2). Like CRP, ferritin is an acute phase reactant that reflects the degree of acute and chronic inflammation as well as monocyte/macrophage activation [27]. Studies have shown ferritin to be an independent predictor of COVID-19 severity [28] and a marker of COVID-19 renal involvement [29] and thromboembolism [30]. Our study demonstrates that the odds of elevated ferritin did not differ by COVID-19 status when measured 4-8 weeks after detection of COVID19. This could have been because the individuals in our study had mild COVID-19 infection and ferritin may be associated with severe COVID-19 infection [28]. Alternatively, ferritin, is an acute phase reactant and may have decreased back to normal levels by the time of sera collection 4-8 weeks later.
In our study, the percent of individuals with elevated IL-6 did not differ between COVID-19 cases and controls. While higher IL-6 has been shown to predict risk of mortality from acute COVID-19 infection [8], it is important to note that contrary to our subjects with mild disease, the subjects in former studies reporting this association were very sick (i.e., hospitalized, requiring ICU stay). Furthermore, like ferritin, IL-6 may have been elevated at the time of infection but may have had decreased back to normal by the time of sera collection 4-8 weeks post-infection. Indeed, IL-6 is secreted by macrophages at sites of infection and, like CRP and other acute phase reactants, decreases back to normal levels around one week after infection [31]. Our study used a cutoff of 25 pg/ mL, which has been shown to have prognostic value for mortality and intensive care unit admission in subjects with COVID-19 pneumonia [32]. In the same study, mild COVID-19 pneumonia had mean IL-6 of 7.7 pg/mL, moderate 35.5 pg/mL, and severe 321 pg/mL [32]. Thus, a cutoff of 25 pg/mL in a young, healthy adult population may have

IJC Heart & Vasculature 43 (2022) 101144
excluded some individuals with greater-than-normal IL-6 levels. Among the biomarkers tested in this study, NT-pro-BNP was asso­
ciated with history of CVD in SARS-COV-2-positive subjects (P = 0.026, Fig. 3B). Interestingly, troponin was not associated with CVD in the overall sample nor COVID-positive subjects. We used a cutoff of 0.01 ng/ mL (rather than the clinical cutoff for myocardial ischemia of 0.03 ng/ mL) for troponin based on population-based screening studies [14]. It is important to note that other studies of COVID-19-related cardiac injury may have used the high-sensitivity, rather than standard, troponin assay, to predict myocardial damage [33]. Nonetheless, we did not find troponin elevations in young, healthy adults, 4-8 weeks after asymp­ tomatic or mild COVID-19 infection, even in those with pre-existing CVD. Elevations in troponin and NT-pro-BNP have been associated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccination-related myocarditis [34]. However, the time frame of our study (latter half of 2020) makes it unlikely that study subjects had received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, which were approved by the FDA on August 31, 2021 [35] and January 31, 2022 [36], respectively.
Our study has several limitations. First, sera samples were collected 4-8 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. While we still found evidence of some biomarker elevations, these and other biomarkers could have been elevated had the sera been collected closer to the time of COVID-19 infection. Our ability to detect differences in proportion of elevated biomarkers by COVID-19 status was also likely hindered by the small sample sizes in our study, particularly the small proportion of in­ dividuals with elevated biomarkers, which is to be expected among young, healthy adults. Nevertheless, the biomarker elevations we did find to be elevated are likely true positives considering the relatively long time between COVID-19 testing and biomarker quantification. Second, our study was cross-sectional. A longitudinal study comparing biomarkers before and after COVID-19 infection would have helped account for the large inter-individual variation in circulating biomarker levels. Third, levels of cardiac troponin and CRP were not assessed using high sensitivity assays. Use of high sensitivity troponin portends greater prognostic utility compared to the conventional cardiac troponin assay [37,38]. Data is mixed for high sensitivity compared to standard CRP [39,40]. Nevertheless, use of standard assays may have precluded detection of more subtle increases in biomarkers below the limit of detection of conventional assays that may be more likely in a population of young, healthy adults. Finally, different cut-offs in biomarker levels, specific for sex, race, age could have resulted in different findings. Given the small sample size, we used a single cut-off for the biomarkers, which is another limitation of our study.
5. Conclusions
Our study provides evidence that proinflammatory and cardiac biomarkers are not elevated in young, ambulatory adults 4-8 weeks following mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with higher biomarker elevations among in­ dividuals with pre-existing comorbidities. Future longitudinal studies are needed to explore the utility of biomarkers in young adults after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems, which are representative genome editing technologies, are classified into class 1 and class 2 in terms of evolutionary biology and are further classified into several subtypes. Class 2 CRISPR systems, including type II Cas9 and type V Cas12a, are the most commonly used for genome editing in eukaryotic cells, while type I CRISPR systems within Class 1 are also becoming available. Type I CRISPR recognizes longer target sequences than CRISPR-Cas9 and can induce large deletion mutations of several kilobases. These features demonstrate its potential as a novel and unique genome editing tool that can induce genetic disruption safely and reliably. Thus, it is expected to be utilized for gene therapy and industrial applications. Recently, the DNA cleavage mechanism of type I CRISPR has also revealed details from protein-complex analyses with X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and highspeed atomic force microscopy. The single-strand DNA trans-cleavage activity of type I CRISPR, called collateral activity, has broadened the potential application for CRISPR diagnostics, especially in the development of pointof-care testing methods for COVID-19. In this review, we present an overview of the type I CRISPR system, its application to genome editing, and genetic diagnosis using CRISPR-Cas3.

Introduction
Development of CRISPR-Cas based genome editing
The CRISPR-Cas system is an adaptive immune system mechanism in bacteria and archaea. This immune response functions mainly through adaptation, processing, and interference processes (Fig. 1). In the adaptation process, the Cas protein complex binds to its target DNA sequence next to the short motif, called the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), in a foreign DNA molecule derived from a virus or phage that has infected the bacterium. The complex then cuts off a portion of the target DNA, called the protospacer. The Cas-adaptation complex inserts the protospacer DNA into the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) array to become a spacer. In the processing and interference processes, CRISPR arrays are usually transcribed as a single transcript, called the pre-CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA). This is then processed into mature CRISPR RNA (crRNA) molecules, which each contain a spacer sequence and part of a flanking repeat. This crRNA typically remains bound to the processing complex (or single protein) and works as a guide to recognize the protospacer (or similar sequence) in the invading genome of the virus or plasmid. The nuclease protein in the complex (or single protein) then cleaves and degrades the foreign DNA molecules [ 1 , 2 ].

Genome editing technology harnessing the interference process of the CRISPR-Cas system is currently the most popular innovative tool for genomic manipulations in eukaryotic cells. CRISPR-Cas9, the most representative tool, works by specifically recognizing and binding to target DNA sequences and introducing double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the genome. These DSBs are mainly repaired by the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed repair (HDR) pathways. HDR is a precise repair mechanism that uses homologous donor DNA to fix DNA damage, while NHEJ repairs cleavage sites without the use of homologous sequences and is likely to occur throughout a cell cycle. While the NHEJ pathway provides accurate re-joining, repeated cleavage by Cas9 induces small insertions or deletions (indels) at the cleavage site [3,4]. CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing technology is being applied in various life science and medical fields. Simultaneously, novel genome editing tools with improved safety and efficiency, as well as unique functions, are also being developed [5-7].
Classification of the CRISPR-Cas system
The CRISPR-Cas systems are classified in evolutionary taxonomy as class 1 and class 2, each subdivided into three types (type I, III, IV and type II, V, VI, respectively) [8] (Fig. 1). Class 1 systems use multiple different Cas proteins, while class 2 effectors contain only a single pro-

Fig. 1. Adaptive immune system by the CRISPR-Cas system. This immune response functions mainly through adaptation, processing, and interference processes. Short fragments of invading nucleic acids are captured by adaptive Cas proteins and inserted in the CRISPR array as new spacers. The expressed precursor crRNA from this region is processed into mature crRNAs by the Cas effector protein: Cas6 for types I and III, Cas5d for type I-C, and Csf5 for type IV in class 1. cOA: cyclic oligoadenylate. The CRISPR-Cas effector complexes are then formed. In class 2 systems, type II Cas9 binds and stabilizes the tracrRNA:crRNA duplex and further recruits RNase III for crRNA processing. Type V and type VI effector proteins process nuclease activity for crRNA maturation by themselves. These complexes recognize target sequences that have complementarity with crRNAs and cleave the invading nucleic acids by their respective mechanisms. Several types show collateral cleavage activity to ssDNA or RNA.

tein. In the last decade, single subunit effectors from class 2 CRISPR systems have been widely used for genomic engineering in eukaryotic cells. For example, the CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a systems used for DNA editing are classified as type II and type V, respectively [9-11], while CRISPR-Cas13 used for RNA editing is type VI [12]. New genome editing technologies, such as the miniature CRISPR-Cas12f (Cas14) and CRISPR-Cas12J [13,14], and the CRISPR-associated transposase CAST, have also been successively identified from class 2 type V CRISPR [15]. The single factor needed to function as a genome editing tool is easy to handle, and its small size facilitates delivery to the target cells via DNA vectors, mRNAs, or protein-RNA complexes, making them highly convenient for genomic manipulation.
The class 1 system represents approximately 90% of CRISPR-Cas loci in bacteria, and almost 100% in archaea [16]. Among the class 1 CRISPR, the type I system is the most widespread and functions as a crRNA-bound multiprotein complex, termed CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense (Cascade), with a Cas3 endonuclease that is recruited upon target binding by Cascade and activated to cleave foreign DNAs [1,17].
Type III CRISPR systems are known to cleave both RNA and DNA by effector Csm or Cmr complexes [18]. The recognition of a target mRNA tethers the complex to the transcription locus, resulting in degradation of the RNAs. Several subtypes, such as Type III-A, B, and C, display non-specific single strand DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity, which can induce DNA degradation around the binding sites. At the same time, cyclic oligoadenylates (cOA) are synthesized as a second messenger and acti-

vate CRISPR-Cas associated proteins, like the Csm6/Csx1 RNase family. This results in non-specific RNA cleavage [19,20]. Type IV CRISPR lacks both the adaptive module and nucleases required for interference, and its detailed function is not well understood [21].
These class 1 CRISPR systems, which require the regulation of multiple factors, are difficult to utilize in eukaryotic cells and have not been applied to genome editing tools. However, type I systems are now also emerging as tools for genome and transcriptome manipulation in microbiota [22,23] and eukaryotic cells [24-27]. Furthermore, type I-A and I-E CRISPR exhibits non-specific single strand DNA (ssDNA) cleavage after target recognition in double strand DNA (dsDNA), as well as Cas12a [28,29]. The trans-cleavage activity, called collateral activity, is used in CRISPR-based diagnostics (CRISPR-Dx) as a platform for rapid and sensitive nucleic acid detection, such as in COVID-19 test kits [29-31]. In this review, we focus on the biological characterization of the type I CRISPR system and its application as a genome editing technology for eukaryotic cells and CRISPR-Dx.
Biological characteristics of type I CRISPR systems
Type I systems in the interference process generally consist of effector factors, including the nuclease Cas3 and the multiprotein complexes that comprise the cascade. Depending on the number of cascade proteins and the repeat sequences, seven different subtypes have been defined: I-A, I-B, I-C, I-U, I-D, I-E, and I-F [1,8]. Cascade proteins of the type I

system typically include Cas5, Cas6, Cas7, and Cas8 (Cse1), with some subtypes also presenting Cas4 and/or Cas11 (Cse2) [1,32].
Target recognition by the cascade complex
The type I CRISPR system degrades the target region of dsDNA through two major steps: 1) recognition of target DNA by searching with the cascade complex and 2) cleavage of the DNA by Cas3 nuclease recruitment to the cascade complex [33-41] (Fig. 2).
In the first step, the cascade complex scans the PAM and initiates DNA unwinding [42]. The crRNA then hybridizes with the target DNA strand (TS), which leads to detachment of the non-target strand (NTS) and the formation of a three-stranded nucleic acid structure called an R-loop [34,35,41].
In the cascade complex, Cas6 recognizes the hairpin structure of precrRNA and processes it into the mature crRNA via its RNase activity. Cas5 binds the 5 handle, then multiple Cas7 proteins form the backbone along the crRNA. Cas11 stabilizes the crRNA and target strand DNA loop (R-loop) structure. Cas8 recognizes PAM sequences and recruits Cas3 to a target DNA sequence [43].
PAM sequences are important for the cascade complex to search for target sequences, but even the same CRISPR subtype shows a preference for various PAM sequences in different microorganisms [1,44]. The strength of PAM sequence preference also differs and is promiscuous, making it difficult to experimentally demonstrate a unified sequence. As has been well demonstrated in E. coli-derived I-E, AAG, TAG, GAG, AGG, and ATG are functional PAM sequences, while AAC is functional albeit slightly reduced [44]. The diversity of functional PAM sequences among different Type I CRISPR systems expands the potential for freely designing targets for genome editing with this system, even in regions with high GC or AT content. This will provide the opportunity for many researchers to select the appropriate genome editing tools with Type I CRISPR.
DNA degradation by the cascade-Cas3 complex
Complete formation of the R-loop with the cascade complex induces a conformational change that enables recruitment of Cas3 [45- 47]. Cas3, a protein with a Superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase domain and a histidine-aspartate (HD) nuclease domain, degrades the target DNA in an ATP-dependent manner according to the following steps: nicking the NTS in the R-loop, loading the ssDNA into the helicase domain, and unwinding the DNA while degrading the ssDNA [39,41,47].
Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer experiments have demonstrated that Cas3 remains with cascade to cleave ssDNA using a reeling mechanism [36]. In vitro experiments using high-speed atomic force microscopy also demonstrated that Cas3 remains tightly associated with cascade, which repeatedly reels and releases the target DNA, then degrades the target [48]. In addition, Cas3 with cascade from E. coli exhibits collateral non-specific ssDNA cleavage activity [29,48]. The current interference mechanism from these reports suggests that stable cascade binding with locked R-loop construction provides cis cleavage of the NTS with helicase-dependent separation by reeling activity and trans cleavage of the TS by collateral activity. This results in progressive degradation of target dsDNA substrates.
Cas3 nuclease can bind to the conformationally changed Cascade complex by precise and complete recognition of the target sequence, which then activates its nuclease function. With multiple steps controlling the nuclease activity, the risk of Cas3 activation with incomplete recognition that results in unnecessary DNA cleavage can be significantly reduced. This high-fidelity interference process ensures the destruction of perfectly matching targets to destroy foreign invaders with safety (Fig. 2). A recent report showed that type I-A cascade and Cas3 can form an integrated complex, and that the Cas3 nuclease is allosterically activated by cascade upon

full R-loop formation [28]. Collateral cleavage activity has been observed in type I-A, as well as in type I-E, suggesting that a common DNA degradation mechanism occurs in type I CRISPR systems [29] .
Genome editing with the type I CRISPR system
Among the subtypes of class 1 type I CRISPR, I-A, I-C, I-D, and IE have reportedly been used for genome editing in mammalian cells (Table 1). Utilizing the target-binding ability of the cascade complex in the absence of Cas3, cascade-FokI fusion system-mediated generation of small inserted or deleted (indel) mutations [49] and cascade-mediated transcriptional regulation in humans [26] were reported as genetic manipulations in eukaryotes in 2019. In the same year, using the type I-E CRISPR-Cas3 system including a Cas3 nuclease was shown for the first time to result in mainly long-range chromosomal deletions upstream of the 5 PAM in target DNA [24,25]. Here, we summarize the unique characteristics of type I CRISPR-mediated genome editing in human cells.
Type I-E CRISPR
Our group demonstrated genomic deletions in human cells by plasmid-based expression of type I-E CRISPR-Cas3 from E. coli (Eco) and precursor crRNAs, which were intracellularly assembled into a functional complex [25]. The mutated start positions by Eco CRISPR-Cas3 were distributed broadly around 0-400 bp upstream of the PAM locus and the deletion patterns were distributed in a range of 0.5-80 kb from the PAM. Type I-E CRISPR could induce mutations that deleted an average of 5 kb upstream of the 5 PAM sequence, while mutations smaller than 100 bp, as frequently observed in Cas9-mediated deletions, were not induced. Amplicon-seq analysis of more than 10 genes revealed the average efficiency of mutagenesis was approximately 20%. Cas3mediated exon skipping in the DMD gene to repair Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) protein expression was also successful in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from DMD patients, indicating the potential of the type I-E CRISPR system for clinical applications.
Dolan et al. also reported genomic deletions in human embryonic stem (ES) cells by direct introduction of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), consisting of crRNA, Cas3, and cascade derived from Thermobifida fusca (Tfu) [24]. The mutated start positions by Tfu CRISPR-Cas3 were distributed mainly around 0-400 bp upstream of the PAM locus and the deletion patterns were distributed in a range of 0.5-100 kb from the PAM, which are very similar to those by Eco CRISPR-Cas3. These unidirectional and long-range deletions generated by type I-E CRISPR contrast with the smaller indels generated by Cas9 or Cas12-based genome editing.
Type I-D CRISPR
Recently, type I-D, I-C, and I-A systems in Type I CRISPR can also reportedly induce large deletions in eukaryotic cells [27,28,50]. Genetic deletions were made in human HEK293T cells by plasmid-based expression of type I-D CRISPR from Microcystis aeruginosa and precursor crRNAs [50,51]. The system induced long-range deletions ranging from 2.5 kb to 19 kb at the target site. Short indels of a few nucleotides, like those generated by Cas9, were also detected. In addition, the edges of large deletions by the type I-D system are mainly introduced equally on both sides of the target locus, indicating bidirectionality rather than unidirectionality as observed in I-E CRISPR [50,52].
The Cas3 nuclease protein in the type I-A and I-D systems has separate helicase and nuclease domains, called Cas3' and Cas3", respectively [8]. In particular, the Cas3'' domain sequence in I-D CRISPR is encoded as a part of a type III Cas10-like large effector complex, which is named Cas10d [53].The Cas3' protein of the type I-D system, called Cas3d, lacks the HD-nuclease domain responsible for DNA cleavage activity, while Cas10d with an HD-like nuclease domain shows DNA cleavage activity

Fig. 2. Overview of the molecular mechanism in type I-E CRISPR-mediated genome editing. Top panel: Effector factors required to function in genome editing. The cascade complex in type I-E consists of one Cas5, one Cas6, one Cas8, two Cas11, and six Cas7 protein molecules. Middle panel: Cas8 in the cascade complex first scans the PAM sequence. The crRNA hybridizes with the target DNA strand, leading to the formation of a three-stranded nucleic acid structure called the R-loop. After the conformation of cascade is changed, Cas3 binds to the cascade complex. Bottom panel: The recruited Cas3 induces a nick in the non-target DNA strand (NTS) at the R-loop through its nuclease domain (red). Then, the helicase domain (red) in Cas3 unwinds and reels the NTS in an ATP-dependent manner upstream of the PAM site. The collateral activity of Cas3 subsequently cleaves the target strand (TS), resulting in double strand breaks (DSB) upstream of the target site. Combined with repetitive cleavages of the NTS, this can degrade the target double strand DNA substrate as an interference mode (blue).

in eukaryotic cells. Cas10d also functions in PAM recognition, as well as Cas8 in other type I CRISPR systems. The amino acid sequence of Cas10d has higher homology to the type III Cas10 protein than to other type I Cas8 proteins [54]. The detailed mechanism controlling this remains unclear, and these differences in functional units in the DNA cleavage process may affect to the direction of mutations of I-A and I-D CRISPR systems [28].
This has also been successfully applied to the tomato genome, indicating that type I CRISPR can be used not only in humans, but also in other eukaryotic organisms such as plants [51]. As described below, the addition of Cas11, hidden within the Cas10 coding sequence in I-D, or the Cas8 coding sequence in I-B and I-C, recently enabled genome editing in human cells with each type [27]. For example, I-D from cyanobacteria can be used to knock out the transduced GFP gene in human cells with Cas11. Whether Cas11 is also enhanced for the reaction in Microcystis aeruginosa-derived I-D and if it can increase editing efficiency need further investigation.
Type I-C CRISPR
The minimal I-C CRISPR system (cascade-Cas3) derived from Neisseria lactamica (Nla) can induce large deletions of target regions in the human genome by using RNP, plasmid, and mRNA delivery methods [27]. RNP delivery of its processive Cas3 and cascade complex can achieve high editing efficiencies of up to 95% in HAP1 cells and 50% in human ES cells. Most of the large deletions induced by I-C CRISPR are unidirectional, pointing to the PAM-proximal direction.
Importantly, although I-C was previously described as a miniature type I CRISPR system that works with only four components, Cas3, Cas5, Cas7, and Cas8 in bacteria [55], the introduction of hidden Cas11 encoded within the Cas8 sequence enabled this system to function as a genome editing tool for eukaryotes [27]. Cas11 is also hidden in I-B and I-D CRISPR, and both systems derived from cyanobacteria Synechocystis could be used to knock out GFP in human cells in a Cas11-dependent manner [27]. The addition of Cas11 to the previously taxonomically hidden factors is expected to lead to new type I CRISPR systems that can be applied to genome editing in eukaryotic cells.
Type I-A CRISPR
Genome editing by type I-A CRISPR from Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu) was recently achieved in human HAP1 and HEK293 cells by electroporation of RNPs that included the Cas11 protein [28]. The Pfu cascadeCas3 system is more efficient for genome editing when incubated at 42 °C, likely because of the origin from hyperthermophilic archaea. Deleted mutations of several hundred bp to 2 kb have been detected, but longer deletions by deep sequencing have not been investigated.

Type I-A CRISPR introduces bidirectional DNA deletions in human cells with high efficiency like type I-D [28,50]. The molecular mechanism controlling the different directions of deletions in each subtype is not well understood and will be studied more in the future. The PAM sequence of the type I-A system is 5 CCN, which has the advantage for design within GC-rich regions, unlike other type I systems [56,57]. This is expected to play an important role in the expansion of type I CRISPR for genome editing.
Off-target effects
To establish CRISPR as a novel genome editing tool for medical applications, it is important that the method is safe and does not affect similar sequences within the genome, which are called off-target candidate regions. For example, type I-E CRISPR has a longer spacer sequence of 32 nucleotides compared with the 20 nucleotides of Cas9 or the 24 nucleotides of Cas12, which may increase the specificity for target recognition [40,58,59] (Table 1). It should be noted that several nucleotides cannot be recognized within the spacer sequence because of the structure of the protein complex. Type I-E CRISPR cannot recognize every sixth position from the 5 end of the PAM sequence. Therefore, 27 bases in the crRNA are bound to the target strand and considered as a recognition length [40,47,58,59].
Off-target candidates of the Cas9 system in the human genome from two to three mismatches are generally detected by in silico analysis. Target sequences with as few mismatches as possible should be selected [60,61]. In type I CRISPR systems, which have longer target lengths than Cas9, off-target candidates with two or three mismatches are less frequently detected by in silico analysis. For example, in silico analysis to 27 bases within the target sequence of I-E CRISPR can generally detect sequences with five or more mismatches as off-target candidate regions in the human genome [25]. These candidates have been investigated with deep sequencing methods, such as whole genome sequencing and target capture sequencing, and no mutations have been detected. Analyses of genome editing efficiency with mismatches in the target sequences of the I-E and I-D systems demonstrated that DNA cleavage was detected with one or two mismatches, while there was almost no cleavage with three mismatches [25,50]. The proximal region to the PAM sequence, called the seed sequence, should be also considered for the recognition of the target sequence in both class 1 and class 2 CRISPR [25,50,58,59,62]. DNA cleavage is unlikely to occur when there are mismatches up to the 11th nucleotide from the PAM [1]. Off-target effects in human cells have not yet been comprehensively analyzed, and design tools have not yet been reported. We plan to release a design tool for selecting candidate target regions with few off-target sites in type I-E CRISPR, and the development of such a tool will increase the number of type I CRISPR users.

Applications with type I CRISPR systems
The characteristics of type 1 CRISPR indicate its potential application as a new genome editing technology for safe and reliable gene disruption. It has the potential to advance the therapeutic applications of gene therapy and industrial approaches, such as agriculture and fisheries. CRISPR-Cas9 with two gRNAs flanking the region has been shown to also induce large genomic deletions, but Cas9 with two sgRNAs may increase the possibility of undesired off-target mutations, as well as unintended reverse mutations between cleavage sites [25]. Therefore, type I CRISPR is expected to be particularly useful for gene disruption because it can efficiently induce genomic deletions with a single crRNA. However, compared with the many medical and industrial applications of class 2 CRISPR [63-65], type 1 CRISPR is still in the development stage because of numerous issues needing to be resolved, such as safety verification and in vivo delivery difficulties.
Several subtypes have collateral cleavage activity that can result in the cleavage of nearby non-specific sequences after their target. These include type V Cas12a [66] and type VI Cas13 [67,68]. The application of this collateral cleavage to nucleic acid detection is called CRISPRDx, and the COVID-19 global pandemic has led to an explosive increase in research on its application as point-of-care testing (POCT) for virus detection. This application has high potential for not only the rapid detection of viruses and pathogens, but also the identification of various inherited diseases and mutation patterns in cancer cells for diagnoses [ 69 , 70 ].
In CRISPR-Dx, the presence of a target sequence, such as viral nucleic acid, triggers the collateral activity of the CRISPR complex and cleaves a non-specific DNA/RNA probe in trans. The detection probe with fluorescent marker is quenched in the intact state and emits fluorescence when cleaved by the activated CRISPR complex [69,70]. The detection method using Cas12a was established as the DETECTR (DNA endonuclease targeted CRISPR trans reporter), and CRISPR-Cas13a targeting RNA was also established as the SHERLOCK (Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) method [66-68]. Because type I-E CRISPR also has collateral cleavage activity, the CRISPR-Cas3-based nucleic acid detection method was established as the CONAN (Cas3 Operated Nucleic Acid detectioN) method [29]. These excellent diagnostic methods are already available for COVID-19 detection, having both the advantages of sensitivity and accuracy of PCR testing and the speed, convenience, and low cost of antigen testing [30,71-74]. Recently, it was reported that type I-A has also collateral cleavage activity at 58 °C, indicating the possibility of its use for CRISPR-Dx [28]. The development of type I CRISPR for diagnostic tools will continue to be expanded in the future.
Conclusion
About 10 years have passed since CRISPR-Cas9 was first reported, and clinical trials in gene therapy for various diseases are already in progress [65,75,76]. The future for its medical applications is promising. Type I CRISPR can efficiently edit large genomic regions without requiring multiple crRNAs as CRISPR-Cas9 does. It is expected to be useful for gene therapy by exon skipping, complete removal of viral sequences or transposons, and efficient analysis of long non-coding regions. However, the following issues have been raised: lower genome editing efficiency compared with CRISPR-Cas9, difficulty in vivo delivery because of the large number of effector factors required, and controlling deletion sizes. By addressing these issues, type I CRISPR will become more useful as a genome editing tool in eukaryotes.
Type I CRISPR is also expected to be used for CRISPR-Dx, which has recently been utilized for COVID-19 diagnosis. In addition to type I CRISPR, type III CRISPR is also class 1 and is available for CRISPRDx [77-79]. Among the seven technologies to watch in 2022 by Nature, CRISPR-related technologies are three of them: "Precise genome manipulation," "Targeted genetic therapies," and "CRISPR-based diagnostics" [80]. Genome editing technology is used in various life science fields

and basic research worldwide, and type I and class 2 CRISPR systems are also becoming indispensable technologies.

ABSTRACT
We report wastewater surveillance of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 based upon 24-h composite influent samples taken weekly from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) on Vancouver Island, BC, Canada between January 3, 2021 and July 10, 2021. Samples were analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain re­ action targeting the N1 and N2 gene fragments of SARS-CoV-2 and a region of the replication associate protein of the pepper mottle mosaic virus (PMMoV) serving as endemic control. Only a small proportion of samples had quantifiable levels of N1 or N2. Overall case rates are weakly correlated with the concentration (gene copies/L) and with the flux of viral material influent to the WWTP (gene copies/day); the latter accounts for influent flow variations. Poisson multimodal rank correlation accounts for differences between the four WWTP and shows a significant correlation with a significant positive intercept. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis confirms a cut-off of cases based on amplified/not-amplified experimental data. At the optimal cut point of 19 (N1) or 17 (N2) cases/week/100,000 the sensitivity and specificity is about 75% for N1 and 67% for N2.

1. Introduction
The Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus has left millions of people infected and left billions of others affected. Hosts can spread SARS-CoV-2 as early as 24-h after infection during a 2-week incubation period during which symptoms may or may not present (Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: implications for infection prevention precautions 2022). The longevity and frequency of asymptomatic transmission can delay clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2 (Xagoraraki and O'Brien, 2020) and can reflect local testing resources rather than an accurate estimation of true prevalence (Majowicz et al., 2005). Accordingly, widespread commu­ nity transmission can occur prior to the adoption of any appropriate precautionary action (Wu et al., 2020). These limitations have caused researchers to take alternative approaches for identifying SARS-CoV-2 in populations through active surveillance that can provide an earlier warning of an outbreak and accordingly, significantly lowering the epidemic curve (Ibrahim, 2020). Previously, wastewater testing has been central to public health responses in other infectious disease epi­ demics, including the near-eradication of poliovirus (Asghar et al., 2014) as well as detecting outbreaks of enteroviral and hepatitis in­ fections (Pellegrinelli et al., 2016).
Wastewater monitoring provides an opportunity for active surveil­ lance. Hosts infected with SARS-CoV-2 shed the virus in their fecal matter, creating the opportunity to gather data from the excreted fecal matter in wastewater for a set population (Larsen and Wigginton, 2020; Philo et al., 2022). In contrast to passive surveillance based on clinical testing, active testing of viral molecular markers in wastewater presents benefits, including (i) detecting SARS-CoV-2 from both symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers; and (ii) sampling a large portion of the population to provide better insight as to the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in such populations (Mallapaty, 2020).
The most common method to detect SARS-CoV-2 is qPCR, addi­ tionally over the COVID-19 pandemic other methods have been recently used such as droplet qPCR and (PCR)-based or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (Ramírez-Chavarría et al., 2022; Alhama et al., 2022).
The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has been correlated to clinical testing data in over 60 countries (Medema et al., 2020; Ahmed et al., 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020; COVIDPoops19 Dashboard, 2022), demonstrating the relationships between both datasets, as well as the capacity and feasibility of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to provide robust data regardless of clinical testing uptake. At smaller scales, several examples exist where testing of wastewater in concrete settings has allowed proactive isolation and targeted clinical testing for impacted populations (Betancourt et al., 2021; Ahmed et al., 2021)
WBE offers potentially unbiased surveillance in areas where testing is not as readily available. Community testing applied routinely might provide a warning of virus present in the community; several authors have noted that it cannot replace standard testing (Wu et al., 2020; Michael-Kordatou et al., 2020). Many WBE studies focus on a correlation of viral concentration with case rates in the population. Such correla­ tions are significant when relatively high case rates occur in larger population centers. A recent report of WBE in communities of different sizes across Scotland provides clear correlations of viral concentration with clinical case rates, but there was substantial variability in the sig­ nificance of the correlation in smaller population centers (Fitzgerald et al., 2021).
This study explores the utility of WBE for surveillance on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada between January 3, 2021, and July 10, 2021. This is a relatively low population density region that experienced a clear wave of infections in the study period. The peak infection case rate was relatively low compared with other studies (< 60 cases/week/ 100,000) although there were cases of the disease continually throughout the study period. Wastewater samples were collected as part

of routine water quality testing from wastewater treatment plants of four municipal sewersheds. While a wealth of literature now exists regarding sample preparation and analysis strategies, surveillance methods used to inactivate, filter, concentrate and extract viral RNA and the correlating analysis by qPCR were developed based on literature and best practices available in the absence of any international consensus at the beginning of this study (O'Reilly et al., 2020). The accumulated dataset supports a variety of statistical analyses to explore correlations of case rates with viral concentrations and viral influent flux based on quantified samples. The focus is on the sensitivity and specificity of qPCR methodology for WBE as it applied in the region during the period of study.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Sampling at WWTP and Transportation
Four different sample sites were located on Vancouver Island, BC, Canada: (i) McLoughlin Point Wastewater Treatment Plant (MCL) in Esquimalt serving the core municipalities of Victoria, Esquimalt, Saa­ nich, Oak Bay, View Royal, Langford and Colwood, and the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations; (ii) Saanich Peninsula Treatment Plant (SP) at Bazan Bay, which serves North and Central Saanich, the town of Sidney, and the Tseycum, Tsartlip, and Pauquachin First Nations; (iii) French Creek Pollution Control Centre (FC) that serves Qualicum Beach, Parksville and the service areas of French Creek, Pacific Shores, Surfside and Barclay Crescent; and (iv) Greater Nanaimo Pollution Control Centre (GN), which serves the City of Nanaimo, Snuneymuxw First Nation, and the District of Lantzville. Influent composite samples (500 mL) were collected in sterile Nalgene bottles using ISCO 5800 auto­ mated samplers (Teledyne ISCO, Lincoln, NE, USA) at GN, FC, and SP. Time-based composite samples were collected over 24 h (every 15 min at GN and FC, every 30 min at SP). At MCL, 24-h flow-proportional composite influent samples (500 mL) were collected in sterile Nalgene bottles using an Endress+Hauser CSF48 (Endress+Hauser AG, Switzerland) automated sampler. Sampling occurred once per week between January 2021 and July 2021 at all four sites. Once the samples were collected, they were transported on ice and stored at 4 C and processed within 48 h of receipt.
2.2. Virus concentration and RNA extraction
The samples were inactivated by a 30-min cycle under two 15W germicidal UV-C fluorescent light bulbs followed by 90 min in a bead bath using Lab ArmorTM Beads (Cat. No. A1254301, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) at 60 C. The virus was concentrated using two different methods: poly-ethylene glycol precipitation (PEG) (Devel­ oping a Wastewater Surveillance Sampling Strategy, 2022) and skim milk flocculation (SMF) (Philo et al., 2022).
Method 1- PEG Precipitation: 40 mL of inactivated sample was decanted once solids were settled and added to a 50 mL centrifuge tube containing 4 g of polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000) (Cat. No. P2139, EMD Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and 0.9 g of Sodium Chloride (NaCl). This process was repeated twice per sample site to a total of 80 mL. The samples were vigorously shaken by hand then placed on ice and shaken at 100 rpm for 1 h. The samples were left at 4 C overnight, followed by two hours of centrifugation at 12,000 x g at 4 C. The su­ pernatant other than approximately 1 mL was poured out and the pellets were resuspended in the remaining liquid using a pipette, vortexed then transferred to a 1.5 mL microfuge tube. The samples were then centri­ fuged for 5 min at 12,000 x g. The supernatant was completely removed. The pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 C until ready to be further processed. The extra wastewater samples that were not concentrated were decanted into 50 mL centrifuged tubes, flash frozen and placed at - 80 C.
Method 2- Skim Milk Flocculation: 40 mL of 5% skim milk (w/v) solution was made using Skim Milk Powder (Cat. No. OXLP0031B,

2

Environmental Advances 9 (2022) 100310

Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and dissolved completely in distilled water. Once dissolved, the milk solution was autoclaved for 15 min. 2.5 mL of autoclaved skim milk solution was added to 250 mL wastewater sample (10% of the skim milk solution to sample volume).
The pH of the samples was adjusted with 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) to a pH of 3-4. The samples were shaken for 2 h at 200 rpm at room temperature, then poured into 50 mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 30 min at 4 C at 3000 x g. The supernatant was discarded from all samples and the pellets from the tubes were pooled and resuspended in 3 mL PBS and transferred to a 15 mL conical tube and vortexed and stored at - 80 C until needed.
The All Prep PowerViral DNA/RNA Kit (Cat. No. 28000-50, Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) was used for the RNA extractions. For method 1, the pellets were suspended in 300 µL of PM1/2-Mercaptoethanol so­ lution. Two pellets from each site were then combined. For method 2, a 200 µL sample was mixed with 600 µL PM1/2-Mercaptoethanol solu­ tion. Instructions were followed per the manufacturer's instructions with some minor modifications with the addition of 600 µL of anhydrous ethanol to help precipitate the RNA out of the solution. The final pellet was eluted in 30 µL RNAse/DNAse-free water and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before the final centrifugation step at 13,000 x g for 1 min. The RNA pellet was placed at - 80 C until ready for further processing.
2.3. qPCR
One-step RT-qPCR was performed using Luna® Probe One-Step RTqPCR 4X Mix with UDG (Cat. No. M3019E, New England Biolabs, Ips­ wich, MA, USA) to analyse N1 and N2 gene fragments of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV RUO Kit) (Cat. No. 10006713, IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) and PMMoV (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA). All RT-qPCR amplifications were performed in 10 L reactions. All RT-qPCR amplifications were per­ formed in 10 L reactions. The following mastermixes were made: (i) N1, containing forward and reverse primers concentrations of 400 nM each and the probe at a concentration of 125 nM; (ii) N2, containing forward and reverse primers at concentrations of 400 nM each and the probe at a concentration of 125 nM; and (iii) PMMoV, containing for­ ward and reverse primers at concentrations of 500 nM each and the probe containing affinity plus beads at a concentration of 125 nM. 1 µL of RNA sample was added per reaction. Sequences of the primers and probes are shown in Table S1. For method two (skim milk), the samples were run both undiluted and with a 1:4 dilution, diluted in RNAse/ DNAse free water. For quantification, a relative standard curve was made on each plate using SARS-CoV-2 Standard (Cat. No. COV019, Exact Diagnostics, Fort Worth, TX, USA) or Armored RNA (aRNA) Quant SARS-CoV-2 (Cat. No. 52030, Cedarlane, Burlington, ON, Canada) with a 5 series dilution ranging from 6.25 copies/µL to 100 copies/mL for N1 and N2 and 5 series dilution of a DNA gBlock Gene Fragment (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) for the PMMoV standard starting at 1.524×10E6 copies/µL to 152.4 copies/µL. Each standard curve included a no tem­ plate control using RNAse/DNAse free water. All samples and standards were run in triplicate. The RNA was released from the aRNA before adding the sample to the plate by heat lysis at 75 C for 5 min. Using the Applied biosystems StepOnePlus qPCR machine (Thermo Fisher, Wal­ tham, MA, USA), the cycling conditions were 25 C for 30 s to prevent carryover, 55 C for 10 min to initiate reverse transcription, 95 C for 1 min for initial denaturation, and 45 cycles at 95 C for 10 s and 55 C for 1 min for the denaturation and extension steps, respectively. Only samples that had no detection for the NTC and were positive for the PMMoV were accepted.
2.4. qPCR data handling
The instrument datafile for export consisted of header information and 96 data rows that included a sample identifier and its measured CT value, mean and standard deviation of identified triplicate wells, and

flags reporting checks done on the baseline, the amplification, and the threshold; any failed flags set the measured CT value for the well as "undetermined". No calibration data or statistical information was available for export. The export file was processed using python scripting to isolate the calibration information for each target, identify and remove any "undetermined" wells, generate a calibration curve by linear regression of CT as f(log (copies/well)), and determine regression statistics. The results matched the limited calibration information for the datafile viewed by the instrument internal software; the reported mean and standard deviation were correctly calculated within the instrument. The instrument datafile was processed to isolate the sample data rows (identifier, measured CT including any "undetermined" values of CT, CT mean and standard deviation, flags indicating experiment failure).
The calibration limit of detection (LOD) in qPCR has been exten­ sively discussed and statistically robust methods have been recom­ mended (Ellison et al., 2006; Forootan et al., 2017). Unfortunately, our survey is based on triplicate wells from a single sample which do not support in-depth statistical methods. We follow earlier suggestions of (Burns and Valdivia (2007) and Ellison et al. (2006) that tie to a con­ ventional chemical analysis (Shrivastava and Gupta, 2011) and are related to logistic models as recommended in Forootan et al. (2017). The LOD is determined from the ratio of the standard error (SE) and the absolute value of the slope (m) of the regression (calibration LOD = 3 SE/|m|). Following convention, the calibration limit of quantification (LOQ) = 10 SE/|m|. The semi-log calibration values are converted to copies/well via the antilog.
The associated calibration slope and intercept, regression informa­ tion (r-squared, standard error), calibration limit of detection and limit of quantification (LOD, LOQ) was appended to each row. Additional flags were appended to identify sample non-detects (ND) and detectednot-quantified (DNQ) based on the calibration LOD/LOQ. Processed sample rows were appended to a primary datafile containing all qPCR results.
The sample identifier allowed additional fields to be appended to each row to separately identify the sample location, sample date, and the method used for RNA isolation. The method further identified the sample dilution factor and its uncertainty which were appended to each sample row. This in turn allowed the calculation of the measured copies/ well and the associated uncertainty, the measured copies/L of influent and its uncertainty, and the method LOD/LOQ as it applied to the sample.
Retrospectively the calibration statistical information was examined using a control-chart approach to identify periods where the analytical process was under effective control for each of the three targets (N1, N2, PMMoV). After an initial period of method refinement, most analyses appeared acceptable with few outliers. The quality of the calibration as reflected in the qPCR efficiency (10- 1/m -1), the r-squared value, or the standard error all indicated the same subset of suspect calibrations. We chose a standard error of 0.8 (log copies/well) as an upper limit of acceptance of the analytical data corresponding to LOD < 8 copies/well. The datafile was filtered to remove samples associated with unaccept­ able calibrations based on the standard error. In most cases, an unac­ ceptable calibration with one target also had unacceptable calibrations with other targets. Additional filtering removed replicate rows to give unique rows for station, date, and target. Most samples produced values for all three targets.
2.5. Sewershed and epidemiological data handling
The sewersheds are located in the Capital Regional District (CRD) and Regional District of Nanaimo (RDN). Maps of the sewersheds and populations served at each WWTP were produced by CRD and RDN. The Vancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA) is subdivided into Local Health Authorities (LHA) and further subdivided into Community Health Service Areas (CHSA). VIHA provided case data by CHSA based on episode reporting (reported date of first symptoms or date of first

positive test result) within a defined epiweek (Sunday - Saturday). Historically, the sewersheds and the CHSAs are associated with munic­ ipal and other local boundaries so there is an overlap of CHSA bound­ aries with sewershed boundaries. However, rural properties within a CHSA may not be served by the associated sewersheds. The rural pro­ portion in the CHSAs that comprise the Greater Victoria and Greater Nanaimo sewersheds is less than 2%. The Saanich Peninsula WWTP serves three CHSA. One of these (Town of Sidney) is fully served by the SP sewershed. A second (North Saanich) is 45-55% served by the sew­ ershed with the balance on rural septic systems; the case counts from the North Saanich CHSA were scaled by 50%. The third CHSA (Central Saanich, population 19,330) is 80-85% served by WWTPs with the balance on rural septic systems. No scaling of the case counts was done to correct for the rural population. The Tsawout First Nation, whose population of 1,600 lies within this CHSA, operates an independent WWTP. In the absence of finer grained case data, cases that may have occurred within this subpopulation are included in the case total for this CHSA even though they would not contribute to the viral loading at the SP WWTP. The French Creek WWTP serves two municipalities - Parks­ ville and Qualicum - that are almost entirely on the sewershed. The WWTP is in an unincorporated area of French Creek between the two urban centers and serves an additional population of approximately 1000 not associated with either municipality. The case counts for this subpopulation are included in the Oceanside Rural CHSA (population 24,930). The Oceanside Rural case counts were not included so any cases in the French Creek subpopulation are not included in the total for the WWTP.
The total cases by epiweek were determined for each of the WWTPs and were converted to cases per week per 100,000 population based on the populations served by the sewershed. Most samples were collected from Sunday to Monday, so the sample dates were assigned to the pre­ ceding week.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Characteristics of the dataset
The available data has several internal characteristics: 1) Influent samples (24-h composites) were obtained as subsamples of regulatory monitoring from four WWTP. While we used 24-h com­ posite influent wastewater samples, recent research suggests that sam­ pling sludge contains a majority of the enveloped virus (Balboa et al., 2021) especially if clinical case counts are low (Balboa et al., 2021; Developing a Wastewater Surveillance Sampling Strategy, 2022). Col­ lecting solids requires specialized equipment that was not uniformly available at the four sampling locations (Fitzgerald et al., 2021; D'Aoust et al., 2021). Our sampling was aligned with pre-existing regulatory and operational sampling methods used for monitoring by the WWTP op­ erators. Although these four sources represent roughly half the popu­ lation of Vancouver Island, they differ in numbers of clients served by a factor of ten (Mcloughlin Point Greater Victoria. 300,000, MCL; Greater Nanaimo, 100,000, GN; Saanich Peninsula, 33,000, SP; French Creek, 28,000, FC). The case rates for each sewershed are derived from Com­ munity Health Service Area (CHSA) data that generally overlap sew­ ershed areas but include significant rural populations not served by the SP and FC WWTPs. 2) The samples were fractionated by two different methods based on either skim milk fractionation (SMF; 34% of samples) (Philo et al., 2022) or PEG precipitation (PEG, 66%) (Wu et al., 2021). Within each type there were differences in initial, reconstitution, and final elution vol­ umes as methods were refined. Roughly 90% of the samples in the final dataset were processed with one of two closely related PEG methods or one of three closely related SMF methods. Since the volumes and volu­ metric precision within each method varies, the propagated dilution factors varied; the propagated volumetric uncertainties were relatively constant (8.0 - 8.2% RSD).

3) Three targets were analyzed. N1 and N2 primer sequences for SARS-CoV-2 (Real-time RT-PCR Primers and Probes for COVID-19; CDC 2022) targeting the nucleocapsid gene and the primer sequence target­ ing the replication associated protein for PMMoV. A calibration curve was made for each individual qPCR plate: each qPCR analysis contained one calibration dilution sequences for all three targets, and each set of samples was determined relative to the calibration from the same qPCR analysis. Day-to-day variations in the slope, intercept, and regression statistics of the linear CT as f(log copies/well) calibration were moni­ tored and provided the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantifi­ cation (LOQ) for each sample. Samples that failed to amplify or were amplified to a level below the LOD were flagged as not detected (ND); samples amplified to a level between the LOD and LOQ were flagged as detected not quantified (DNQ). Retrospectively, calibrations were examined to reject those that lay outside a control chart band based on 90% probability of the mean of the standard errors in y of the regression. Within the accepted dataset the uncertainty in the qPCR replicates on a single plate is 16% RSD.
We had anticipated using PMMoV normalized values of N1 and N2 concentrations as others have employed (Feng et al., 2021; D'Aoust et al., 2021). PMMoV is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single stranded RNA virus that is known for its extraneous stability and for being the most abundant human virus shed through stool resulting in its preva­ lence in sewer systems globally (Symonds et al., 2018; Kitajima et al., 2018). Using a gene sequence from the replication-associated protein for amplification, PMMoV concentrations show little seasonality making it a useful fecal indicator (Symonds et al., 2018). In the event, the dataset contains a large proportion of ND and DNQ samples for SARS-CoV-2 targets N1 and N2. Table 2 gives an overview of the dataset from the perspective of the numbers of samples available, detected, and quanti­ fied. The PMMoV target was quantified in all samples done in parallel with the N1/N2 targets. Fig. 1 panel A includes PMMoV values from 125 independent samples and replicates for the four sewersheds. There are a few outliers, but the values are generally clustered with only a small trend to higher values during the period (dashed line). The histogram distribution of values (Fig. 1 panel B) is log-normal (r-sq = 0.978) with a mean of log (PMMoV gc/L) = 7.48 ± 0.34.
At the time of the study design - during summer and fall of 2020 - we did not have access to a reference virus, such as 299E, OC43 bovine coronavirus (BCoV) to assess recovery efficiency of the methods. How­ ever, using aRNA added to samples that were otherwise ND for both N1 and N2 suggest a recovery of 7.0 ± 2.4% (RSD 34%). These spiked samples have a mean PMMoV concentration of log(copies PMMoV) = 7.47 indicating that the spiked experiments were consistent with the larger population of samples. A current challenge with WBE for COVID19 remains the lack of standard protocols for each step in the methods (Ibrahim, 2020; Pulicharla et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2022) but interlab studies show that different methods can be used to give comparable outcomes (Developing a Wastewater Surveillance Sampling Strategy, 2022; Phase 1 Inter-Laboratory Study - Canadian Water Network, 2022). Here, the PMMoV replicates show no significant differences be­ tween the two fractionation methods (SMF or PEG). Replicate samples analysed on the same plate have a relative uncertainty of ± 24% in the mean, consistent with the propagated uncertainty in the individual

analyses (16%) and the volumetric precision of the extraction (8%). Replicate samples from independent methods and/or independent ex­ tractions of a common field sample have an uncertainty of ± 34% RSD. This value aligns with the spiked sample uncertainty. We conclude that the internal consistency of the PMMoV portion of the dataset mirrors the internal consistency of the N1 and N2 values quantified.
Fig. 2 shows the time distribution of quantified and detected samples together with an indication of the LOD for the ND samples; an equivalent figure for N2 is given as supporting information. The quantified samples comprise only 10% (N1) or 7.6% (N2) of the total samples analyzed. With the DNQ samples included, the detected samples comprise 22% (N1) or 16% (N2) samples.
4.2. Correlation of SARS-CoV-2 markers and case rates
Fig. 2B shows the overall case rate (cases per week per 100,000 population) as it applies to the 461,000 clients served by the four sew­ ersheds. During the period of the "Delta wave" overall case rates did not exceed 60 per 100,000 and fell to less than 2 per week at the end of the period (6-7 cases/day/100,000) on Vancouver Island as a whole. While health data show the presence of cases, this is not always observed in our data. Some of the cases on Vancouver Island occurred in places where a proportion of the population live outside sewershed service areas within a CHSA. This discrepancy will not allow the sampling at the WWTP to have a clear overlap with the population case rate in that specific area. Focusing only on the timing of quantified samples in the whole dataset, there may be a correlation between overall case rates and the concen­ tration of the target quantified.
Fig. 3 panels A and B show a correlation of the observed concen­ trations as a function of the overall case rate of the region (filled circles with error bars). The slope of the correlation is relatively flat and the extrapolated intercept implies a viral concentration in the absence of cases. This type of behavior was noted by Fitzgerald et al. (2021) for similar sized WWTPs in Scotland. Fitzgerald et al noted that the con­ centration observed was in part dependent upon the influent flow at the various sampling locations and times and recommended the use of influent flux to correct for this variation (flux = influent flow during the sampling period x measured concentration). Testing flux is beneficial as it accounts for weather (the abundant amount of rainfall the Vancouver

Island gets) and the flow of larger WWTPs thus, better representing each station.
Fig. 3 panels C and D give the correlation of influent flux as a func­ tion of total cases. These latter correlations are more acceptable in the sense that the intercept in the case of N1 is close to zero, but there is considerable scatter. The number of quantified samples is simply too low to support this type of direct correlation of our data.
Fig. 3 also includes samples that were detected but not quantified as they fell between the method LOD and LOQ. These values appear to lie mostly within the confidence interval of the weak correlation with quantified samples. We cannot include the values as part of a direct correlation but could explore the data using rank correlations based upon the relative ranking of the values, rather than their magnitude. Spearman rank correlation gave rho = 0.3142 (p = 0.0852) for N1 and rho = 0.5205 (p=0.1089) for N2. These values indicate a weak correlation.
The overall dataset includes data from four independent WWTPs and, as shown in Fig. 2, the progress of the "wave" of cases differed between the four locations in the period. The effect of this additional source of variance was examined using a Poisson generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace Approximation; glmerMod() function in R) to account for clustering across the sew­ ersheds. The flux data were scaled by a factor of 108 to reduce their magnitude for modelling while preserving the rank order. Table 3 gives the model outputs. Two features are significant: (i) the slope (flux correlated by cases) is significant (N1) or highly significant (N2); and (ii) the intercepts (cases in the absence of a viral flux) are positive and highly significant for both markers. These both agree with the visual summary of Fig. 3C and D.
The very high proportion of samples not detected includes two types of samples. The first are those samples which were not amplified in the PCR. Whether these samples are not amplified due to some experimental mishap, or due to the true absence of viral target in the sample, is immaterial; these are truly not detected. A second smaller group of samples are those where there is some amplification of the viral target from the sample, but the extent of amplification is insufficient to meet the analytical acceptance criteria applied. These samples are screened out at the instrument level when the amount of amplification fails to reach a set CT limit, or the number of amplified wells in the replicates is

fewer than three. These are further screened by the analytical detection limit; a sample may have been amplified in three replicates, but the value is lower than the limit of detection. These samples are amplified but were counted the same as the not detected samples in Table 2. Table 4 gives the counts of samples simply in terms of amplified or not amplified by PCR based all three triplicate samples giving an accepted CT value at the instrument. The overall proportion of amplified samples is 32% for N1 and 28% for N2, a significant increase from the more stringent analytical focus on quantified samples (11% and 8% for N1 and N2 respectively).
A focus on amplified/not amplified requires a shift in perspective to binary statistics to explore the utility of the dataset. This is akin to binary diagnostic testing where a test result (positive/negative) is used to infer the level of a continuum parameter (cases) with respect to a cut-off value. In this context, we know that there was some level of COVID19 infection throughout the period at all sample locations. A perfect diagnostic would return the result "amplified" for most of the samples. In our real case the question is - what level of cases is required to ensure viral material is amplified in PCR? The optimum cut-point in case rate was determined by optimization of the area under the Receiver Oper­ ating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The cupointr() function in R was used for the ROC analysis and to calculate the Youden statistic to identify the optimal cut point for the number of cases needed from the case rate data to detect a positive result in the sample. The ROC curve plots the sensitivity as a function of (1- specificity) (Fig. 4). A highly specific and

sensitive diagnostic ROC curve will approach the (1,0) corner of the plot; a non-specific and insensitive diagnostic will produce a curve on the diagonal.
The analysis computes true and false positives and negatives at the optimal cut-point (N1 19, N2 16.3 cases/week/100K). True positives (TP; N1 36, N2 31) are observations where the sample is amplified, and is correctly identified above the cut-point. False negatives (FN; N1 10, N2 10) are samples which are amplified but incorrectly classified above the cut-point. True negatives (TN; N1 72, N2 65) are observations of non-detects correctly identified as less than the cut-point. False positives (FP; N1 25, N2 38) occur as non-detects incorrectly classified less than the cut-point. Sensitivity (TP/(TP+FN) at the cut-point is 0.783 or 0.756 for N1 or N2 respectively. Specificity (TN/(TN+FP) at the cut-point is 0.742 or 0.631 for N1 or N2 respectively. The Youden J (Sensitivity + Specificity -1) reaches a maximum at the optimal cut-point (N1 0.525, N2 0.387). The overall accuracy ((TP+TN)/total observations) is 0.755 for N1 and 0.667 for N2.
The ROC analysis is consistent with the analysis of the quantitative data given above. The non-zero intercept of the Poisson analysis strongly indicates that our method cannot detect cases below some threshold. Above that threshold, cases are correlated with detected samples based on the observed influent flux. The binary ROC analysis indicates that there is an optimal cut-point of cases per 100,000 per week based on the binary sorting of the dataset into amplified and non-amplified samples.
At the optimum, this binary decision provides an accuracy of 75% for

N1 or 67% for N2. That difference is probably significant based on the lower specificity of N2 relative to N1. The observed difference in cutpoints (19 and 16.3 for N1 and N2 respectively) is probably not signif­ icant as the Youden J passes through a broad maximum between 16 and 20 cases per week/100,000 for both targets. The ROC analysis is limited by the number of unique values of case counts. Although the dataset includes over 140 samples each for N1 and N2 (Table 2), between the four stations there are only 58 unique values of cases per week/100,000. This is adequate for Fig. 4 but limits analysis of individual WWTP results where as few as 10 unique values of cases are available at some stations.
Robust exploration of the cut-off value to apply to individual WWTPs would require significantly more cases than were experienced on Van­ couver Island, a longer duration study and increased samples per week. Feng et al suggest that a minimum of two samples a week are needed to maintain a reliable trend analysis (Feng et al., 2021). Additional work will be required to establish if a site-specific ROC curve for each WWTP

is required. It is clear that a richer dataset will be required to explore beyond the weekly survey results we report.
5. Conclusion
We can draw two types of general conclusions from the data pre­ sented. The first is the value of influent viral marker flux (copies/day) in place of the more usually reported use of viral marker concentrations (copies/volume). Our results strongly support the suggestion of Fitz­ gerald et al. (2021) that flux provides a direct normalization across multiple locations. In our case, the seasonal variation of influent flow is correctly removed from the variance in the concentration data as seen in the near-zero intercept in the correlation of case rates and viral flux. Normalization with measured PMMoV is an indirect method to make this type of correction; direct use of WWTP data appears more effective.
The second conclusion is the identification of a cut-point in cases below which both the sensitivity and the specificity of the method decline to make the positive identification of cases from measured marker amplification unreliable. The actual values we determine are of lesser value than the clear indication that there is a lower limit of cases that can be identified from WBE data. Analytical limits of detection and quantification apply to WBE above some threshold; the ROC analysis, based solely on amplified/not amplified within defined instrument criteria, points to an effective lower limit of identification of cases by WBE methods. In regions with high population density, large volume WWTPs, and high case rates, quantitative correlations are possible. In regions like ours - lower population density, smaller volume WWTP and periods of low disease incidence, identification of cases from WBE

Abstract
Background: As a result of COVID-19, numerous adaptations were made to health care delivery, including comprehensive medication management (CMM) delivered in community pharmacies.
Objective: Identify and describe the adaptations that have been made to the delivery of CMM among community pharmacies due to COVID-19.
Methods: Community pharmacies participating in a CMM implementation and research initiative had regular coaching calls throughout COVID-19 and completed a survey of changes that occurred as a result of COVID-19. Coaching notes and survey results were summarized and mapped to the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-Enhanced (FRAME) to systematically capture changes that occurred.
Results: A number of reactive adaptations were made to CMM delivery as a result of COVID-19, including increased virtual or remote delivery of CMM, delaying CMM visits to allow pharmacies to provide care directly related to the pandemic including COVID-19 testing and vaccines, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) in visits, new ways of obtaining clinical patient information, and shifting CMM staffing models.
Conclusion: Adaptations that occurred to CMM during COVID-19 allowed pharmacists to continue to serve their patients and meet public health needs.

implementation has limited its ability to benefit vulnerable patients. Implementation of CMM in community pharmacies presents both unique opportunities to reach patients and challenges.5 Community pharmacies provide existing relationships, easy access points to care, and unique perspective on medication use behaviors and patient preferences. However, barriers to patient access to care include creating time for CMM, partnering with the care team, and connecting health information.
Research within the field of implementation science has demonstrated that evidence-based interventions, such as CMM, are often modified to address differences between the context in which they were developed and studied, and the context into which they are ultimately implemented.6 Adaptations are critical to successfully implementing evidence-based practices in a specific context.7 Adaptations can be planned to improve fit in a particular setting or context, or reactive in response to challenges that arise. Recent literature has pointed to the opportunities and strategies for adaptations in implementing CMM in community pharmacy.8
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to rapid and significant changes in health care delivery. During the pandemic, adaptations to overcome challenges within the community pharmacy setting provide a unique perspective on prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery during the pandemic.9 Although much has been written about adaptations to medication dispensing activities in community pharmacies, there is less documentation of adaptions to the delivery of CMM in this setting. Understanding adaptations implemented in the pandemic may offer lessons for sustained innovations in implementing CMM in community pharmacies beyond the duration of the pandemic to improve patient care. The objective of this study was to identify and describe the adaptations made to the delivery of CMM to patients as a result of the COVID19 pandemic among a group of community pharmacies.
Methods
This study took place from March to December of 2020 and was part of a larger study to measure the adoption, implementation, and impact of CMM in a value-based care model in community pharmacies. Value-based care models focus on the quality of care provided, rather than the volume of patient services. HealthPartners, an integrated health care organization in Minnesota, launched an innovative program supporting CMM services through their pharmacy Partners in Excellence (PIE) program in 2015. The parent study, an 18-month implementation and research initiative named Slice of PIE, was initiated in November 2019. Slice of PIE was developed to build community pharmacist engagement in the PIE program through education and collaboration in an overall effort to improve patient care and help pharmacists achieve clinical performance and patient engagement goals. All pharmacies within the HealthPartners CMM network were invited to participate in Slice of PIE. Of all community pharmacy organizations that were participating in PIE at the beginning of the study period, all but one organization participated in Slice of PIE. A total of 12 organizations and 45 pharmacists within those organizations chose to participate. Six organizations were chain pharmacies (chain defined as having three or more pharmacy locations) and six were independent pharmacies. Slice of PIE provided participating pharmacies an implementation structure and educational support, such as

Journ al P re-proof

regular webinars to connect with other organizations, coaching calls with an implementation coach, and data and feedback to guide their CMM development and implementation.
Data Collection
Adaptations were collected through field notes documented by implementation coaches during their regular coaching calls, which occurred approximately every one to two months. Coaches worked with sites during the time of the collaborative by providing additional support surrounding implementing the Slice of PIE program into their site, including troubleshooting issues, coordinating collaboration between sites, and assisting with clarifying outstanding questions. The implementation coaches worked closely together, as they worked for the same organization and used a consistent coaching model when interacting with sites during coaching calls. To gather information from sites regarding adaptations, these questions were integrated into their regular coaching calls
A survey was administered to the lead pharmacist at all participating Slice of PIE pharmacies via Qualtrics to gather changes to CMM as a result of COVID-19, which addressed staffing and delivery of CMM, other medication management services provided at the site, and strategies used to collect clinical data for CMM delivery. This survey included 23 items that varied from yes or no questions to free response/select all that apply questions to allow sites to describe their adaptations. Sites were asked to reflect and respond on the adaptations pre- and post-COVID-19 in a single survey.
Design
In 2013, Stirman and colleagues created a system for classifying the types of adaptations that are made when interventions or services are implemented.6 In 2019, this framework was expanded upon to create the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-Enhanced (FRAME).7 The FRAME not only characterizes adaptations and modifications, but captures the complex factors that contribute to them as well. According to the FRAME, the following eight aspects should be reported, (1) when in the implementation process the modification was made, (2) whether the modification was planned/proactive or unplanned/reactive, (3) who determined that the modification should be made, (4) what is modified, (5) at what level of care delivery the modification is made, (6) type or nature of context or content-level modifications, (7) the extent to which the modification is fidelity-consistent, and (8) the reasons for the modification.7 The survey previously described was not structured by the frame, so survey data and field notes were mapped to FRAME by two researchers (CMB and DLP) and discussed with the rest of the research team to systematically capture changes to CMM delivery that occurred as a result of COVID-19.
The University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board determined that this project did not require review.
Results
A total of 11 organizations responded to the survey and field notes were reviewed for all 12 organizations. Table 1 illustrates the characteristics of the pharmacies participating in Slice of

PIE, including the staffing model, strategies for collecting clinical data, and extent of other medication management services provided by the organization. Most of the pharmacies participating were independently owned; however, the study did include three large chain grocery establishments that operated multiple sites. Nearly all of the responding organizations also provided services through Medicare Part D MTM vendors, including DocStation, Outcomes, Medwise, and Tabula Rasa. Figure 1 displays changes that occurred before and after the emergence of COVID-19, including proportion of initial and follow-up visits delivered remotely, and proportion of CMM patients monitoring blood pressure at home. Each aspect of the FRAME is outlined in Table 2 describing the adaptations made to CMM among community pharmacies during COVID-19.
The first three components of the FRAME address when adaptations were made, whether the adaptations were planned, and the person responsible for determining which modifications were made. Adaptations that were made by pharmacies were reactive to the COVID-19 pandemic and organizations were at various phases in their implementation of CMM when these adaptations occurred. Some organizations had been providing CMM for several years, whereas others were earlier in implementation. As a result, modifications occurred during the implementation, scale up, and maintenance phases of implementation, depending on the organization. Adaptations were also determined at many different levels. For example, adaptations were made at the sociopolitical level when the Minnesota Department of Human Services eased restrictions on reimbursement for telemedicine for a number of providers, including pharmacists providing CMM, which was supported by the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy.10 Adaptations were also determined by pharmacy managers, pharmacists, as well as patients.
The next components of the FRAME specify what was modified and the nature of the modifications. Five broad categories of adaptations were made to the delivery of CMM as a result of COVID-19. Most modifications were contextual in nature changing the setting or mode of delivery, but one modification (i.e., increased time between CMM follow-up visits) was to the CMM intervention content.
Increased time between CMM follow-up visits
Pharmacists often followed up with patients when they would come into the pharmacy for a medication refill. However, during COVID-19, many patients sought 90-day supply fills of their medications to minimize outside exposure or utilized drive-through windows to pick up medications. As a result, the length of time between CMM follow-up visits was often extended or did not occur.
Increased virtual or remote delivery of CMM
The setting of CMM visits changed as face-to-face visits were not an option in the early phases of the pandemic, so all visits needed to occur virtually or telephonically. This adaptation is illustrated in Figure 1, where the percent of CMM encounters and follow-up visits that occurred remote or telephonically increased dramatically after the emergence of COVID-19.

Journ al P re-proof

Journal Pre-proof
Delaying CMM visits
Given competing demands, many pharmacies focused their efforts on other urgent tasks, which resulted in delaying CMM delivery in some instances. Early in the pandemic, payers reduced limits on early refills and 90-day fills, and many patients rushed to fill prescriptions in anticipation of supply chain disruption or pharmacy closures. Later in the pandemic year, influenza season and immunization efforts also required a shift in staff resources and demands.
Need for personal protective equipment (PPE)
Another contextual change to the delivery of CMM was the necessity of safety mechanisms for in-person CMM delivery. To protect themselves and patients, pharmacists began to wear PPE, such as face masks, face shields, and gowns, if a face-to-face CMM encounter did occur with a patient.
Obtaining clinical patient information
Prior to COVID-19, some pharmacies relied on point-of-care testing to gather clinical information within the pharmacy, such as A1c and blood pressure. However, this was not a feasible option as many pharmacies suspended these services as a result of the pandemic. Complicating things further, many provider offices were closed or had limited hours and services during earlier stages of the pandemic. Therefore, the mechanism to obtain necessary clinical information had to be modified to either gather it from the patient or rely on previously obtained data. As shown in Figure 1, sites increased their reliance on using home blood pressure monitoring to obtain clinical blood pressure data from patients where previously other means were used to obtain this data.
CMM staff changes
Lastly, personnel for CMM support staff fluctuated during the pandemic as dispensing disruptions (e.g., patients seeking early fills of medications, staff needing to carry out prescriptions to patients' cars) affected CMM operations along with staff quarantining if a pharmacy staff person was exposed to or contracted COVID-19.
The final components of the FRAME include for whom the modification was made, if the adaptations still allowed CMM to be carried out with fidelity, and the reasons for the adaptations. Adaptations were made at the patient level, as well as at the organizational and provider-level. There were a number of different goals driving the modifications that occurred. These include ensuring patient and provider safety, improving patient access to CMM services, and improving the feasibility of delivering CMM given the environment of COVID-19. Contextual factors that influenced these adaptations were local and national public health recommendations (e.g., social distancing) as well as emergent policies (e.g., stay-at-home orders). Despite the adaptations that occurred, this did not significantly affect pharmacists' ability to follow the CMM patient care process.11 Therefore, most modifications were fidelity-consistent with the CMM model.
Discussion

Journ al P re-proof

Journal Pre-proof
This study highlighted some of the key adaptations that were made to the delivery of CMM in community pharmacies during COVID-19. A number of adaptations that were made in the community pharmacy setting are temporary, such as short-term staffing changes and the need for PPE, but other adaptations may be long-term and continue beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, although telemedicine has existed for years, several barriers, such as payment and provider uptake had limited its use to expand access to care in the past.12-14 Yet, with the rapid rise of telehealth delivery of care over the past year, this may be an adaptation that both patients and pharmacists choose to maintain. In addition, pharmacists indicated there was an increase use of home blood pressure monitoring among CMM patients after COVID-19. It is unknown if this will be sustained beyond the pandemic, as well as the effect this has on CMM delivery.
The FRAME was developed based on adaptations presented in a variety of studies in the literature.6 Given the broad nature of the framework, applying the FRAME to CMM delivery during such unique times required frequent meetings with the research team to ensure that we were consistent in our understanding and application of the various pieces of the FRAME (e.g., interpretation and application of content vs context modifications). While the FRAME served as a useful tool to outline the various components to adaptations that occurred during COVID-19, it might be more suitable in future studies to adapt some of the FRAME terminology a priori to fit that particular intervention or service. In the case of CMM, the five components (collect, assess, plan, implement, follow-up) presented in the Joint Commission of Pharmacy Practitioners (JCPP) Pharmacists' Patient Care Process11, for example, may be integrated into the FRAME to serve as more applicable categories to describe modifications that occurred.
Even before the pandemic, community pharmacists were recognized as one of the most accessible health care providers with frequent opportunities to deliver patient care.15 With the emergence of COVID-19, some outpatient clinics had limited hours and/or access for patients, thus potentially increasing the patient need for CMM access during this time period. It is important to note that despite the disruptions that came with COVID-19 and the adaptations that needed to be made by community pharmacies, pharmacists were able to maintain fidelity to the CMM model during this time.
Limitations
There were a number of limitations to this study. This analysis was limited to field notes and survey responses; participating pharmacies may have experienced additional adaptations that were not captured in this report. In addition, the sample size was relatively small and may limit applicability of findings outside of the collaborative. Furthermore, a single representative from each organization completed the survey on behalf of the organization as a whole, and as such, there is a possibility that individual pharmacists within the organization may feel differently than the responses captured by the organizational lead. In addition, recall bias may have influenced participants' responses to the survey. This study was also limited to community pharmacies in Minnesota. Pharmacies outside of this geographic region may have had different public measures in place and variations in outbreak severity that may have impacted their adaptations differently.
Conclusion

Journal Pre-proof
This study is the first in pharmacy practice to systematically collect and report adaptations using the FRAME. Reactive adaptations due to COVID occurred during CMM implementation in community pharmacies. Despite these modifications, community pharmacies continued to provide access and care to patients when access to other health settings and services were limited.

Table 2. Adaptations made to CMM delivery in community pharmacies during COVID-19 using the FRAME
1. When in the implementation process did the modification occur? Modifications occurred within the implementation, scale up, and maintenance phases of CMM
2. Were adaptations planned? Modifications were reactive to COVID-19
3. Who determined that the modification should be made?  Pharmacy managers  CMM practitioners  Patients  State organizations (i.e., Minnesota Department of Human Services and the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy)
4/5. What was modified and what was the nature of the modification?  Some pharmacists preferred to follow up with CMM patients when they came in to the pharmacy for a medication refill. However, with many patients pursuing 90-day fills of their medications, CMM follow ups did not occur as frequently. Therefore, the nature of the adaptation was extending the time between CMM follow-ups in some cases.  As face-to-face visits were not an option in the early phases of COVID-19. As a result, the setting of CMM visits changed to virtual or telephonic.  Delivery of CMM was also delayed as some pharmacies prioritized completing medication fills and providing influenza immunizations during flu season.  The format of CMM visits had to be adapted due to pharmacists' sometimes limited ability to obtain patient clinical data. For example, prior to COVID-19, some pharmacies relied on point of care testing to gather clinical information within the pharmacy, such as A1c and blood pressure. In the early phases of COVID-19, many provider offices were closed or had limited hours. Therefore, pharmacists had to modify their approach to collecting clinical data and obtain patient self-reported values or rely of previously documented values.  The format of CMM was also modified in that if a face-to-face visit did occur with a patient, personal protective equipment (PPE) was required.  CMM personnel also faced adaptations due to COVID-19. For example, pharmacy staff busy filling 90-day orders, taking prescriptions out to patients' cars, etc. Personnel was also limited if pharmacy staff had to quarantine if there was a COVID-19 exposure.
6. At what level of delivery (for whom/what was the modification made)? Adaptations were made at the patient-level and organizational-level
7. Was the modification fidelity-consistent? Fidelity to CMM was maintained despite the adaptations
8. What were the reasons for the modification? Goals

ABSTRACT
Objective: Demonstrate the feasibility of using the existing sentinel surveillance infrastructure to conduct the second round of the serial cross-sectional sentinel-based population survey. Assess active infection, seroprevalence, and their evolution in the general population across Karnataka. Identify local variations for locally appropriate actions. Additionally, assess the clinical sensitivity of the testing kit used on account of variability of antibody levels in the population.
Methods: The cross-sectional study of 41,228 participants across 290 healthcare facilities in all 30 districts of Karnataka was done among three groups of participants (low, moderate, and high-risk). The geographical spread was sufficient to capture local variations. Consenting participants were subjected to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) testing, and antibody (IgG) testing. Clinical sensitivity was assessed by conducting a longitudinal study among participants identified as COVID-19 positive in the first survey round.
Results: Overall weighted adjusted seroprevalence of IgG was 15.6% (95% CI: 14.9-16.3), crude IgG prevalence was 15.0% and crude active infection was 0.5%. Statewide infection fatality rate (IFR) was estimated as 0.11%, and COVID-19 burden estimated between 26.1 to 37.7% (at 90% confidence). Further, Cases-to-infections ratio (CIR) varied 3-35 across units and IFR varied 0.04-0.50% across units. Clinical sensitivity of the IgG ELISA test kit was estimated as 38.9%.
Conclusion: We demonstrated the feasibility and simplicity of sentinel-based population survey in measuring variations in subnational and local data, useful for locally appropriate actions in different locations. The sentinel-based population survey thus helped identify districts that needed better testing, reporting, and clinical management. The state was far from

attaining natural immunity during the survey and hence must step up vaccination coverage and enforce public health measures to prevent the spread of COVD-19.

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally and affected 2.58% of the population, with a case fatality rate of 2.12% as of 4 August 2021. In India alone, 31.8 million people were diagnosed with COVID-19 with a case fatality rate of 1.44% (Worldometer ; covid19india.org). As the pandemic continues to progress, most countries from South Asia to Europe have seen a more severe second wave (Jha 2021; Demonbreun et al. 2021; Ward et al. 2020; Salyer et al. 2021). While data on reported cases, deaths, and testing drive the shortterm management of the pandemic, given the high rate of asymptomatic infection in the population that may go undetected (Kumar et al. 2021), it is important to estimate active infection and seroprevalence in the general population for better matching of public health responses to the actual state of the pandemic (Jewell, Lewnard, and Jewell 2020).
Evidence from nationwide surveys in India, conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), reported that the antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 0.73% population during May - June 2020 (first round)(Murhekar et al. 2020), in 6.6% during August-September 2020 (second round)(Murhekar, Bhatnagar, Selvaraju, et al. 2021) as daily cases and deaths peaked in the country, and in 24.1% of adults surveyed and 27.2% of 10 to 17-year-olds surveyed during December 2020 - January 2021 (third round)(Murhekar, Bhatnagar, Thangaraj, et al. 2021). Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu reported the highest number of confirmed cases at the state level (Statista 2021). Seroprevalence varied from 0.13% in Kerala in an early study ending 31 May 2020 to 31.6% in Tamil Nadu in a study ending 30 November 2020 (Department of Health & Family Welfare 2021; Khan et al. 2020; Prakash et al. 2021; Sharma et al. 2020; Malani et al. 2021). In the first round of the survey in Karnataka, the estimated total burden was 27.7% as of 16 September 2020 (Babu et al. 2021), while a higher prevalence of 39.6% was reported in select households (Mohanan et al. 2021). All states in India, including Karnataka, showed a decreasing trend from mid-October 2020 to January 2021(Government of India 2021b). Further, studies have found declining IgG levels in the general population (De Carlo et al. 2020; Lau et al. 2021;

Robbiani et al. 2020; Ward et al. 2020). Therefore, it is important to assess the active infection and seroprevalence in the population periodically.
While the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization 2020) suggests population-based community survey as the method choice for prevalence and trend estimation, serial cross-sectional sentinel-based population surveys (Babu et al. 2021; Buekens et al. 2020; Zwald et al. 2020) conducted at different time points, provide a more efficient way to gather insights on the epidemiological trend of infection spread. The crosssectional nature provides a snapshot of the state of the pandemic across the survey region. The sentinel nature enables rapid and easier implementation. The serial nature ensures highquality data from the same locations and population segments for capturing trends.
We conducted such a survey across Karnataka for the second time. Given the significant variation in IgG titres in the infected population (Cervia et al. 2021; Dogan et al. 2021; Klein et al. 2020; Lau et al. 2021; Robbiani et al. 2020) and the evidence of declining levels of IgG in the general population (De Carlo et al. 2020; Ibarrondo et al. 2020; Seow et al. 2020; Muecksch et al. 2021; Long et al. 2020), we also conducted a longitudinal study among participants who were identified as COVID-19 positive in the September 2020 first round of our survey (either IgG or RT-PCR or Antigen) to assess the clinical sensitivity of the testing kit, which is the percentage of population identified as positive by the testing kit (Saah and Hoover 1997). This is likely to be different from the analytical sensitivity which is measured in more controlled laboratory settings.

METHODS
The survey
We followed a protocol similar to the first round (Round 1) in September 2020 to estimate the fraction of the population with active infection and IgG antibodies at the time of the survey (Babu et al. 2021).
Setting: The study was conducted in all 30 districts of Karnataka and eight administrative zones of the Bengaluru metropolitan area. This subdivision led to a total of 38 units across the state. Health facilities were selected based on geographical representation, feasibility, ease of recruitment and were the same as in Round 1 (Babu et al. 2021).
Sampling frame: The study sampled three population groups as in Round 1 based on the community exposure and vulnerability to COVID-19: low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups. The low-risk group comprised pregnant women presenting for a regular check-up at the antenatal care (ANC) clinic and attenders of patients coming to the outpatient department in the healthcare facilities. The moderate-risk group comprised people with high contact in the community, e.g., bus-conductors, vendors at the vegetable markets, healthcare workers, pourakarmikas (waste-collectors), and individuals in congregate settings (such as markets, malls, retail stores, bus stops, railway stations, and hotel staff). The high-risk group, or more appropriately the vulnerable group, comprised the elderly and persons with comorbid conditions. It must be noted that the high-risk group is at high risk for the disease and not necessarily for transmission whereas the low- and moderate-risk groups are at low and moderate risks for the disease as well as transmission.
Sample size: For a margin of error of 0.05 and a 95% confidence level, taking design effect to be 3, assuming 32.3% prevalence, which is 5% more than the total burden estimated in Round 1 (Babu et al. 2021), the minimum required sample size was 1050 per unit (Athreya et al. 2020) or 39,900 across the 38 units. The 1050 samples per unit were divided equally (350 each) among the three risk groups and were further divided equally among the risk subgroups.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria: We included all adults 18 years. We excluded those already diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, those unwilling to provide a sample for the test or consent, those who had received vaccination for COVID-19, and those who already participated in Round 1. We excluded those diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection to

estimate the unsuspecting fraction of the general population that were infected with COVID19. We excluded the vaccinated to make better use of the available number of kits.
Data collection: We obtained written informed consent from all participants prior to recruitment. We then collected the meta-data of all consenting participants (demographic details, comorbidities, and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in the preceding one month).
Sample collection and lab tests: For the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) test, we collected nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs. We used the current ICMR protocol for sample collection, cold-chain transport, and laboratory analysis and tested them through the ICMR-approved testing network. For IgG antibody testing, we collected 4 ml of venous blood, centrifuged it, transported the serum to the laboratory while maintaining a cold chain, and detected SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies using a commercial, ICMRapproved, ELISA-based test kit (Covid Kavach Anti SARS-Cov-2 IgG antibody detection ELISA, Zydus-Cadila, India) (Sapkal et al. 2020) following the manufacturer's instructions. Results were declared positive or negative based on the cut-off value of optical densities obtained with the positive and negative controls provided with the kit. Supplementary Figure 1 contains the schema for the laboratory tests conducted, while Supplementary Figure 2 shows the survey algorithm.
Longitudinal study for antibody waning
A longitudinal study to assess the clinical sensitivity of the test kit, in view of antibody waning, was also conducted.
Setting, sampling frame, and sample size: In Round 1, around 4582 out of 15939 participants from all units tested positive on at least one of the tests (the rapid antigen test, which was conducted in Round 1 but not in Round 2, the RT-PCR test, and the antibody test). Of these, 4420 participants from all risk groups with unambiguous meta-data were selected for the longitudinal study expecting that 10-20% would agree to participate.
Exclusion criteria: We excluded those with a breakthrough infection (after Round 1), those that were vaccinated, and those that did not provide informed consent.
Data collection, sample collection, and lab tests: We obtained written informed consent from all participants prior to the study. As indicated above, we collected 4 ml of venous blood from each consenting participant, centrifuged it, transported the serum to the laboratory while

maintaining a cold chain, and detected SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies using the same ELISA-based test kit (Zydus-Cadila) (Sapkal et al. 2020).
Statistical Analysis
IgG prevalence was defined as the fraction of the sampled population with detectable IgG antibodies; active infection fraction was defined as the fraction of the sampled population who test positive on the RT-PCR test, and total prevalence of COVID-19 was defined as the fraction of the sampled population with either detectable IgG or active infection.
For the estimation of IgG prevalence, active infection fraction, total prevalence, confidence intervals, and the odds ratios, we followed the method as outlined in (Babu et al. 2021). This provided the prevalence estimate in the population fraction outside those excluded from the survey (children, previously diagnosed with COVID-19, participated in Round 1, or vaccinated). The IgG prevalence for the entire population was then estimated as follows:
where is the fraction of the population that was either vaccinated or COVID-19 positive. Active infection fraction and total prevalence were similarly corrected to account for the exclusion criteria. For predicting IgG prevalence based on co-morbidities and other factors, we used logistic regression.
The longitudinal study was used to estimate the clinical sensitivity of the ELISA kit. The clinical sensitivity was estimated as the fraction of the recalled participants who tested positive on recall. Considering the significant lapse of time between Round 2 (end-date 18 February 2021) and the longitudinal study (end-date 11 May 2021), the value is only a lower bound on the clinical sensitivity. This yields an upper bound on the total prevalence.

RESULTS
The second-round serial cross-sectional sentinel-based population survey
The statewide survey was carried out in 290 healthcare facilities spread across Karnataka from 25 January to 18 February 2021. Of the 44539 people approached, 115 refused, and 3353 were excluded (based on exclusion criteria), resulting in 41228 enrolments. Among these, 130 had no test results, and 27 had inconclusive results, resulting in 41071 participants with either RT-PCR or IgG antibody or both test results available. Further, 40030 had valid IgG test outcomes, while 1041 had invalid, or inconclusive, or unavailable IgG test outcomes. Similarly, 39779 had valid RT-PCR test outcomes, and 1292 had invalid, inconclusive, or unavailable RT-PCR test outcomes (Supplementary Figure 3).
IgG prevalence: Assuming the laboratory-calibrated 92.2% analytical sensitivity and 97.7% specificity for the ELISA-kit, the overall weighted adjusted seroprevalence of IgG in Round 2 was 15.6% (95% CI: 14.9-16.3), as of 18 February 2021, which is the end date for Round 2 (Table 1). Based on the 6002 positive and 34028 negative outcomes, among the 40030 valid IgG outcomes, the crude IgG prevalence was 6002/40030 = 15.0%. The prevalence estimation takes into account the exclusion criteria and adjusts for the excluded population, as done in Equation (1), while arriving at the total IgG prevalence.
Active infection: The weighted adjusted active infection was estimated to be 0.0% (95% CI: 0.0-0.3) during the Round 2 period. Based on the 187 positive and 39592 negative outcomes, among the 40030 valid RT-PCR outcomes, the crude active infection was 187/39779 = 0.5% (Table 1).
Total prevalence: We estimated the overall weighted adjusted seroprevalence as 15.6% (95% CI: 14.8-16.4) (Table 1).
Demography: The total prevalence among males and females was 15.4% (14.3-16.5) and 13.0% (12.0--13.9), respectively. The total prevalence among 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60+ age-groups were 10.8% (9.7--11.9), 14.1% (12.5--15.7), 17.4% (15.3--19.5), 16.8% (14.3--19.3), and 17.3% (15.5--19.1), respectively. Thus, the total prevalence was higher among males than females and was higher among the elderly population when compared with those aged <30 years (Table 1).
Stratifications: The high-risk (vulnerable) segment of the population continued to be at higher risk (16.8% (15.5--18.1)), followed by the moderate risk (14.3% (13.1--15.6)), and

then the low-risk population (11.2% (10.0--12.4)). In a reversal from Round 1, the rural population had a higher total prevalence (15.4% (13.0--17.8)) compared to the urban population (14% (13.2--14.8)); this is unadjusted for the excluded population due to lack of availability of fine-grained rural/urban case data (Table 1).
Across risk-subcategories, pregnant women had the least total prevalence (8.9% (7.3--10.5)), while bus-conductors/auto-drivers (16.5% (13.5--19.5)), people with co-morbidities (16.3% (14.5--18.2)), and the elderly (17.3% (15.4--19.2)) had higher prevalence. Interestingly, pourakarmikas, who carry out work in less hygienic conditions, had a total prevalence of 14.8% (11.8--17.7) that did not stand out from the general population.
Odds risk for detectable IgG antibodies: The odds for males was 1.22 as compared to females. Across age groups, the odds for the 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60+ age groups, over the reference 18-29 age group, were 1.36, 1.74, 1.67, and 1.73, respectively. The vulnerable population in the high-risk category continued to have higher odds of 1.6 over the low-risk category. In contrast, the moderate-risk category had odds of 1.32 over the low-risk category. The elderly had higher odds of 2.14 over the reference pregnant women sub-category. The odds for the urban population were 0.89 as compared to the rural population. See Table 1 for confidence intervals.
Pre-existing medical conditions: The seroprevalence of IgG antibodies was higher among those with more than one co-morbidity (19.1%), followed by those with one co-morbidity (15.1%). Those who reported having more than one symptom had a higher IgG prevalence (15.3%) than those with no symptoms (14.4%).
Cases-to-infections ratio (CIR): At the state level, for every RT-PCR confirmed case, there were 12 infected individuals with detectable IgG levels (Table 2). This was estimated using the 946860 reported cases in Karnataka as of 18 February 2021. The CIR across units ranged from 3 (Rest of Bengaluru Urban) to 39 (Belgaum), with the CIR of Bengaluru Urban Conglomerate as 6.
Infection fatality rate (IFR): The IFR was estimated to be 0.11% statewide and ranged from 0.02% (Chitradurga) to 0.50% (Dharwad), with 19 out of 38 units below the state IFR. As in Round 1, the Dharwad district had the highest IFR (Table 2). The IFR of Bengaluru Urban Conglomerate was 0.17%.

Districts/unit variations across the state: The active infection fractions across all districts were estimated as 0.0% (with varying confidence intervals given in Table 3). Hence, the total prevalence is the same as the IgG prevalence, with minor expansions of the confidence intervals. The total prevalence was highest in Mysuru district (33.6% (28.0--39.3)), followed by Mandya (31.9% (26.6--37.3)), Kodagu (27.1% (21.8--32.4)), Chamarajanagar (22.6% (17.3--27.9)), and Kolar (20.8% (15.8--25.8)). Other units reported 15% seroprevalence were Bengaluru Rural, Dakshina Kannada, Belgaum, Bengaluru Urban Conglomerate (18.7% (17--20.4)), Udupi, Chitradurga, Davanagere and Bagalkot. Haveri district had the lowest seroprevalence (3.7% (0.5--6.8)).
Bengaluru metropolitan area: Within the Bengaluru metropolitan area (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP)), the total prevalence varied from 13.8% (BBMP RR Nagara) to 24.3% (BBMP Dasarahalli) (Supplementary Table 1). The CIR ranged from 4-8 and the IFR from 0.11%--0.28% (Supplementary Table 1).
Explanatory variables: Logistic regression indicated that the following factors led to a higher probability of a positive IgG test outcome: Other sex category, chronic renal disease, moderate- or high-risk category, attenders of outpatients, transport professionals (busconductors/auto-drivers), healthcare workers, and age 30 years and above (Supplementary Figure 4, Table 4). No significant association was observed between symptoms and the presence of IgG antibodies.
Longitudinal study for estimating the clinical sensitivity of the IgG ELISA kit
The longitudinal study was done from 02 April to 11 May 2021. We collected 648 samples (after removing one duplicate) from 26 units, yielding a participation rate of 648/4420 = 14.7%. The number of samples ranged from 11-36 suggesting sufficient spatial representation. The units that did not have participants were Gadag, Raichur, Kalaburagi, Dharwad, BBMP South, BBMP East, BBMP West, BBMP RR Nagar, BBMP Mahadevpura and BBMP Yelahanka.
Out of the 648 samples, only 370 IgG ELISA test outcomes were valid based on controls. Of these, 144 tested positive and 226 tested negative. Thus, only 38.9% of the first-round positive participants were above the detection threshold of the IgG ELISA test kit during the time frame of the longitudinal study. Given the significant lapse of time between the end of Round 2 and the median time of the longitudinal study (22 April 2021), we deduce that the clinical sensitivity of the IgG ELISA test kit is 38.9% at the time of Round 2.

Upper bound on the total disease burden based on the longitudinal study: Assuming a clinical sensitivity 38.9%, following the same statistical analysis, the total number infected in Karnataka as of 18 February 2021 was 35.8% (95% CI: 34.0--37.7), CIR 27, and IFR 0.05%.
Given the total burden of 27.7% (95% CI: 26.1-29.3), measured at the end of Round 1,[17] we conclude that the COVID-19 burden of Karnataka was between 26.1-37.7% (at 90% confidence) with CIR range 12--27 and IFR range 0.24%--0.50%, as of 18 February 2021. Dharwad's IFR, the highest, ranged from 0.24%--0.50%.

DISCUSSION
Similar to the first round, our present study involves several district and state agencies: 290 healthcare facilities across all districts of Karnataka and the associated healthcare workers participated in the effort. Our study is further unique in jointly estimating active infection and IgG antibody prevalence. Despite the sentinel-based nature of the survey, our sampling frame attempted to overcome bias in the facility-based sampling frame by, for example, sampling from pregnant women coming for a regular check-up and sampling attendees of patients instead of the patients themselves (Babu et al. 2021). Additionally, to account for IgG antibody waning, we conducted a longitudinal study for estimating the clinical sensitivity of the IgG ELISA kit, and this enabled an interval estimate of the total prevalence in the state. We also took exclusion criteria into consideration while arriving at population level IgG prevalence. Less than 0.7% of the population had received one dose and an insignificant fraction had received two doses of vaccination. This fraction is included in the IgG prevalence estimate.
In the first round, overall adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 was 27.3% and active infection was 12.7%. The case-to-infection ratio was 1:40, and the infection fatality rate was 0.05%. (Babu et al. 2021). The estimated IgG prevalence at the end of Round 2 (15.6%) is remarkably lower than the estimated total infection of 27.7% (95% CI: 26.1-29.3) at the end of Round 1 (IgG prevalence 16.8% (15.5-18.1)) (Babu et al. 2021). Tamil Nadu, a neighbouring state, also reported a reduction in March-April 2021 (23%) compared to October-November 2020 (31.6%)(Hindu 2021). In SARS-CoV-2 the initial rapid waning of antibodies is due to the loss of short-lived plasma cells, while the plateau in antibody levels occurs due to establishment of long-lived plasma cells(Zhao et al. 2020). These levels also decline but slowly, and the efficacy of these antibodies is an important aspect of immunity. Assuming the lab-calibrated analytical sensitivity (92.2%) yields an under-estimate of the IgG prevalence in view of IgG level decline (Round 2 began 131 days after Round 1 and 98 days after the active cases peaked in the state). The ICMR third round study (Murhekar, Bhatnagar, Thangaraj, et al. 2021) took two approaches to handle antibody waning - reduction in the optical density thresholds and an independent validation of the testing kit - and reported the adjustments.. We conducted an independent validation via a longitudinal study.

The longitudinal study (conducted on a subset of the recalled Round 1 positive population) yielded a clinical sensitivity of 38.9% during the Round 2 period. The IgG ELISA test used the whole-cell antigen instead of the more specific recombinant nucleocapsid or spike protein antigens (Sapkal et al. 2020). This, along with antibody waning, may have played a role in its reduced clinical sensitivity.
Given the lapse of time between Round 2 and the longitudinal study, the measured clinical sensitivity of 38.9% may be viewed as a lower bound on this sensitivity since fewer days would have elapsed between the date of infection of positive participants and the end of Round 2. By assuming this pessimistic 38.9% value of clinical sensitivity, following the same statistical analysis, we estimated that at most, 35.8% (95% CI: 34.0-37.7) were infected in Karnataka, as of 18 February 2021. Together with the total burden of 27.7% (95% CI: 26.1- 29.3), estimated at the end of Round 1,(Babu et al. 2021), we concluded that Karnataka's COVID-19 burden was between 26.1-37.7% (at 90% confidence), suggesting a significant level of susceptibility (and hence insufficient natural immunity) in the population as of 18 February 2021.
The estimated active infection was 0.0% across all districts. The subsequent rise in infection from March to June 2021 may be due to a combination of effects ranging from immunity waning (Adiga et al. 2021) to the emergence of the B.1.617 variant and its sub-variants (Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium 2021).
Comparison of the CIR range 12--27 and IFR range 0.05--0.11% (Round 2) with CIR 40 and IFR 0.05% (Round 1) for Karnataka suggests improved case identification between Round 1 and Round 2.
As in Round 1, Dharwad had the highest IFR (0.24%-0.50%). This could be due to reporting differences or issues related to clinical practice or travel from neighbouring units to avail critical or tertiary health care facilities at Dharwad (Babu et al. 2021). Further research should explore these hypotheses.
Males continued to be at higher risk than females (odds ratio 1.22), the vulnerable population in the high-risk category continued to be at higher risk than the low-risk category (odds ratio 1.6), those in the higher age groups continued to be at higher risk than the 18-29 age group (Table 1). However, rural areas were more at risk than urban areas (odds ratio urban 0.89 < 1 rural), a reversal from Round 1. Together with the observations on antibody waning, the

higher risk for rural areas suggests that the infection continued to be active in the rural areas after it had subsided in the urban areas during October 2020 - February 2021.
Pregnant women are known to be more susceptible to respiratory pathogens, and hence to SARS-CoV-2, than the general population (Liu et al. 2020). It is, therefore, reassuring to note that the total prevalence among pregnant women was the lowest, suggesting the hypothesis that their behavioural patterns result in significantly lower contact rates.
Serial serosurveys repeated at the same sites can enable the comparison of epidemiological metrics across time. A comparison of IgG prevalence alone between Round 1 and Round 2 suggests that about 17 units have lower IgG prevalence in Round 2, while the remaining 21 have higher IgG prevalence (Figure 1). However, when we compare the total prevalence of Round 1 and Round 2, the latter is mostly lower except for a marginal increase in 11 units (Supplementary Figure 5), possibly due to the reduced clinical sensitivity of the IgG ELISA test kit. Another interesting observation is that while high urbanisation leads to lower CIR (Figure 2), some districts with low urbanisation have low CIR. However, some others have higher CIR, suggesting the need to step up surveillance in those latter rural units (Belgaum, Kolar, Chamarajanagar, and Mandya). Finally, as in (Babu et al. 2021), Figure 3 suggests a possible classification of districts into those with high/low CIR and high/low IFR. Districts with high CIR and low IFR in the top-left quadrant should consider re-evaluating their testing strategies and death reporting.
As highlighted above, the sentinel-based population survey strategy has enabled the identification of trends over time. Such a survey is also easier to implement in terms of planning logistics for quick deployment. The study findings enable identifying districts that need better testing, reporting, or clinical management, all of which ultimately reduce the number of deaths due to COVID-19. Since the state was far from attaining natural immunity, vaccination coverage should be stepped up.
As of 18 October 2021, approximately 62% and 30.5% of the Karnataka population received one dose and two doses of vaccinations, respectively (Covid19india.org). Further, the fourth round of the ICMR serosurvey (Government of India 2021a) indicates that 67.6% of the general population were detected for the presence of antibodies. However, population immunity waning, as reported in many papers and seen in our longitudinal study, suggests that districts which may have peaked during the second wave in April - May 2021 or may have had good vaccination coverage in the early stages of the vaccination drive may require

close monitoring. A new statewide serosurvey will help assess the current state of antibody levels and immunity waning.

Figure legends:
Figure 1 Figure 1: Comparing Immunoglobulin G (IgG) prevalence across Round 1 and Round 2, IgG increased in about 21/38 units (above the line) while it decreased in 17/38 units (below the line).

Figure 2
Figure 2: Cases-to-infections ration (CIR) as a function of urbanisation. Observe that the higher the urbanisation value, the lower the CIR. Some locations with lesser urbanisation also have lower CIR. However, some others have higher CIR, suggesting that these units are missing regions of circulation of the virus and could benefit from increased surveillance.

https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2022-0849 Received August 30, 2022; accepted September 26, 2022; published online October 26, 2022
Abstract
Objectives: The rapid, accurate and safe detection of SARS-CoV-2 is the key to improving surveillance and infection containment. The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether, after heat/chemical inactivation, SARS-CoV-2 N antigen chemiluminescence (CLEIA) assay in saliva remains a valid alternative to molecular testing. Methods: In 2022, 139 COVID-19 inpatients and 467 healthcare workers were enrolled. In 606 self-collected saliva samples (Salivette), SARS-CoV-2 was detected by molecular (TaqPath rRT-PCR) and chemiluminescent Ag assays (Lumipulse G). The effect of sample pre-treatment (extraction solution-ES or heating) on antigen recovery was verified. Results: Salivary SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay was highly accurate (AUC=0.959, 95% CI: 0.943-0.974), with 90% sensitivity and 92% specificity. Of the 254 antigen positive samples, 29 were false positives. We demonstrated that heterophilic antibodies could be a cause of false positive results. A significant antigen concentration decrease was observed after ES treatment (p=0.0026), with misclassification of 43 samples. Heat had a minimal

Introduction
Since November 2019, when severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the virus responsible for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has been clear that the rapid identification and isolation of infected subjects was crucial to virus spread containment [1]. Later, the SARS-CoV-2 large scale vaccination campaign strongly changed the natural history of the COVID-19 pandemic by reducing the number of hospitalizations and deaths [2]. However, despite vaccination, viral spread seems to be reinforced by the highly mutated and more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 lineages, such as the Omicron variants [3]. It is therefore still of utmost importance to promptly identify and isolate infected subjects, as a protective strategy towards fragile subjects at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 manifestations [4]. Molecular testing on naso-pharyngeal swabs (NPS), the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 identification, calls for dedicated instrumentation, specialized staff, and has a long turnaround time and low throughput [5, 6]. Several alternatives (e.g., serology, mass spectrometry and imaging) have been proposed as sensitive and specific strategies for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, and a vast array of point of care testing (POCT) and laboratory-based immunoassays have been evaluated with a view to helping laboratories maximize efficiency in this dramatic scenario [7].
Various POCT self-testing devices designed to save healthcare and laboratory resources have been developed

and commercialized, but their performance has often failed to meet the WHO criteria [8], since their sensitivity is often lower than 80% and specificity lower than 97% in symptomatic individuals [9]. On the contrary, laboratory-based immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 antigen have proven to be a valid alternative to NPS molecular testing, since their sensitivity and specificity are higher than 80 and 97%, respectively. Moreover, with respect to molecular testing they have a lower turnaround time, a higher throughput and call for a more simple sample management process [10]. To this end, SARS-CoV-2 antigen laboratory-based immunoassays might represent a sustainable solution in large-scale testing for the screening of populations (e.g. schools, hospitals) at a high risk of viral spread. Considering all these aspects, recently, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Working Group on SARS-CoV-2 updated previous indications for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, recommending the use of different diagnostic strategies in specific clinical settings, such as labbased molecular testing in high risk populations (e.g. symptomatic patients), POC-based molecular assays or labbased antigen immunoassays in low risk subjects (asymptomatic, hospital admission/contact tracing) or in epidemiologic surveys and population screening setting, along with tentative indications for identification of new lineages and/ or sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2 [11].
In addition to the better testing strategy to adopt, to ensure sustainability, it is important to also consider aspects such as sample type, collection and handling before the analysis. Saliva, self-collected in a standardized way, has proven a valid alternative to NPS, saving time and resources during the collection phase and ensuring molecular results as accurate as those obtained with NPS [12]. Saliva has been recommended especially in asymptomatic subjects and general population screening or to test symptomatic patients when upper or lower respiratory tract samples cannot be collected or for shortage of molecular tests [11]. However, independently from the type of sample collected, sample handling before analysis is still a concern in terms of staff safety, environmental contamination and accuracy of results [13].
The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the performance of a high-throughput chemiluminescence assay for the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 N antigen on saliva samples, before and after inactivation pre-treatment, with respect to results obtained with molecular testing on the same samples, and also to provide practical solutions in the management of samples, for example in a surveillance program.

Materials and methods
Subjects
A total of 597 subjects were prospectively enrolled from January to March 2022: 139 (63 females, 76 males, mean age ± SD: 60 ± 15 years) were hospitalized patients (HP) with a diagnosis of COVID-19, while 458 (345 females, 113 males, mean age ± SD: 42 ± 13 years) were Padova University-Hospital healthcare workers (HCW) who underwent regular SARS-CoV-2 testing for surveillance. The study was approved by the Local Ethic Committee (Nr. 27444).
Sample collection and methods
Salivary samples were self-collected by both HP and HCW using the Salivette® device (SARSTEDT AG & Co, Nümbrecht, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. As some HCW under surveillance provided more than one sample during the study period, a total of 606 salivary samples were analyzed. For 38 HP in addition to salivary samples, NPS were also collected by trained nurses.
Molecular testing: Molecular testing was performed on all samples, saliva and NPS, using TaqPathTM COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) targeting ORF1ab, N and S genes, after RNA extraction (MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit) as described elsewhere [14]. Saliva and NPS samples were considered positive when at least two of three targets had an amplification plot with a Ct value of < 36, in agreement with our previous data [15].
Antigen testing: All salivary samples were tested without any pretreatment or dilution, and directly from the sampling device, for N antigen quantification using Lumipulse G-SARS-CoV-2 Ag kit chemiluminescent assay on LUMIPULSE G1200 automated analyzer (Fujirebio, Tokjo, Japan), following the manufacturer's instructions.
Pre-analytical treatments (heterophilic blocking tube-HBT and deactivation treatments): Samples that were positive at antigen search but negative for molecular testing (false positive results) and adequate in volume (500 µL) (n=67), were mixed with a lyophilic preparation containing heterophilic immunoglobulin blocking substances (HBT. Scantibodies. Part Number: 3IX762), in order to evaluate any interference from heterophile antibodies. After 30 min incubation, samples were centrifuged and re-tested for SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen.
A series of salivary samples with adequate volumes, were also re-tested for SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen search after the following preanalytical treatments: a) addition of sample extraction solution (ES) provided by the manufacturer (20% v/v) to the saliva sample followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min, as indicated by the manufacturer; b) addition of saliva samples to lyophilized ES provided by manufacturer previously prepared in the lab while adhering to the suggested 30 min incubation time; c) saliva sample pre-treatment by heating at 56 °C for 30 min; d) saliva sample pre-treatment by heating at 80 °C for 15 min.

Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis of data was made with GraphPad Prism Software ver. 6.07. Descriptive statistics included mean and standard deviation. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs test was used for comparisons. Nonparametric ROC analyses were used to estimate the area under the ROC curve. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated by means of the user community package "DIAGT". One-way ANOVA and Tukeys multiple comparisons tests were also used.

NPS vs. Saliva: rRT-PCR results

In the series of 38 HP for which both NPS and saliva samples collected at the same time were available, all 38/38 NPS were positive at molecular testing Ct values being lower than 36. Among saliva samples, 36/38 (94.7%) were also positive, the remaining two being false negatives. These two patients had positive NPS results but with Ct values (N gene) equal to 35.37 and 35.51, which were very close to the threshold level of 36.
Comparison between antigen and molecular testing in saliva
A total of 606 saliva samples were tested for rRT-PCR and antigen quantification. At molecular testing, 355 samples (58.6%) were negative and 251 (41.4%) positive for SARS-CoV-2. The detection of N antigen allowed us to accurately distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative subjects (AUC=0.959, 95% CI: 0.943-0.974) classified on the basis of molecular testing (Figure 1).
On using the Lumipulse manufacturer's cut-off (0.67 ng/L), sensitivity and specificity were 90 (95% CI: 85-93%) and 92% (95% CI: 89-95%), respectively. At ROC curve analysis, the best cut-off, of 0.70 ng/L, was very close to the manufacturer's declared threshold; sensitivity (90%; 95% CI: 85-93%) and specificity (92%; 95% CI: 89-93%) were also comparable. Furthermore, Ag levels were significantly correlated (p<0.0001) to Ct values obtained at molecular testing, as shown in Figure 2.
The 92% specificity of antigen testing was due to 26/251 false negative antigen test results. All these false negative samples had Ct values higher than 30 (mean ± SD: 32.9 ± 1.7). On the other hand, 29/355 (8.17%) samples from HCW with negative molecular results had false positive antigen test results, values ranging from 0.68 and 20.13 ng/L

(mean ± SD: 2.94 ± 4.52 ng/L). These 29 samples were from a total of 23 subjects that included four who collected two or three samples over time in compliance with the surveillance timing (every 7 or 15 days, as requested by the surveillance program, on the basis of risk level in their work area: high or low, respectively). Of interest was the observation that the false positivity appeared to persist in samples collected from the same HCW, also in those repeated after several weeks, and that the single HCW values showed no significant changes in N antigen (Table 1).
To ascertain whether the presence of heterophilic antibodies in saliva might be responsible for the above false positive rate, saliva samples of sufficient volume were re-tested for SARS-CoV-2 antigen after the removal of heterophilic antibodies by HBT treatment. The results obtained are shown in Table 1.
We observed a general decrease in Ag concentrations after HBT treatment in 4/5 samples, the classification changing from positive to negative in 3/5 samples, except for the HCW1.

detect Ag before and after pre-treatment with ES supplied by the manufacturer. The results showed an overall agreement of 82.6% (204/247 concordant classification as positive or negative). All 79 negative samples remained negative when analysed after ES treatment. On the contrary, among the 168 SARS-CoV-2 Ag positive saliva samples, 43 were negative after ES treatment (25.6%) with a significant decline in antigen concentration (Wilcoxon matched-pairs: p-value <0.0001) as shown in Figure 3. In ES untreated samples, Ag concentrations ranged from 0.67 to 10 ng/L, and Ct values (N gene) were >25 in all cases.

Furthermore, an overall dampening effect of ES on Ag concentrations was found when all tested samples were analysed (p=0.0026).
Lyophilized ES
To test the hypothesis that the decline in SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection after adding the ES might depend on dilution, experiments with lyophilized ES were performed using 67 saliva samples. Ag detection was not possible in 15/67 samples due to excessive viscosity after mixing with lyophilized ES.

The results of the 43/168 misclassified samples are reported. The dotted line represents the manufacturer's recommended cut-off (0.67 ng/L).

On considering the remaining 52 samples for which Ag detection was possible, agreement was 73.1% (38/52). One of the 13 negative samples was found to be a false positive after lyophilized ES treatment. On the other hand, 13 of the 39 positive samples were negative after lyophilized ES treatment (33%). Before lyophilized ES treatment, Ag concentrations in the 39 positive samples ranged from 0.78 to 5,000 ng/L, and Ct values from 17.5 to 31.9, spanning from a low to high viral load.
Finally, the comparison between Ag concentrations before and after lyophilized ES treatment in all tested samples highlighted a significant decrease in Ag levels (p<0.0001).
Temperature

significant reduction in Ag concentration was observed after treatment (p=0.67), and an overall agreement equal to 93.2% (96/103) was obtained (Figure 4, upper panel).
80 °C for 15 min
Eighteen salivary samples were analyzed to detect Ag before and after deactivation by temperature (80 °C for 15 min). All samples tested were positive before incubation at high temperature. All results were confirmed (agreement=100%) without there being significant changes in concentration levels after heat inactivation (p=0.09) (Figure 4, lower panel).

Based on the above data, considering that ES treatment has a potential effect on test sensitivity, while direct saliva testing offers a highly satisfactory performance, one might embrace the latter option. In this case, however, a strategy to enhance laboratory staff safety measures should be realized. Heating inactivates SARS-CoV-2 virus, but it is not yet known whether it has any impact on antigen testing. We therefore verified any changes under two conditions: a) 56 °C for 30 min, and b) 80 °C for 15 min.
56 °C for 30 min
One hundred and three salivary samples were analyzed to detect Ag before and after incubation at 56 °C for 30 min. No

Discussion
Wide-scale vaccination was crucial to the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, significantly reducing the number of hospitalizations [1]. Nevertheless, with the appearance of new highly contagious Omicron variants, the number of infections continue to grow day by day [3]. Virus containment remains a priority, especially for fragile (e.g. elderly or hospitalized) subjects who, even if vaccinated, are at risk of developing severe COVID-19 manifestations [4]. In addition to vaccination campaigns, active surveillance programs in populations (e.g. schools, universities, communities, hospitals) with a high incidence of transmission and contact tracing have proven effective in containing viral spread [15-18]. Currently,

Figure 4: Effect of temperature on antigen concentration. The antigen concentration was determined before and after incubation at 56 °C for 30 min (upper panel) and at 80 °C for 15 min (lower panel). The dotted line represents the cut-off (0.67 ng/L) recommended by the manufacturer. No statistically significant difference before and after treatment was found.

in order to guarantee the prompt identification and isolation of infected subjects, most surveillance programs are conducted by NPS molecular testing, especially in hospitals [19-22]. However, this poses some limitations concerning both matrix and technique used. NPS collection calls for trained staff, and swab sample collection is uncomfortable for subjects; moreover, molecular testing must be conducted with dedicated instrumentation and by specialized staff and, it takes time to release results also when pooling strategies are used. We evaluated the analytical performances of

SARS-CoV-2 Ag by Lumipulse G-SARS-CoV-2 Ag chemiluminescent assay on saliva samples as potentially useful in surveillance in view of the fact that they are rapid, and easily performed on self-collected saliva.
Molecular testing of saliva is known to be a valid alternative to NPS, with a comparable sensitivity and specificity [23, 24]. This has been confirmed in the present study on a group of COVID-19 inpatients, saliva molecular testing having a sensitivity of 94.7%, and the two false negative samples being from patients with NPS Ct values very close to the

Aita et al.: SARS-CoV-2 Lumipulse G antigen testing on saliva

limit of 36. We evaluated the analytical performances of SARS-CoV-2 Ag by Lumipulse G-SARS-CoV-2 Ag chemiluminescent assay on 606 pure saliva samples self-collected by HP and HCW with respect to those obtained by molecular testing. CLEIA antigen testing in saliva enabled a highly accurate distinction to be made between positive and negative samples, with an area under the ROC curve greater than 0.9, and a high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (92%), in agreement with previously reported data [25, 26].
Then, these data confirm that SARS-CoV-2 Ag detection by Lumipulse G-SARS-CoV-2 Ag chemiluminescent assay on pure saliva allows accurate results to be obtained in a short time interval (about 120 samples per hour, the first result being available after 30 min). We therefore support the premise that CLEIA antigenic testing in saliva should be adopted as a valid alternative to NPS molecular testing in surveillance programs.
The percentage of missed positive cases was very similar to that reported by Favresse et al. [26] on NPS, and in agreement false negative findings were almost exclusively recorded among samples with Ct values at molecular testing higher than 30, expected to be less infectious. The differences between the two analytical principles may explain these data (e.g. Target amplification for molecular testing but not for Ag searching). However high Ct values suggest a low viral load, generally observed after seven or more days from symptoms onset, or in the very early phases of infection [14]. Despite this limitation, CLEIA saliva antigen testing has a sensitivity higher than the 80% level recommended by the WHO [8]. In agreement with Kobayashi et al. [27], we found antigen false positive results in saliva samples. False positive results were obtained among HCW, and in four of them who collected more than one saliva sample, the antigen concentrations were comparable also one week or more later, thus suggesting the potential presence of interfering molecules. We then tested the hypothesis that heterophilic antibodies might be the interfering molecule. The decrease in Ag concentration found after HBT treatment in all (but one) HCW saliva samples, could support this hypothesis. However, other factors such as pre-analytical variables (i.e. particulates or insufficient volume), can affect results [27]. The issue of interferences deserves more investigations to avoid the lowering of assay performance, in particular of the specificity.
In the light of these findings, to limit the potential risk of under-diagnosis due to false negative results, we suggest scheduling SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection by Lumipulse G-SARS-CoV-2 Ag CLEIA with a week's frequency, which is compatible with a diagnostic system that is easy-to perform, fast and high throughput. Considering the results obtained in this study, to minimize the risk of releasing false positive

results and reaching the level of specificity required by WHO [8], it is extremely important to provide molecular confirmation of `positive' samples. Of great interest in this field, is also the quantification of N antigen in blood. Recently, the N antigen detection in plasma by chemiluminescent immunoassay was shown to be useful not only for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections but also to obtain a better discrimination of patients regarding the severity grade if compared to RT-PCR [28, 29].
While ensuring accurate results is the priority of clinical laboratories, it is equally important to guarantee staff safety during sample handling. Although laboratories must comply with safety requirements, using personal protective equipment and disinfectant solutions, and handle samples under laminar flow cabinets thus allowing operators to work safely, it is important to bear in mind that the risk of contagion is significantly lowered if samples are inactivated before handling. In this study we also evaluated the analytical performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection by Lumipulse G-SARS-CoV-2 Ag CLEIA testing in saliva samples after deactivation pre-treatment by means of chemical (extraction) solution and heating (at 56 °C for 30 min and at 80 °C for 15 min). The results obtained demonstrate that the use of extraction solution to deactivate sample has disadvantages, as follows. - It is time consuming, especially in the case of saliva
testing. As the sample obtained after centrifugation has no fixed value (as NPS), the staff are required to measure the sample volume and then add the correct volume of ES in order to guarantee the addition of ES 20% v/v as recommended by manufacturer; this delays the release of results. - The sample handling (cap and tube uncorking) can generate sample contamination and droplets dissemination. - It generates Ag decrease, probably due to sample dilution and/or assay interference. In fact, also when ES was lyophilized, it was not possible to detect Ag in all cases.
The deactivation of samples by temperature, whether 56 °C for 30 min or 80 °C for 15 min, is rapid, easy to perform and ensures safer handling of samples. Nor does it expose the sample to possible contamination, or it significantly impacts on results release times and on accuracy of results.
Conclusions
In conclusion, Lumipulse G-SARS-CoV-2 Ag CLEIA testing in saliva samples has satisfactory diagnostic sensitivity

and specificity, thus representing a valid alternative to NPS molecular testing for the prompt identification of SARS-CoV-2 infections in clinical practice, and allowing the identification of most positive samples, albeit with the potential loss of those with very low viral loads. Moreover, the non-invasiveness and simplicity of saliva sample collection, combined with the automation and highthroughput of Lumipulse G-SARS-CoV-2 Ag CLEIA testing make this solution effective and sustainable when a large number of tests are performed. CLEIA antigen testing in saliva, at least once a week, might be suggested for large scale surveillance programs. Antigen positive results should, however, be confirmed with molecular testing. Samples are readily inactivated by heating before their handling without impacting on the accuracy and timeliness of the release of test results.

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Italy in newborn dried blood spots

https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2022-0948 Received September 23, 2022; accepted October 13, 2022; published online October 26, 2022
Abstract
Obejctives: Serosurveys can be used to monitor COVID-19 seroprevalence and conduct surveillance. Dried blood spot (DBS), used increasingly as a valuable sample to assay severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies (Ab), has several advantages, particularly in infants, due to the limited amount of blood required and its utility in testing a large number of samples in a limited time-frame. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 IgG Ab prevalence in newborn DBS in the Trentino region of Italy, during the time period January 2020 - December 2021. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were determined in DBS by means of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac IgG ELISA assay (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany). Results: Analyses included 2,400 DBS from newborns (54% M, 46% F), samples being collected 2-3 days after birth. The first DBS that tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was found in March 2020 and, up to May 2020, only 4 positive results were detected overall. Starting from June 2020, the positivity thresholds

increased according to the epidemiological waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, with a robust increment in the winters of 2020 and 2021. The percentage of positive DBS rose from 0 to 6% to 10-47%, in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrates DBS is a suitable tool for both epidemiological purposes and surveillance in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, particularly in newborns and pregnant women, saving blood waste and sparing patients any discomfort.

Introduction
Since late December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak has been a great challenge for public health worldwide, including countries with well-developed health care systems. Despite warnings and the implementation of public health mitigation strategies by health authorities, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread (1-5). Specific populations at the greatest risk in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic include individuals with other comorbidities (e.g., cardiac, pulmonary, or neurologic diseases; diabetes mellitus; obesity or immunosuppression), the elderly, pregnant/postpartum women, and infants [1-3]. The prompt and accurate identification of all infected individuals is of crucial importance in controlling SARS-CoV-2 rapid transmission, enabling the rapid isolation and traceability of contacts, and containing the risk of spread, regardless of the presence or absence of COVID-19 symptoms [4, 5].
In the current diagnostic landscape, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the gold standard for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections [6], while serological testing has been successfully used for conducting epidemiological serosurveys, investigating antibody responses mounted against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and assessing the real prevalence of infection in the population [7].
As has been well established, humoral immunity is transmitted from mother to fetus through the placenta.

Galla et al.: DBS seroprevalence in Italy

Recent studies investigated anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies transmission in pregnant women who had active COVID-19 infection or had received the COVID-19 vaccine and found that anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and IgA were transferred to the fetus via the placenta [3, 8, 9]. However, Atyeo and colleagues highlighted that SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody transfer, in third-trimester infection, was significantly reduced with respect to influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies, and SARS-CoV-2-specific transfer was linked to SARS-CoV-2-antibody glycosylation profile alterations [3].
Dried blood spot (DBS) antibody analysis, an alternative method to venous blood samples antibody testing, has already been used extensively in screening for several viruses including Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV [10]. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using DBS for home blood collection for SARS-CoV-2 antibody screening, also in infants [11]. Small-scale feasibility studies have evaluated DBS samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection in high-risk populations, using enzyme immunoassays [12, 13]. More recently a large serosurvey was also conducted in order to monitor population-level dynamics of COVID-19 detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) IgG antibodies in DBS from newborns [14].
In the present study, the newborn DBS sampling strategy was employed to investigate the maternal-fetal seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Abs) using the Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA assay (IgG).
Materials and methods
Specimens
From January 2020 through December 2021, DBS samples were collected 2-3 days after birth from infants born in the Trentino Alto Adige region, Italy. After collection, DBS were stored in a dedicated room under a controlled temperature (18 °C), punched (4.76 mm) into Eppendorf tubes and stored at 2-8 °C until tested. Since all were leftover samples from Screening Programs of Metabolic Disorders, they were completely anonymous, available data including only gender, and no further information (e.g., name, date of birth, demographic characteristics, vaccine characteristics etc.). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Institutional Review Board of the University of Padova (protocol no. 27444).
Quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG
One hundred blinded DBS disks/months were included in the quantification study. IgG antibodies against the S1 portion of the SARS-CoV2 spike protein were measured by Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA (IgG) immunoassays, using the platform for automation Euroimmun

Analyzer I (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions (IFU EI_2606-10G_A_IT_C05, v Nov 30, 2021) [15, 16]. According to the manufacturer, ELISA immunoassay is calibrated against the WHO IS and gives results in relative units (UR) per milliliter and binding antibody units (BAU) per milliliter. The manufacturer's cut-off is: 25.6 kBAU/L (negative), 25.6 kBAU/L and 35.2 kBAU/L borderline; 35.2 kBAU/L positive. In this study, we considered values above 25.6 kBAU/L as reactive.
Evaluation of protein stability of DBS
Five DBS disks/month were taken to evaluate the stability of protein distributions across the analysis time-frame, by quantification of total IgG (mg/L) and albumin (g/L) with the immunonephelometric method on Dimension Vista 1,500, BN II instruments (Siemens Healthineers), following the manufacturer's instructions.
Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism version 9.1 for Windows (GraphPad Software, LLC) was used for descriptive statistics, and for non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman's correlation analysis). Stata 16.1 (Statacorp, Lakeway Drive, TX, USA) was used for Fisher's exact test, and 2 for trend analyses.
Results
A total of 2,520 DBS samples were collected. The quantification study cohort comprised 2,400 DBS spots collected from infants 2-3 days after birth during the period January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2021. Of the 2,400 DBS, 1,301 (54%) were from males and 1,099 (46%), from females. On investigating the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG measured in the first month (Jan 2020), the mean (±SD) level was 13.02 kBAU/L (±3.59 kBAU/L), and all results (n=100) were below the manufacturer's suggested negative threshold (25.6 kBAU/L). Therefore, in this study, we preferred to choose a threshold of 25.6 kBAU/L for reactivity, since the mean + 3 times the standard deviation of the series of DBS results from January 2020 was 23.8 kBAU/L. Tukey's box plots of measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels are reported in Figure 1. No significant difference was found between males and females for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (2=0.002, p=0.968). All results in the first two months of 2020 were below the reactivity threshold. The first DBS that tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was found in March 2020. In March, April and May 2020, only four positive results were detected overall, whilst starting from June 2020, the positivity thresholds increased according to the epidemiological waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, with few cases in spring-summer 2020 and increments in the winters of 2020 and 2021 [17] (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Percentage of DBS tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (chart and table) in comparison with the COVID-19 incidence in Trentino Alto Adige region (dotted line). A significant increase in average of 1.58% (SE=0.094%) was found ( 2 for trend=285, p<0.001).

The percentage of positivity ranged from 0 to 6% in 2020 (23 total positive cases in 2020) to 10-47%, with 252 positive newborn DBS. The percentage of positive DBS significantly increased across the studied month, with a statistically significant increase in average of 1.58% (standard error=0.094%) (2 for trend = 285; p0.001). Positive DBS in females and males did not differ across all studied months (Fisher's exact tests, p-value>0.161). To evaluate the stability of DBS samples, the distribution levels of total IgG and albumin, across the analyzed months, were determined for a total of 120 DBS, 5 disks/month. As expected, total IgG and albumin contents between 2020 and 2021 were comparable. The overall value ranges were 29.05-116 mg/L in 2020 and 27.3-92 mg/L in 2021 for total IgG (Kruskal-Wallis test p=n.s.); 0.108-

0.343 g/L in 2020 and 0.093-0.277 g/L in 2021 for albumin (Kruskal-Wallis test p=n.s.) (Figure 3).
Discussion
The first case of COVID-19 in Italy was officially detected on February 21st, 2020. From that time on, SARS-CoV-2 viral spread caused five pandemic waves that posed a great challenge for national public health systems worldwide. Different studies have modeled epidemic waves, both before and after vaccination strategies, correlating viral spread with pollution, the areas of quarantine and intermittent open-close strategies [18, 19]. These studies, in addition to serosurvey studies, have proven to be essential

tools for seroprevalence assessments and the prediction of immunity in populations, especially those at high-risk [7].
Newborn DBS has already been validated for the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and, since they contain maternal IgG Abs, they might be useful also for evaluating maternal seroprevalence [14]. Pregnant/postpartum women and infants represent specific populations at the greatest risk in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic due to reduced residual respiratory capacity, decreased viral immune response and increased risk of thromboembolic events [8-10].
In this study, we evaluated anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, measured in a series of 2,400 DBS, collected from infants 2-3 days after birth. The levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG towards the S1 portion of the Spike (S) protein were determined by CE-IVD, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
The reactivity rates, determined month-by-month from January 2020 through December 2021, were compared with COVID-19 incidence, geographically matched with the area of DBS collection. As shown in Figure 2, from January 2020 through December 2020, the peak in incidence during the pandemic wave foreran the seroprevalence peak by two months (e.g., April 2020 and June 2020 incidence and prevalence peaks, respectively). That this trend seemed to disappear after January 2021 might be due to the cumulative increase in prevalence in reproductive-aged females with SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the vaccination period. In Italy, the vaccination campaign started in January 2021 for healthcare workers and fragile patients and later, in March-April 2021, for reproductive-aged subjects, whilst pregnant women received vaccines lately, from September 2021, due to the required enhanced safety stringency. However, since antibodies usually persist for a long time, with our data it is not possible to discriminate if the recorded prevalence was due only to antibodies induced by the COVID-19 vaccine or by SARS-CoV-2

infection. The highest value for prevalence, obtained during the first wave (Mar-Sept 2020), was 4%. This finding is in agreement with other results reported in serosurveys in neighboring geographical areas and in a similar time-period. In a study, evaluating 2,602 participants of the Vo' municipality in the Veneto region, a prevalence of 3.5% was registered [20]. A comparable prevalence was found in a further study evaluating 8,285 healthcare workers from the same region [7]. Differently, in two studies considering the Lombardy region, which was a highly hit area in Italy, prevalence ranging from 3 to 43% was found (23,24). Another study from the Lombardy region, reported a prevalence of 11.3% from September 2020 to March 2021 [21].
Since DBS are not usually stored frozen, we performed some stability studies, measuring total IgG and Albumin in a series of 120 samples collected during the entire time period. Results showed an absence of any statistically significant trend or deviations for both measurands during the study period. These findings are in agreement with results reported by Bjorkesten et al. thus supporting the evidence that drying of blood drops does not compromise the detection of proteins and immunoglobulins, when samples are stored at specific temperature conditions [22].
Some limitations of the study should be mentioned. The first is that we did not perform a verification study of the analytical method; however, linearity and clinical performances were previously verified elsewhere by other groups [15, 16]. Furthermore, as DBS were residual material, no other clinical information regarding both infants and mothers was available. For the same reason, it lacked the opportunity to quantify additional types of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (e.g. Abs against nucleocapsid protein, detectable only after infection) advantageous for the discrimination between vaccine or SARS-CoV-2 infection.

On the other hand, one strength of the study is its inclusion of samples obtained from a vast (Trentino Alto Adige) region of Italy and the high number of DBS analyzed.
Conclusions
The findings made in the present study demonstrate that DBS is a suitable tool for both epidemiological purposes and surveillance in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, particularly in newborns, children, and mothers, obviating blood waste and sparing patients' pain.

Abstract Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to a worldwide suspension of bariatric and metabolic surgery (BMS) services. The current study analyses data on patterns of service delivery, recovery of practices, and protective measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic by bariatric teams. Materials and Methods The current study is a subset analysis of the GENEVA study which was an international cohort study between 01/05/2020 and 31/10/2020. Data were specifically analysed regarding the timing of BMS suspension, patterns of service recovery, and precautionary measures deployed. Results A total of 527 surgeons from 439 hospitals in 64 countries submitted data regarding their practices and handling of the pandemic. Smaller hospitals (with less than 200 beds) were able to restart BMS programmes more rapidly (time to BMS restart 60.8±38.9 days) than larger institutions (over 2000 beds) (81.3±30.5 days) (p=0.032). There was a significant difference in the time interval between cessation/reduction and restart of bariatric services between governmentfunded practices (97.1±76.2 days), combination practices (84.4±47.9 days), and private practices (58.5±38.3 days) (p<0.001). Precautionary measures adopted included patient segregation, utilisation of personal protective equipment, and preoperative testing. Following service recovery, 40% of the surgeons operated with a reduced capacity. Twenty-two percent gave priority to long waiters, 15.4% gave priority to uncontrolled diabetics, and 7.6% prioritised patients requiring organ transplantation. Conclusion This study provides global, real-world data regarding the recovery of BMS services following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on healthcare services worldwide. During the early stages of the pandemic, the majority of elective surgical services needed to be paused [1]. There was evidence that recent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) would significantly increase risks associated with surgery [2]. With regards to bariatric and metabolic surgery (BMS), the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorder recommended all nonemergency bariatric surgery be suspended during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. Studies confirm that BMS services were almost entirely paused during this phase of the pandemic [4, 5].

Obesity Surgery

The COVID-19 pandemic arrived on top of a worsening obesity pandemic [6]. Patients with obesity are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19-related disease, and the COVID-19 pandemic has had a further adverse impact on obesity rates due to the repeated periods of `lockdown' and disruption to both medical and surgical weight management services worldwide along with changes in lifestyle leading to less physical activity and more calorie consumption [7, 8].
With the development of vaccines and improved medical therapeutics for COVID-19, we may have put the worst of the pandemic behind us but the critical question at this stage is what lessons can be learnt from the international response to the COVID-19 pandemic and how this may influence the strategic response to recovery of BMS services, further COVID-19 waves, or other global pandemics. Concerning BMS this should have a particular focus on how it will be possible to maintain services or recover swiftly in such eventualities.
The current study has utilised hospital-level data collected as part of the GENEVA study [9-11] to analyse patterns of service delivery, recovery of practices, and protective measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim was to identify the strategies deployed during the recovery of BMS services following COVID-19.
Methods
The current study is a subset analysis of the GENEVA study. The GENEVA study was a global, multicentre, observational study of BMS (elective primary, elective revisional, and emergency) performed between 1/05/2020 and 31/10/2020 in the adult (18 years). Detailed methods have been published previously [9, 10]. This study was registered as a multinational audit at the host institution [blinded] with registration number 5197. The hospitallevel data collected detailed and anonymised information about surgeons, their respective bariatric surgical centres, the effect and handling of the pandemic at their centres, local perioperative COVID-19 safety protocols, and the timelines for the pandemic in their respective hospitals along with the chronology of the hospital response. Data for time points were collected to understand how different practices handled the pandemic. These time points included the first case diagnosed in the city, the first case admitted to the hospital, the peak in hospital admissions, stoppage, and subsequent restart of services. Only practices with all valid time points were considered for this part of the analysis. Data on these aspects were captured from participating surgeons through 28 questions (Appendix 1).

Statistical Analysis
Continuous data were expressed as mean with standard deviation (SD). Data distribution was tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Categorical data were presented as a number with percentages where appropriate. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared using a Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables and a chi-square test for categorical variables.
A comparison of means was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. For these models, only cases with a complete data set were used. All tests were two-sided, and a p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data were analysed using a statistical software package (SPSSTM Inc., version 24, Chicago, IL, USA).
For Figs. 1, 2, and 3, data were analysed and plotted in python 3.9 with in-house written python scripts using numpy (version 1.20.2), scipy (version 1.6.2), matplotlib (version 3.4.1), cartopy (version 0.18.0), and pandas (version 1.2.4). For Figs. 2 and 3, data were accumulated for each day data was reported, on. For clarity, all data was then fed through a low-pass Butterworth filter and the maximum of the data was added to the resulting curve. The smoothed data was then plotted as connected line segments.
Results
A total of 527 surgeons from 439 hospitals in 64 countries submitted data on their practices and handling of the pandemic. Figure 1 gives an overview of the geographical distribution of hospitals included in this study. Table 1 shows the baseline data of the participating surgeons and centres.
Complete data with regards to all-time points were available for 276 unique practices. Only this data was used when analysing the effect of hospital volume or type of bariatric practice over handling the COVID-19 pandemic. All data was found to be not normally distributed.
Effect of Type of Bariatric Practice/Hospital Volume and Handling of the COVID19 Pandemic
Figure 2 shows the timeline of the first case diagnosed in the city, the first case admitted to the primary hospital, and the peak number of hospital admissions according to the practice type. The majority of the practices reported that the first patient with COVID-19 in their city was diagnosed in the second week of March 2020, and the first patient with COVID-19 was admitted to their primary hospital in the same week. Two peaks in hospital admissions were noticed. The first peak was between 09/03/2020 and 12/05/2020 in 192 out of 276 (70%) practices. The second peak was

(09/03/20-04/05/20; peak incidence-13/04/2020; Fig. 2). This was followed by a second peak mainly in the private practices in May/ June (11/05/2020-22/06/2020). This was seen for 50 out of 109 (46%) of the private practices.
Of 276 practices (43.1%), 119 noticed a change in their bariatric practice before the first case was diagnosed in that city. Hospitals stopped their bariatric activity at a mean of 5 days (±27.96) before the first case of COVID19 was diagnosed in the city. Bariatric activity in private and combination practices stopped earlier than in government-funded practices (7.11±29.22 and 7.16±32.01 vs 1.39±17.80 days) before the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in the city.
Hospitals with a bed volume of<200 beds had two distinct peaks of hospital admissions as opposed to hospitals with 200-500 beds, 500-1000 beds, or>1000 beds. The first peak was reported between 09/03/20 and 04/05/20 with a peak incidence on 14/04/20, followed by a second peak between 11/05/20 and 22/06/20 with a peak incidence on 01/06/20 (Fig. 4). Thirty four of 72 (47%) practices with less than 200 beds reported a peak in hospital admissions during the first peak whilst 31 of 72 practices (44%) reported a peak during the second peak. Overall, the second peak in hospital admissions was less pronounced for larger hospitals. For hospitals with 200-500 beds, the second peak was noticed for 26 of 102 (25%) practices, followed by 15 of 70 (21%) for

Factors Affecting the Resumption of Bariatric Services
Figure 4 depicts a timeline of the changes in bariatric activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic and when hospitals resumed bariatric surgical practice. Out of 276 practices (90%), 248 reported changes in their bariatric practices between 23/02/20 and 06/04/20. Peaks in the resumption of elective bariatric surgery were seen between 20/04/20 and 27/7/2020 in 237 out of 276 practices (86%).
There was a significant difference in the time interval between the stoppage/reduction and restart of bariatric services between government-funded practices (97.1±76.2 days), combination practices (84.4±47.9 days),

and private practices (58.5±38.3 days) (p<0.001; Kruskal-Wallis test). The time interval was significantly shorter in the private practices.
The resumption of services was again significantly in favour of smaller hospitals: 60.8±38.9 days (<200 beds) versus 76.8±44.0 days (200-500 beds), 94.3±80.3 days (500-1000 beds), 79.6±51.8 days (1000-2000 beds), and 81.3±30.5 days (>2000 beds) (p-value=0.032, Kruskal-Wallis test).
Precautionary Measures
With regards to the management of patient flow, 266 (50.5%) surgeons reported that they had separate wards for elective and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients, and 103 (19.5%) indicated that patients who tested positive were moved to separate sites. Thus overall, almost two thirds of the surgeons maintained segregation of elective and COVID-19 patients.
Regarding preoperative testing, 359 (68.1%) surgeons confirmed that patients had at least one preoperative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, a preoperative chest X-ray or Computed Tomography (CT) scan was advised by 148 (28.1%) and 108 (20.5%) surgeons, respectively. Preoperative self-isolation was advised by 269 (49.1%) of the surgeons.
The most popular precautionary measure amongst healthcare staff was wearing masks and self-recording of temperature and symptoms (Table 2). Staff members, nurses, surgeons, and non-clinical staff in 434 (82.4%), 435 (82.5%), and 393 (74.6%) of the cases, respectively, were advised to wear masks. Of the nurses, surgeons, and non-clinical staff, respectively, 338 (64.1%), 323 (61.3%), and 393 (56.4%) were advised to monitor their temperature and symptoms.
Of the surgeons, 270 (51.2%) reported that Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits were immediately available, and 81 (15.4%) said there was a delay in availability varying between 0 and 30 days after the publication of the guidelines of the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Impact of COVID19 Pandemic on Bariatric Practice
Four-hundred forty-eight out of 527 (85%) surgeons reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had decreased their elective bariatric surgical practice. Six (1.1%) surgeons had an increase in elective bariatric surgical practice, and 5 (0.9%) had no change. In five of the six cases where surgeons reported an increase in elective bariatric surgical practice, the increase was attributed to the patients seeking weight loss for protection from COVID-19. One of the six was due to the re-allocation of elective surgery to the so-called COVID-19-free hospital. Four-hundred (75.9%) surgeons

reported that elective bariatric surgical practice ceased completely at some time point.
Around 40% of the surgeons operated with a reduced capacity, 22% gave priority to long waiters, 15.4% gave priority to uncontrolled diabetics, and 7.6% prioritised patients requiring organ transplantation (Table 3). Only a minority continued without any restrictions.
Discussion
The present study has provided real-world data regarding the process of recovery of BMS services following the COVID19 pandemic. The study demonstrates that the majority of hospitals stopped BMS operations before the first patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 in that geographical area and that this suspension of services occurred more swiftly in privately funded units than in government institutions.

This study found that smaller hospitals (with less than 200 beds) were able to restart BMS services more rapidly (time to BMS restart 60.8±38.9 days) than larger institutions (over 2000 beds) (81.3±30.5 days) (p=0.032). The reasons for this are likely to be multifactorial. These hospitals may have been less severely affected during the initial COVID-19 wave. Larger hospitals may also have had a greater burden of critically unwell patients requiring more specialist services. These patients are likely to have had more prolonged admissions during their COVID-19 treatment [12].
Another critical aspect of elective surgery recovery following COVID-19 has been the necessity to segregate patients on elective `green' pathways where patients are specifically screened before admission to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. In many instances, this has been achieved through the utilisation of separate hospital sites for elective patients. This was also identified in the current study with the majority of surgeons utilising some form of patient

segregation and almost 20% treating elective patients on a separate hospital site where COVID-19 patients were being managed. This development of separate hospital sites for elective surgery may also provide a further potential explanation of the finding that smaller units were able to resume BMS at earlier stages as these may have been selected as the potential green site for these services. It is to be noted that these green pathways in this study were formulated between May and October 2020, before their value became more widely reported [13].
BMS patients generally do not require a large number of intensive care or high-dependency unit beds compared to other specialities such as cancer or transplant surgery [14]. The majority of specialist equipment (such as laparoscopic equipment, appropriate operating tables, and ward-based patient care items) are potentially transferable between hospital sites. This makes BMS a very adaptable surgical specialty that can be relatively self-contained and is well suited to be transferred to an alternative hospital site as and when necessary.
A further significant finding in this dataset was that privately funded institutions were able to resume BMS services more swiftly than government institutions. Again, the reasons for this are likely to be multifactorial and may vary globally. Many private institutions were also smaller (just under half of the private hospitals had less than 200 beds) and may have been influenced by the factors described above. Furthermore, in many healthcare systems such privately funded hospitals would not have been treating large numbers of COVID-19 patients. During the recovery phase many countries saw close collaboration between private providers and government institutions. In some areas, these private units were specifically utilised as the `green' sites described above to treat publicly funded patients that would otherwise have been treated in government institutions [15, 16]. This form of collaboration allowed for elective surgery to resume much more rapidly in many areas than relying upon government institutions alone.
During the recovery phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, many surgeons were required to prioritise patients to facilitate the appropriate resource utilisation. Many surgeons in the present study (40%) reported that they were operating with reduced capacity compared to the pre-pandemic level. There was some variation in priority groups with some units focussing on long-waiting patients (22.0%), whilst a smaller number prioritised those with uncontrolled diabetes (15.4%) or those awaiting organ transplant (7.6%). This is interesting and seems to be at odds with the guidance provided during the early stages of the pandemic [4, 17].
Aside from the direct effect on surgical services, the COVID-19 pandemic has seen the need for widespread lockdown restrictions which have had a profound negative effect on multiple aspects of health-related behaviours such

as eating habits and physical activity, and other barriers to weight management [18]. There were also major changes concerning how the whole range of weight management services was delivered including access to services and the increased use of telemedicine for care delivery [19]. These changes were welcomed by patients and can improve efficiency for healthcare professionals, and are therefore likely to become part of the long-term care model for future weight management services [20]. Such adaptations of services are likely to be maintained even after the pandemic. However, data regarding the effectiveness of such strategies have been controversial [21], although the majority of studies have demonstrated effective results following BMS during the COVID-19 pandemic [22, 23].
Although the present study has provided an overview of the effect of the initial stages COVID-19 pandemic on BMS services the period of data collection ended in October 2020. As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to progress it has to date been unclear how this has influenced the delivery of BMS services in 2021 and 2022. Data recently published from the National Obesity Audit in England have demonstrated that although the number of cases performed between April 2021 and April 2022 (n=4440) has improved compared to 2020/2021 (n=1854) this has still not reached prepandemic rates of BMS (2018/2019, n=6779) [24]. Data from the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Programme (MBSAQIP) in the United States has also confirmed a reduction in BMS during 2020 of approximately 22.5% [25], but data regarding the recovery of services in 2021 and beyond is awaited. In the future, it will also be necessary to establish if there has been any increase in referrals for BMS which may have been triggered due to concerns regarding the effect of severe obesity on outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection [26, 27].
Significant strengths of the present study are that it provides large-scale real-world data on the recovery of BMS services during the COVID-19 pandemic globally. Despite this, several important limitations must be considered when interpreting these results. Data were self-reported and not externally validated, therefore is reliant upon the accuracy of data input by individual collaborators. Due to the global nature of this study, there was significant variation in healthcare structure across participating centres (particularly the relationship between government and privately funded institutions). Data regarding screening and precautionary measures for COVID-19 was collected before the widespread introduction of rapid lateral flow tests for this purpose, and therefore data regarding their utilisation was not collected. The present study was also conceived and executed before the widespread utilisation of vaccination against SARSCoV-2 for the general population so it has not been possible to assess the influence of the vaccination programme on BMS.

The present study has provided global, real-world data regarding the recovery of BMS services during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract
Background: We developed machine learning models to understand the predictors of shorter-, intermediate-, and longer-term mortality among hemodialysis (HD) patients affected by COVID-19 in four countries in the Americas.
Methods: We used data from adult HD patients treated at regional institutions of a global provider in Latin America (LatAm) and North America who contracted COVID-19 in 2020 before SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were available. Using 93 commonly captured variables, we developed machine learning models that predicted the likelihood of death overall, as well as during 0-14, 15-30,>30 days after COVID-19 presentation and identified the importance of predictors. XGBoost models were built in parallel using the same programming with a 60%:20%:20% random split for training, validation, & testing data for the datasets from LatAm (Argentina, Columbia, Ecuador) and North America (United States) countries.
Results: Among HD patients with COVID-19, 28.8% (1,001/3,473) died in LatAm and 20.5% (4,426/21,624) died in North America. Mortality occurred earlier in LatAm versus North America; 15.0% and 7.3% of patients died within 0-14 days, 7.9% and 4.6% of patients died within 15-30 days, and 5.9% and 8.6% of patients died>30 days after COVID-19 presentation, respectively. Area under curve ranged from 0.73 to 0.83 across prediction models in both regions. Top predictors of death after COVID-19 consistently included older age, longer vintage, markers of poor nutrition and more inflammation in both regions at all timepoints. Unique patient attributes (higher BMI, male sex) were top predictors of mortality during 0-14 and 15-30 days after COVID-19, yet not mortality>30 days after presentation.
Conclusions: Findings showed distinct profiles of mortality in COVID-19 in LatAm and North America throughout 2020. Mortality rate was higher within 0-14 and 15-30 days after COVID-19 in LatAm, while mortality rate was higher in North America>30 days after presentation. Nonetheless, a remarkable proportion of HD patients died>30 days

Background People with kidney failure treated by dialysis are at a high risk of experiencing serious complications if affected by COVID-19. Reports have estimated 40% to 70% of dialysis patients who contracted COVID-19 were hospitalized and 11% to 34% died during timeframes before SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were available [1- 9]. During 2020, the mortality rate in the United States dialysis population was estimated to have increased by 18% compared to 2019 [10]. The majority assessments of mortality in dialysis patients with COVID-19 have limited follow up timeframes for assessing outcomes. Although useful, the timeframes generally investigated do not provide an understating of outcomes overall, as well as in distinct shorter and longer periods after COVID-19. Ultimately, this might be limiting our understanding of the profiles and predictors of outcomes in this special population.
In many countries, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have fortunately become readily available and are being rolled out to the communities [11, 12]. Nonetheless, SARSCoV-2 vaccines have been shown to create a smaller antibody response among dialysis patients [13, 14], and a proportion of the population has not been vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2, and may never be due to various reasons (e.g. medical/religious contraindications, vaccine hesitancy) [11, 12, 15, 16]. Further establishment of models to identify the predictors of outcomes in unvaccinated dialysis patients continues to be warranted, and as sufficient follow up data becomes available, investigations determining the profiles and predictors of mortality in vaccinated dialysis patients will also be needed.
Through experiences in direct patient care in the pandemic, the physician authors made anecdotal observations that dialysis patients with COVID-19 generally experienced the outcome of death either very quickly (within 14 days), or after prolonged periods of intensive care (often>30 days). Ultimately, it was hypothesized this might be signaling distinct causes and predictors of early or prolonged mortality in COVID-19. This investigation aimed to evaluate the profiles and predictors of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients with COVID-19, overall, as well as considering shorter-, intermediate-, and longer-term follow up periods.

Methods
Patient cohorts We used real-world data from HD patients treated at regional institutions of a global provider in Latin America (LatAm; Fresenius Medical Care Latin America, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and North America (Fresenius Medical Care North America, Waltham, United States) from 01-July-2019 to 31-December-2020 to conduct side-byside analyses of the profiles and predictors of mortality overall, as well as within 0-14, 15-30,>30 days after COVID-19 presentation.
In LatAm and North America, we used data collected during the provision of routine medical care in dialysis patients. All data was de-identified for the purposes of the parallel analyses. The EuCliD database was used for capturing data in the Latin America cohort as part of Fresenius Medical Care's quality improvement and management programs in all NephroCare clinics utilizing EuCLiD [17]. EuCLiD governance has established protocols and procedures for use of clinical data from NephroCare clinics for secondary research purposes. Data was only collected from patients who provided informed consent for their data to be collected into EuCliD and the data was de-identified by the LatAm investigator. The Fresenius Medical Care North America Knowledge Center Data Warehouse was used for capturing data in the North America cohort from clinics in the Fresenius Kidney Care network. In North America, data was collected from patients treated in the United States under a protocol approved by New England Independent Review Board (NEIRB; Needham Heights, MA, United States); NEIRB determined the analysis of the North America cohort was exempt due to use of data de-identified by the North America investigator that no longer contained protected health information and consent was not required per title 45 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations part 46.104(d)(4) (NEIRB# 1-1439054-1). The analysis in each region was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Patient eligibility We included data from adult (age18 years) patients with kidney failure who were suspected to have COVID19 before 02-Dec-2020 and received1 outpatient HD treatment (inclusive of hemodiafiltration) before COVID-19 presentation and did not change to a home

dialysis modality during the observation period. We excluded data from patients under investigation who were found to have a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result, or patients who were in close contact to someone with known COVID-19, never presented with symptoms, and were not tested. We also excluded data from patients who received outpatient HD for acute kidney failure, as well as patients who were known to be pregnant during the observation period.
Dependent variables The primary outcome (dependent variable) was all-cause death any time after COVID-19 presentation. The time at risk started on the first date of COVID-19 suspicion where patients presented with signs and symptoms. We defined a 30-day minimum follow up period for evaluation of outcomes across the observation period (i.e. COVID-19 suspicion date before 02 Dec 2020).
Further sub-analyses of the primary outcome considered all-cause death within 0-14, 15-30,>30 days after COVID-19 presentation. We used the same logic for time at risk and minimum follow up as with death any time after COVID-19 presentation. Patients who had a death event in a preceding period were censored from the dataset for analysis performed in the subsequent predefined follow-up period. Therefore, patients who died within 0-14 days after COVID-19 presentation were removed from analyses of outcomes 15-30 and>30 days after COVID-19 presentation. Consistently, patients who died during 15-30 days after COVID-19 presentation were removed from analyses of outcomes>30 days after COVID-19 presentation.
Independent variables We used various patient characteristics, clinical parameters, and laboratories (independent variables; n=93) to define the characteristics of the cohorts and investigate the predictors of death after COVID-19 presentation. Patient characteristics included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), dialysis vintage, etiology of kidney failure (diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, or other), comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, liver disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), and country as of the first date of suspicion/presentation with COVID-19, as well as continuous dialysis catheter exposure90,120, and180 days before COVID-19 presentation.
Clinical parameters included pre-/post-HD systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse, body temperature, and weight, as well as the prescribed dry weight and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG). Laboratories included pre-HD albumin,

calcium, corrected calcium, creatinine, phosphate, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), white blood cell (WBC) count, and WBC differential (% platelets, % lymphocytes, % neutrophils). All independent variables considered were captured and available for patients treated in the Latin and North America countries included in the parallel analyses. The clinical parameters (e.g., vital signs and weight measures) were universally collected before and after HD for all patients in both regional cohorts. There were some differences in the frequencies of select laboratories with some being measured less frequently in Latin versus North America countries. For instance, pre-HD albumin was measured on a quarterly basis in Latin America and a monthly basis in North America.
All clinical parameters and laboratory values considered the most recent value within 14 days before COVID19 presentation, the most recent value>14 days prior to COVID-19 presentation, and the change between the values within 14 days and>14 days prior to COVID-19 presentation (Fig. 1). These timepoints were selected based off expert knowledge in the domain of medicine and physiology and a prior investigation that estimated the timing of physiological disturbances during the onset of COVID-19 [18].
A past work identified disturbances in physiology start about 14 days before COVID-19, with the most meaningful changes in clinical and laboratory values being seen at presentation with the first signs and symptoms of the disease [18]. Therefore, the most recent value within 14 days of COVID-19 was chosen to provide a representation of the patient's clinical status at presentation with signs of symptoms that led to identification of COVID-19. This prior analysis also showed that clinical and laboratory values>14 days before COVID-19 presentation were representative of each patient's "normal" physiology before the onset of COVID-19 [18]. Ultimately, this design for predictor variable timing was chosen to show the extent that disturbances in clinical and laboratory values during COVID-19 onset associate with a death event, as well as show the extent that the historic clinical status associates with a death event.
Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics The patient characteristics in the LatAm and North America cohorts were tabulated by region, as well as stratified by the groups who died or survived after COVID-19. We reported the count and proportion of categorical variables and mean and standard deviation (SD) of continuous variables.

Machine learning model development Given the knowledge on risk factors for mortality in the dialysis population is sparse, has not included continuous data on laboratories and HD treatments, and has not assessed temporal changes in predictors before and longer follow up times after COVID-19 presentation, we decided to use an advanced data driven approach to establish the predictors of mortality after COVID19. This included developing a series of machine learning prediction models using Python software (Python Software Foundation, Delaware, United States) with the XGBoost package [19] to predict the likelihood of death after COVID-19 presentation and identify the importance of predictor variables.
For parallel model development in LatAm and North America, we used a 60%:20%:20% random split of the data on patients who died anytime during follow-up (i.e. positive outcome group) for the training, validation, and testing datasets respectively. Data from survivors throughout follow-up (i.e. negative outcome group) were randomly split between the datasets. Down sampling methods in the negative outcome cases were investigated to optimize the models' ability to learn to identify the outcome from predictor variables considering a 1:1 through 1:6 ratio in the training and validation datasets. Based on our assessments, we chose to down sample the negative outcome cases in only the training dataset to provide a 1:2 ratio of positive to negative outcome cases (i.e. for each patient who died we randomly included 2 patients who survived in the training dataset). The validation and testing datasets were not down sampled and represented the incidence of COVID-19

death observed in the overall HD population in each world region.
The same methods for data splits and sampling were performed for the sub-analysis models developed to predict the likelihood of death in 0-14, 15-30,>30 days after COVID-19 presentation. In these sub-analysis models, we removed patients who died within 14 days after COVID-19 from the positive outcome group for creating the datasets for the models developed to determine the risk of death during 15-30 or>30 days after COVID-19 presentation. Furthermore, we removed patients who died within 30 days after COVID-19 from the positive outcome group for creating the datasets for the models developed to determine the probability of death>30 days after COVID-19 presentation. The negative outcome groups consisted of data from survivors of the predefined follow-up period, and they were randomly split between the training, validation, and testing datasets for each model. All models were developed in a side-by-side manner and used same programming for datasets in LatAm and North America.
For an overview of the XGBoost logic, this non-linear machine learning model used the input (independent) variables in the training dataset to construct an array of decision trees in every possible combination to establish a series of thresholds that split variables to maximize the information gain. Decision trees were constructed iteratively by the model, and new decision trees were added to predict prior errors. The decision trees were inherently able to handle and account for missing values and imputation of null data points was not required. The model determined the presence or missingness of each variable

Guinsburg et al. BMC Nephrology (2022) 23:340

Page 5 of 23

when establishing variable splits in the decision trees for each patient. Therefore, the influence of a missing value was used for information gain in the predictions made for each patient. After the ensemble of decision trees was created using the training datasets, it was assessed using the validation datasets and hyperparameter tuning was evaluated for the overall models using a grid search and 5-fold cross validation method. After no more improvements were achieved in performance, the final ensemble of decision trees produced in the models were used for performance assessments using unseen data in the testing dataset. Hyperparameter tuning and the selection of the final hyperparameter settings in each region was based on the models that predicted mortality any time after COVID-19, and these settings were universally applied to the sub-analysis models that predicted mortality within 0-14 days, 15-30 days, and>30 days after COVID-19. The details on the initial and final hyperparameters and tuning ranges considered are shown in Additional File 1; Supplementary Table 1.

Assessment of model performance The performance of the prediction models was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and balanced accuracy in the training, validation, and testing datasets. The area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) was further evaluated in the testing dataset.
The AUC measures the rate of true and false positives classified across probability thresholds (Table 1). AUC scores are represented on a scale of 0 (lowest) to 1 (highest) with chance being a value of 0.5.
Balanced accuracy is a measure of the accuracy of the prediction that is represented as a percent and considers both the sensitivity and specificity at cutoff threshold of 0.50. This metric can reasonably estimate model performance in data with imbalanced positive and negative outcomes, and is calculated as follows:

Balanced accuracy =

Sensitivity + Specificity 2

 100

The AUPRC measures the ratio of precision for corresponding sensitivity values across probability thresholds [20]. AUPRC scores are represented on a scale of 0

(lowest) to 1 (highest) with chance equaling the fraction of positive cases in each regional group for each model (i.e., the number of patients who died in each group divided by the total number of patients in each group).
The definitions for sensitivity, specificity, and precision are provided below since these metrics are used in the calculation of balanced accuracy and the AUPRC.
Sensitivity (also known as recall) shows the rate of true positives classified by the model at a specified threshold, and the equation for this metric is as follows:
Sensitivity = (true posittrivuees p+osfiatilvseesnegatives)  100

Specificity shows the rate of true negatives classified by the model at a specified threshold, and the equation for this metric is as follows:

true negatives Specificity =
(true negatives + false positives)

 100

Precision shows the positive predictive value for the model at a specified threshold, and the equation for this metric is as follows:

Precision =

true positives true positives + false positives

 100

The final model performance is represented by the AUC, balanced accuracy, and AUPRC for the testing dataset.

Assessment of the importance of predictors We assessed the importance of individual predictor variables using Shapley (SHAP) values [21, 22] that were calculated using the SHAP Python package [23, 24]. The SHAP value determined the feature importance for each input variable by calculating the predictors influence on prediction of the outcome considering the influence of the overall combination of variables in the model.
For an overview of the logic, SHAP values were calculated for each predictor variable at each observation, representing the positive or negative impact of the observed value on the prediction of the outcome for each individual patient. The SHAP methods included and withheld the individual variables in all possible combinations. To attribute feature importance, the SHAP method

Guinsburg et al. BMC Nephrology (2022) 23:340

calculated the mean value of all possible combinations considering differences between included and withheld variables. Notably, SHAP values show additive explanations of feature importance and are reported in log odds (i.e. the logarithm of the odds ratio). To calculate the prediction for each individual patient, the model summed the SHAP values for each variable and converted it from log odds to the probability for the occurrence of the outcome. Therefore, larger positive SHAP values increase the probability for the predicted outcome for a given patient, and larger negative SHAP values decrease the probability. The overall feature importance for each predictor variable was determined by calculating the mean absolute SHAP value across all the individual patients' observations.

In the LatAm cohort, 28.8% (1,001/3,473) patients died any time after COVID-19 during the observation period. A lower proportion of 20.5% (4,426/21,624) patients died any time after COVID-19 in the North America cohort (Table 2). There were regional differences in the timing of mortality after COVID-19, with shorter-term outcomes being more frequent in LatAm and vice versa in North America. Among HD patients with COVID-19 in LatAm and North America, 15.0% and 7.3% died within 0-14 days, 7.9% and 4.6% died within 15-30 days, and 5.9% and 8.6% died>30 days after presentation, respectively (Fig. 3). Univariate analyses showed most demographic (Tables 2 & 3) and clinical (Tables 4, 5, 6, & 7) parameters were related to mortality in COVID-19, especially in the North America cohort.

Results
Patient characteristics and profiles of mortality after COVID19 We identified a cohort of 3,473 HD patients who presented with COVID-19 any time before 02 Dec 2020 in three LatAm countries (Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador), as well as a cohort of 21,624 HD patients who presented with COVID-19 during the same time in North America from the United States (Fig. 2). The demographics of patients with COVID-19 by survival status are shown in Table 2 for the LatAm and North America cohorts. On average, patients in LatAm countries had trends for being a few years younger, more often male, had a lower BMI, longer dialysis vintage, with a lower prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure.

Model performance The machine learning models constructed to establish the predictors of mortality in COVID-19 were found to have suitable performance in prediction of the outcome of death in both regions overall, as well as in the predefined shorter timeframe after COVID-19 presentation (Table 8). The AUC for the model's classification of death at any time after COVID-19 presentation was 0.76 in LatAm cohort and 0.79 in North America cohort, the balanced accuracy was 71% in the LatAm cohort and 70% in North America cohort, and the AUPRC was 0.21 in LatAm cohort and 0.52 in North America cohort.
Relatively consistent AUCs (ranging from 0.73 to 0.83) and balanced accuracy (ranging from 66 to 75%) were found across models in predefined timeframes

P-values for univariate comparison of died versus survived (reference) are shown with bold font representing p<0.05. All patient characteristics presented as of the COVID-19 presentation date

0 to 14, 15 to 30, and>30 days after COVID-19 for both regions. Considering the AUPRC, the model was found to have suitable performance in classification of shorter-term death events within 0 to 14 days after COVID-19 presentation in both the LatAm cohort (AUPRC=0.38) and North America cohort (AUPRC=0.30). Although the AUPRC showed suitable performance in the North America cohort for classification of the risk of death 15 to 30 days (AUPRC=0.23) and>30 days (AUPRC=0.36) after COVID-19, it showed poor performance in prediction of intermediate- (AUPRC=0.06) and longer-term (AUPRC=0.04) outcomes in the LatAm cohort.

Predictors of death any time after COVID19 We estimated the importance of each predictor variable with SHAP values and found the top three predictors of death any time after COVID-19 presentation in the LatAm cohort were older age, higher WBC counts historically (i.e.>14 days prior to COVID-19 presentation), and lower albumin levels historically; in North America, the top three predictors included older age, lower albumin levels historically, and longer dialysis vintage. In Fig. 4, the bar charts on the left side of each panel show the mean absolute SHAP values that represent the magnitude of importance for each variable in log odds; these are shown in descending order

of importance for the top 15 predictors. The SHAP value plots on the right of each panel further show the degree and direction of the effect for each variable on each unique patient's prediction. The SHAP value plots denote a dot that corresponds to each patient and the dot's position on the x-axis (positive or negative) represents the magnitude of that variable's effect on the risk prediction for that unique patient. The color of each dot on the SHAP value plots indicate how large/high or small/low the value is for that variable in that unique patient's prediction. For an example with

the top predictor of age, the mean SHAP values show age has a high magnitude of importance as compared to other variables and the SHAP value plots show more positive SHAP values for dots that had warmer colors (representing increasing age with the warmer the color and increasing risk based on how positive the value is), and more negative SHAP values for dots that had cooler colors (representing younger age with the cooler the color and decreasing risk based on how negative the value is). Age showed the largest contribution to the risk of death after COVID-19; however,

Bar plot in the left panels show the mean absolute SHAP values that estimate the average size of each variable's contribution to predicting the outcome on the x-axis (calculated from the average absolute value for all patients). SHAP value plots in the right panels show the size and direction (more positive=higher risk or more negative=lower risk) of each variable's influence on the outcome for each unique patient on the x-axis, with warmer colors representing higher observed values for that measurement, cooler colors indicating lower values for that measurement, and gray representing a missing value for that measurement. SHAP values are presented in the unit of log odds (i.e. logarithm of the odds ratio)

many variables had a high magnitude considering the log odds values and the distributions of risks in SHAP value plots.
Albeit distinctions exist between world regions in the predictors of mortality any time after COVID-19 presentation, the trends in the top 15 predictors showed many consistent findings with older age, poorer nutrition (lower albumin and creatinine historically), longer vintage, lower TSAT levels historically, more inflammation (seen in LatAm by higher WBC counts historically and a change to a higher % of neutrophils and in North America by lower % of lymphocytes historically and at presentation) increasing the risk of death (Fig. 4). Some regional differences in the top predictors of mortality any time after COVID-19 included lower or missing iPTH historically and presence of diabetes being among the top 15 risk factors in only LatAm, while being male and higher post-HD pulse at presentation were only in the top 15 predictors in North America. Figure 5 shows a further regional comparison of the mean absolute SHAP values for the top 15 predictors of death any time after COVID-19 presentation from both regional cohorts, and Additional File 1; Supplementary Table 2 shows the SHAP values for all the predictors of death any time after COVID-19.
Predictors of Shorter, Intermediate, and LongerTerm Death after COVID19 Assessment of the top predictors of shorter-term death within specifically 0 to 14 days after COVID-19 presentation showed older age, higher WBC counts historically, longer vintage, lower albumin historically, higher BMI, and higher creatinine historically were among the top 15 risk factors for shorter-term mortality in both regions

(Figs. 6 & 7, Additional File 1; Supplementary Table 3). Mineral bone disorder markers (lower or missing iPTH, higher calcium, higher corrected calcium) historically, higher ferritin levels historically, and having diabetes were found to only be in the top 15 predictors for shortterm mortality in LatAm, while a higher post-HD pulse at presentation, a change to a higher pulse, and being male were only in the top 15 predictors in North America, among other distinctions.
The evaluation of the risk factors for intermediateterm mortality during 15 to 30 days after COVID-19 presentation identified consistencies in many of the top 15 predictors of death in between regions (older age, being male, higher TSAT and % of neutrophils historically, and hemoglobin at presentation), along with some regional heterogeneity in some factors (Figs. 6 & 8, Additional File 1; Supplementary Table 4). A surprising contrast in the predictors of mortality 15 to 30 days after COVID-19 between regions included higher WBC counts historically being a top predictor of death in LatAm, while this was opposite with lower WBC counts historically being a top predictor in North America. There was also an inverse association seen with shorter vintage being a top predictor of intermediate-term death in LatAm and vice versa in North America. BMI and diabetes were not among the top 15 predictors of intermediate-term mortality in either region.
The examination of the predictors of longer-term mortality>30 days after COVID-19 presentation found consistency in risk factors between regions for older age, longer dialysis vintage, lower hemoglobin levels historically, more inflammation (higher % of neutrophils and lower % of lymphocytes historically), poorer nutrition (lower albumin and

creatinine historically), and higher ferritin levels being in the top 15 predictors (Fig. 6 & 9, Additional File 1; Supplementary Table 5). Interestingly, we found an inverse association between regions for pre-HD SBP at presentation with a higher SBP being a risk factor in LatAm and vice versa in North America. Catheter exposure for>90 days, diabetes, lower PTH, and lower BMI were uniquely among the top 15 predictors of longer-term death in the LatAm cohort, as well as other factors. The demographic factor of sex was no longer among the top 15 predictors of a long-term death after COVID-19 in either region.
Discussion Among two regional cohorts of HD patients who presented with COVID-19 before SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were available, mortality any time after presentation was 8.3

percentage points higher in LatAm countries compared to the North American country of the United States. Shorter-term mortality after COVID-19 was more common in LatAm as compared to North America cohort, with the mortality rate being 7.7 and 3.3 percentage points higher within 14 days and during 15 to 30 days after presentation respectively. Conversely, longer-term mortality after COVID-19 was more frequent in North America, with the mortality rate being 2.7 percentage points higher than in the LatAm cohort. The series of machine learning models developed in parallel in each region were found to have suitable performance in prediction of death any time after COVID-19, as well as in the prespecified shorter-term follow up timeframes. Albeit we found suitable performance in the prediction of death events in prespecified intermediate- and longer-term periods in North

America, the models did not perform as well in LatAm when considering AUPRC. This finding may be related to differences in the timing of outcomes and the number of patients used in the model development. We found some consistencies in top predictors of mortality after COVID19 in LatAm and North America. In both regions, age and vintage were top predictors of death in all timeframes and the nutrition markers of albumin and creatinine were top predictors for every timeframe except 15-30 days after presentation. The top predictors of shorter-and intermediate-term mortality after COVID-19 appeared to include unique patient attributes (e.g. higher BMI and/or male sex) that were not top predictors for longer-term mortality. Despite the consistencies, there were several regional distinctions identified. Ultimately, the results showed patients who survived COVID-19 had a better clinical status historically and at presentation, which was clearly seen for markers of nutrition in all models at all follow up time points, and further included markers of anemia and mineral bone disorders. Achievement of quality targets

before and throughout the recovery process may be of high importance to survival in COVID-19. Furthermore, markers of higher inflammation appeared to remarkably contribute to the risk of death and may be important to consider when determining a patient's prognosis in COVID-19.
Our study is unique in that it used underexplored follow-up timeframes, included a wide variety of commonly reported variables in the world, assessed temporal patterns in clinical factors before COVID-19 presentation, and utilized machine learning techniques that can account for collinearity and missingness. Other efforts assessing the predictors of mortality in COVID-19 typically assessed outcomes about 30 to 90 days after presentation, and used traditional modeling techniques (e.g. regression methods) [25] that cannot handle a larger number of input variables and are prone to bias through confounding interactions [3, 4, 8]. These studies provided critical early insights to the nephrology community, yet further investigations with more follow up time

Mean SHAP values are shown for the top 15 predictors in each region, including the mutual and the exclusive top predictors in LatAm and North America. Mean SHAP values are show in descending order of importance in reference to the LatAm group

and more generalizable patient numbers are sparse. In our study, we observed marked differences in most clinical and demographic factors between the groups who died or survived, which made the selection of meaningful predictors for traditional modeling efforts complex. Initial investigations of correlations and collinearity in our datasets found unacceptable interactions between most variables, and this led us to select machine learning techniques that can account for these issues and limit bias.
Previous studies investigating the risk factors for mortality in dialysis patients with COVID-19 have consistently found older age categories are one of the most important risk factors for death considering follow up timeframes of 28 to 90 days [3, 4, 8, 26]. Our findings in two regional cohorts of adult HD patients further substantiate these observations. In contrast with prior studies that commonly found presence of heart failure or

ischemic heart disease to be a key predictor of mortality [3, 4, 27], we never found these to be in the top 15 predictors, in any model at any follow up period in either region. We presume this is reflective of the high importance of clinical variables (e.g. laboratories and vital signs) on the prediction of death after COVID-19, factors that were not included in other reports. The results of this study build upon insights from other studies in dialysis patients and ultimately provide unique results on clinical parameters, show important considerations in temporal associations, and used models that can avoid bias resulting from collinearity. Nonetheless, further analysis is needed to differentiate parameters that are attributable to risks in COVID-19, which would include comparing the predictors of mortality in patients with and without COVID-19.
Considering reports specifically from LatAm countries with longer follow up periods, a study of 741 HD patients

with COVID-19 in Brazil showed 18.8% of patients died within 90 days of diagnosis in 2020, and the majority of death events were found to have occurred within 15 days [26]. Using a stepwise regression model, this study found the significant predictors of 90-day mortality in COVID19 were diabetes and dialysis catheter use, in addition to increasing age in years [26]. We also observed diabetes was in the top 15 predictors of mortality any time, and during shorter- and longer-term follow up periods, after COVID-19 in LatAm. However, we only found catheter exposure was a risk factor for longer-term mortality, ultimately clarifying the that the risk factor is the most meaningful in the subset of patients who survive at least 30 days after COVID-19 in LatAm and may be specific to the region. Notably, we never found catheter exposure to be a top predictor of mortality after COVID-19 in the North America cohort. Given the Brazilian study

only evaluated a limited number of predictors and did not include any laboratories or HD treatment variables, it may have inadvertently elevated associations with catheter use to appear more meaningful than they truly are considering the majority of the routinely captured clinical information [26].
Looking at reports specifically from North America with longer follow up periods, an analysis of data from 60,090 prevalent dialysis patients with COVID-19 in the United States who had Medicare insurance found 26.0% of patients died throughout 2020 [27]. This study used a Cox regression model to determine the risk factors related to mortality after COVID-19 diagnosis, and found the significant predictors of death included older age, longer dialysis vintage, being male, higher BMI categories, being of a white race, presence of congestive heart failure or ischemic heart disease along with other

Mean SHAP values are shown for the top 15 predictors in each region, including the mutual and the exclusive top predictors in LatAm and North America. Mean SHAP values are show in descending order of importance in reference to the LatAm group

parameters (e.g. modality, population density, nursing home utilization). We showed consistent findings for increased risks of death in COVID-19 with older age and longer vintage for all follow up timepoints in our North America cohort. Further, we also found being male was a top predictor of mortality in COVID-19, especially for shorter- and intermediate-term outcomes. However, we did not observe male sex to be a top predictor of longerterm outcomes occurring>30 days after presentation. We also found higher BMI to be a top predictor, yet only for shorter-term mortality within 14 days of presentation. Although BMI was not a top predictor of longer-term death in North America, it is noteworthy to mention that the association became inversed with lower BMI being associated with a higher risk of death coming in as the ­34th predictor in the region. Remarkably, this observation was more clearly seen in the LatAm cohort where higher

BMI was among the top 15 predictors of shorter-term death and lower BMI was among the top 15 predictors of longer-term death after COVID-19 (Fig. 6). As mentioned earlier, we did not find heart failure or ischemic heart disease to be top predictors. We did not include race in our models since we focused on variables that are universally captured in both world regions; data on race is not captured in some LatAm countries, which is a limitation.
Traditional regression modelling techniques can provide a simpler interpretation on a population level due to the requirement for establishing a reference, with categories or successive changes in the measure, of which the former considers everyone in a group to be the same and the latter requires the assumption of linear relationships in effects [25]. This process allows a hazard ratio or odds ratio to be produced and provides an average probability

Guinsburg et al. BMC Nephrology (2022) 23:340

Page 21 of 23

of an outcome in one group or another, or by a specified increase/decrease. Although traditional techniques can provide a simple interpretation for a population, information gain is often lost, and unacceptable generalization can occur. Non-linear modeling, such as the machine learning techniques we utilized, can consider the effects for continuous variables without categorization and do not require arbitrary assumptions in linear relationships [25]. It is worthwhile to mention there have been advancements in predictive modeling techniques in recent years, and deep learning methods might have the potential to perform even better than the machine learning methods chosen by us due to the XGBoost model's ability to account for collinearity and missingness [28, 29]. A limitation of these machine and deep learning models are that the outputs can be less intuitive on a population level. In our case, we report the SHAP values in log odds (i.e. the logarithm of the odds ratio) with average population risks being provided in absolute values that only show relative importance of a factor, yet not the direction of the association. Nonetheless, the individual predictions can provide more interpretable information for any given individual patient, in a more personalized manner, including each individual patient's probability of experiencing an outcome, as well as the probability and direction of the association for each individual predictor variable for each individual patient. Importantly, the top predictors established consider the average risk for patients in each regional cohort and the top predictors for individuals will likely differ some since every affected patient may not have the same physiological disturbances in the same factors.
Although we observed consistencies in the top predictors of mortality in COVID-19 in HD patients between the world regions, we did find some contrasts in the top predictors as well as inverse associations. These could be in part reflective of the differences in the timing of death events after COVID, which occurred earlier in LatAm and later in North America. Supporting this, we did find some the top predictors of mortality changed from shorter to longer survival times, such as in the case of BMI. Also, these contrasts could be attributable to differences in the regional cohorts related to patient characteristics, practice patterns, and resource limitations. Some select laboratories were measured less frequently in Latin versus North America countries, which is a potential limitation. However, we did not qualitatively observe any concerning differences in the descriptive statistics for the cohorts.
Our findings highlight how machine learning techniques can provide personalized insights for individual patients to understand the specific risk factors of death in COVID-19 for each patient, as well as provide

a better generalization of the most important risk factors for a cohort/population. We found most the models constructed had suitable performance in providing individualized prognosis for HD patients with COVID19. These modeling techniques can be adopted by providers with analytical resources to assist care teams and enhance treatment paradigms. We recommend using an array of variables and including modifiable factors to provide potential ways to intervene. In the development of models, fewer variables could be considered, and data driven selection of variables is recommended. If models are adapted considering fewer variables (e.g. the top 15, 25, or 50), they would likely perform acceptably with the most information gain being attributable to the top predictors, yet a reasonable proportion of the top predictors should be included to maintain the ability to provide personalized predictions, especially for modifiable factors that can be intervened upon. Notably, we used a default cutoff threshold for calculation the balanced accuracy performance metric. It may be prudent to evaluate adjustments in this cutoff threshold for prospective efforts to optimize model performance for a specific use case and intervention.
Prior efforts have leveraged machine learning modeling to assist with early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HD patients [30], and these models add another set of resources to be considered in the clinician's toolbox by providing a method to suitably assist with the prognosis of HD patients who contract COVID-19. Amidst the time of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines being more and more of an option in the world, the predictors of mortality will need to be established specifically in vaccinated dialysis patients considering regional differences in the world in patient populations and vaccine types. Given some countries continue to have limitations in access to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [12], these models and the established predictors of mortality in HD patients before vaccines were available will be of high importance to the global nephrology community and can be leveraged for the development of models in vaccinated cohorts.
Conclusions In summary, our findings show the profiles of mortality in HD patients with COVID-19 were distinct in LatAm and North America throughout the year 2020. There was a higher mortality rate within 0-14 or 15-30 days after COVID-19 in LatAm, while the mortality rate was higher in North America>30 days after presentation. Irrespective of these differences, a marked proportion of HD patients died>30 days after presentation with COVID-19 (6% in LatAm and 9% in North America

cohorts). We were able to successfully construct a series of prediction models with suitable performance in both regions for determining the risk of death in an HD patient any time after COVID-19 presentation, as well as within 0-14, 15-30, and>30 days after COVID-19 presentation. Results showed older age, longer vintage, poor nutrition, and higher inflammation were consistently top predictors of death in COVID-19 in both world regions at all timepoints after COVID-19 presentation. Unique patient attributes including higher BMI and male sex were top predictors of shorter-and intermediate-term mortality, yet not longer-term mortality. These insights further expand our understanding of the profiles and predictors of mortality and provide modeling techniques that can be considered for use by dialysis providers internationally.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been applied successfully in many real-life domains for solving complex problems. With the invention of Machine Learning (ML) paradigms, it becomes convenient for researchers to predict the outcome based on past data. Nowadays, ML is acting as the biggest weapon against the COVID-19 pandemic by detecting symptomatic cases at an early stage and warning people about its futuristic effects. It is observed that COVID-19 has blown out globally so much in a short period because of the shortage of testing facilities and delays in test reports. To address this challenge, AI can be effectively applied to produce fast as well as cost-effective solutions. Plenty of researchers come up with AI-based solutions for preliminary diagnosis using chest CT Images, respiratory sound analysis, voice analysis of symptomatic persons with asymptomatic ones, and so forth. Some AI-based applications claim good accuracy in predicting the chances of being COVID-19-positive. Within a short period, plenty of research work is published regarding the identification of COVID-19. is paper has carefully examined and presented a comprehensive survey of more than 110 papers that came from various reputed sources, that is, Springer, IEEE, Elsevier, MDPI, arXiv, and medRxiv. Most of the papers selected for this survey presented candid work to detect and classify COVID-19, using deep-learning-based models from chest X-Rays and CT scan images. We hope that this survey covers most of the work and provides insights to the research community in proposing efficient as well as accurate solutions for fighting the pandemic.

1. Introduction
World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 (COrona VIrus Disease-2019) on February 11, 2020, as the name of a new disease which is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Coronavirus is among the large family of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) that causes diseases from cold infections. It is one of the newest viruses that were not discovered previously in humans. Typical signs of infection include cough, sore throat, fever,

fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and breath shortness. COVID-19 pandemic is attributable to its property of respiratory transmission from one person to another, which causes the rapid spread of the disease. Wuhan in China reported the first case of COVID-19 in December 2019. WHO announced the coronavirus outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, because it has affected the whole globe physically, socially, economically, and in many other areas. Its impact forces most of the affected countries to announce and implement a complete lockdown in the country. Since the first case in

2

December 2019, the total number of infected people has reached more than 568 million as of Jul 20, 2022, including 6 million deaths. ere are two main reasons for these numbers, namely, fast-spreading nature of 2019-nCov and late arrival of symptoms after getting infected. People come to know after 10-14 days that they have been infected with this virus. As a result, during this period, thousands of people get infected from that affected person. e deficiency of facilities, namely, rapid identification of disease, laboratory facilities, isolation facilities, doctors, other staff, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits, and medicines, increases the risk of viral transmission. In general, we can say that the spreading rate of 2019nCov is exponential. Jiang et al. [1] have also modeled the shape of such epidemics to be exponential. e total infected cases of countries are getting double in just a few days because the characteristics of 2019-nCov are not fully recognized yet. It is hard to discover the positive cases at an early stage. at is why it is of utmost importance to detect COVID-19 at an early stage to prevent its spreading. Governments are continuously issuing precautionary guidelines to the citizens for seeking cooperation in this regard. ey used to advise citizens to follow social distancing and suspended industrial/school/office activities. It is the only way by which one can stay safer from getting infected. e situation of such a mysterious virus seems to be out of control as of now.
Many researchers are trying to devise mechanisms to investigate faster, reliable, and accurate detection of the disease. In general, we can classify all these techniques into two categories, namely, clinical examinations in the laboratory and other mechanisms (applying computational intelligence techniques, i.e., AI, ML, DL, and statistics). e goal of all these techniques has a single destiny, that is, to screen COVID-19 at an early stage. From the beginning, the validity of disease detection mainly depends on the earlier one, that is, clinical examinations. One of the famous techniques of this kind is Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). As compared to RT-PCR, computer-based detection can also help pathologists in a significant way because RT-PCR is a time-consuming investigation. It is sure that AI will not stop this pandemic but it can track and respond to the global emergency.
e performance of these techniques heavily depends on the availability of data. ey perform better when the size of data is relatively large. Here the authors have focused more on AI-enabled technologies for predicting or handling the disease outbreaks. Many researchers have claimed to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. However, the size of their datasets is not so large as it needs to be. erefore, this study aims to present a comprehensive survey of work done by several researchers in diagnosing COVID-19 from chest radiographic images, that is, CTsamples and X-ray images. e papers reviewed in this study are obtained from reputed sources, for example, ScienceDirect, Springer, MDPI, e Lancet, medRxiv, and arXiv preprints. Only specific studies related to deep learning models for early diagnosis of COVID-19 from radiographic images have been considered after applying several filters. e main contributions of this survey are highlighted as follows:

(1) Comprehensive discussion of some AI-based solutions (mobile Apps, CT software, knowledge-based systems, etc.) for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.
(2) In-depth review as well as the illustration of architectures of several deep-learning-based approaches (convolutional neural networks) for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest CT scans and X-ray images.
(3) Comparative study of classification accuracies of several deep learning models in classifying COVID19 from other types of pneumonia from CT scans and X-ray images.
(4) Brief discussion of several computational approaches for analyzing and predicting the COVID-19 pandemic trends.
(5) Presenting several imaging datasets for encouraging COVID-19 research.
(6) Highlighting the pros and cons of deep-learningbased approaches for COVID-19 along with pointing out several open research issues.
e rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the importance of Artificial Intelligence in COVID-19 by presenting a few AI-based solutions that can play a vital role in coping with the COVID-19 outbreak. Deep-learning-based approaches for the identification of COVID-19 from the chest CT scan and X-ray images are briefed in Section 3 and Section 4, respectively. Section 5 highlights some contributions of computational approaches other than deep learning for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. Some COVID-19 public imaging datasets for performing the deep-learning-based research are presented in Section 6. A brief discussion of the pros and cons of using deep learning in solving real-life problems is presented in Section 7. Finally, Section 8 concludes the study with future directions.
2. AI-Enabled Solutions for COVID-19
AI-based automated disease detections are becoming more popular nowadays. ere are several advantages of detecting COVID-19 using AI-based techniques, namely, faster detection, fewer chances of being affected while collecting and testing samples, cost-effectiveness, portability, and no worries about the availability of testing kits. During the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, only a few repositories with limited COVID-19 patients' images were available. However, nowadays, there are many accessible progressive repositories to help the research community deploy and test their deep-learning-based models. Some sample X-ray and CT scan images of COVID-19-affected lungs are shown in Figures 1(a) and 1(b), respectively.
However, it is challenging to detect novel Coronavirus (nCov) infections at an early stage with the help of X-ray and CT scan images using deep learning. However, at a later stage, the task of radiologists in screening COVID-19 patients can be eased. Deep learning as an emerging concept is gaining popularity in the field of medical imaging. Before

discussing more details about the deep learning paradigm, let us find out the relationship between neural network (NN), deep learning (DL), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) as shown in Figure 2.
Mei et al. [4] presented an AI-based solution for minimizing the RT-PCR method's time. ey have integrated chest CT finding with several other factors, namely, symptoms and laboratory testing for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19. e system was claimed to be a more powerful tool for radiologists if CT images and clinical history were available. e reason behind the integration of other parameters with CT findings is to provide higher accuracy because CT findings alone are not enough to predict the infection. In some cases, early CT findings can be standard for an infected person, so, to minimize the risk of spreading the disease, it is foremost required to integrate some other parameters to have a clear idea.
e authors first developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to learn the characteristics of CT images. e process is put into action by the classification of COVID-19 patients using three different classification techniques, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Random Forest. e performance of MLP was better than those of the other techniques under consideration.

Fong et al. [5] developed a model using Composite Monte Carlo (CMC) for making decisions under the high uncertainty of 2019-nCov. We know that, in the pandemic of COVID-19, every Government is supposed to make crucial decisions to save its citizens' essential lives, but, due to the uncertain behavior of 2019-nCov, it seems a challenging task. CMC can forecast by combining data from small data sources, followed by drawing probability distributions. e authors have significantly used this property of CMC, followed by enhancements using DL and fuzzy rule induction. MC is suitable to model epidemics such as COVID-19 because their data are generally changing over time. MC provides output in terms of probability distributions of expected outcomes. e work of Fong et al. [5] is based on the Group of Optimized and Multisource Selection (GROOMS), which is applied to select a Machine Learning model based on accuracy. ey have analyzed the data collected from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention1(CCDC). eir parameters of interest were only a few, namely, the number of people affected by and cured of COVID-19. However, these parameters' values depend on various other parameters, namely, social factors and psychological factors. e method was followed by fuzzy rule induction (FRI), which further investigates the logic behind the epidemic. eir goal was to estimate the cost needed for

employed to train their powerful system for sending noti-

ML fications to their customers.

technologies like AI, NLP, and Big Data to make predictions

several sources, analyzing them using advanced analytical

tools, and making predictions about outbreaks. It also

controlling and planning during these epidemics. Experimental results have shown that the novel methodology can forecast the direct cost requirements for dealing with COVID-19 epidemics. On the other hand, Peng and Nagata [6] analyzed the trend of COVID-19 pandemic data of the twelve most affected countries for predicting the number of COVID-19 cases using Machine-Learning-based approaches. ey have emphasized the need for utmost caution while applying Machine Learning models in decision making, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, Mehta and Shukla [7] presented a pandemic analysis using AI and big data analytics.
2.1. Some AI-Enabled Tools for Coping with a COVID-19 Outbreak. AI-enabled tools are getting popular in the healthcare domain due to their tremendous applications. Many companies are running their businesses in the healthcare sector by providing solutions to common problems using AI. Current applications of AI, namely, radiology and diagnosis, are so specific that they may not be suitable to predict a global pandemic like COVID-19. However, few companies like BlueDot [8] and Metabiota [9] claimed that their AI-enabled solutions can identify, quantify, and mitigate the risks due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

2.1.3. Chatbots. Chatbots can also play a critical role in screening patients before sample collection. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, pathological laboratories (identified as COVID-19 test/sample collection center) face a huge crowd. To minimize this crowd, these labs are filtering patients by first putting them under NLP-enabled chatbot to answer a few essential queries; and one can decide the severity or urgency of being tested. eir chatbots are so powerful in analyzing the responses of patients in real time and suggesting the preliminary diagnosis. Patients on their own can take advantage of these chatbots at their home before proceeding to hospitals/laboratories.
2.1.4. Qure.ai. Qure.ai [11], a US-based company, is offering several solutions in the field of healthcare. To cope with the pandemic of COVID-19 using AI, they have devised two special tools, namely, "qXR" and "qScout-EMR." "qXR" tool is meant for COVID-19 progression monitoring. is automated tool monitors the progression of infected patients daily. It automatically estimates the affected lung area and tracks changes. "qScout-EMR," on the other hand, is providing a pandemic response care platform. All registrations of infected persons are done using this tool and are accessible via any mobile or laptop. e registration step adds all linked contacts that can be at risk. It monitors their health by daily symptom checking and sending intimations to all concerned automatically.

2.1.1. BlueDot. e AI-enabled tool of BlueDot [8] can perform predictions on outbreaks of infectious diseases. It collects data from numerous sources using AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities. As per its website, BlueDot was the first to intimate its client about COVID-19 risk via their "insights" platform. Its Big Data processing capabilities collect data from more than 10,000 sources over 60 languages every day [10]. Primary sources include air travel data, population density, national statistics reports, World Factbook, global infectious disease alert, climate data, and animals' disease reservoirs. After collecting data from

2.1.5. AlphaFold. DeepMind [12], founded in 2010 and further acquired by Google in 2014, is a famous AI-enabled company working for advancing the state of the art. DeepMind's "AlphaFold" is an AI-enabled protein structure prediction system, shown in Figure 3. e core of AlphaFold is its CNN model trained with genomic data extracted from Protein Data Bank (PDB). It works by finding out the distributions among several pairs of residues in a protein because disease predictions rely heavily on protein structure.
e distribution calculation is antecedent to the estimation of the proposed structure.

2.1.6. RADLogics. RADLogics [13] has presented its AIbased CT image analysis tools for accurate and automatic identification of COVID-19. eir AI-based analysis also suggests a corona score for measuring a patient's progression and recovery time. Another AI-based solution called "Virtual Resident" can analyze X-ray, CT scan, MRI, and ultrasound scans. Some researchers [13] also deployed a deep-learning-based model for COVID-19 classification from CT scan images using pretrained AI systems of RADLogics as their subsystem.
2.1.7. Aarogya Setu. To help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in India, the Government of India (GOI) launched the Aarogya Setu mobile app [14] on April 02, 2020. Aarogya Setu app provides many facilities based on Bluetooth and GPS, such as contact tracing of COVID-19 patients, hotspot mapping, and providing other important information relevant to COVID-19. Over 215 million users were taking benefits from this app as of April 05, 2022. After installation, the user must complete a self-assessment test by answering some simple questions on symptoms of cough, fever, difficulty in breathing, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, travel history, interaction with any COVID-19 patient, and so forth. Based on users' answers, this app collects location-related data via Bluetooth and GPS so that the Government can track the patient and notify other users within that region. Along with COVID-19 tracking, the app provides several other facilities to the citizens, that is, e-pass (permission for traveling to other states and districts during lockdown period) generation, COVID-19 updates, COVID19 helpline, useful resources, list of laboratories approved by GOI for COVID-19 testing, essential links for donations to PM care fund, and notifications related to COVID-19 patients within the radius of 500 m to 10 km. e app is available to be used in twelve languages of India, and its code was also released to be open source by GOI on May 26, 2020.
2.1.8. AI4COVID-19. Imran et al. [15] developed an AIengine-based app to distinguish between a regular cough and a COVID-19 cough by analyzing cough samples. Cough is a common symptom of suffering from cold, and that is why cough alone cannot be the key-decisive parameter to

identify that a person is suffering from COVID, but it can help patients perform initial screening on their own in just a few moments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, such apps present themselves as the best usage of technologies.
As per the availability of progressive cough data, the accuracy of this app may improve. e app is also not clinically approved but is based on features of distinct respiratory syndromes of cough. e app works by collecting cough samples that are input for the pretrained AI engine to recognize the type of cough based on features. e overall architecture of AI4COVID-19 is depicted in Figure 4. Initially recorded cough samples are converted to Mel-spectrogram using Cepstral analysis. e result of this phase is the input images for the CNN model for cough detection. Experimental detail shows 90% accuracy of the AI4COVID19 app for the identification of COVID and non-COVID cough. Several other applications which are applied by many countries for tracing COVID-19 are summarized by Lalmuanawma et al. [16].
3. Deep-Learning-Based Identification of COVID-19 and Pneumonia from CT Scan Images
Detecting COVID-19 from images alone is a challenging task. Due to the sudden outbreak of COVID-19, radiologists and hospitals are feeling overburdened. is type of burden on the healthcare sector is correlated directly with COVID19 mortalities [17]. On the other hand, deep learning methodologies are trying to reduce this burden by screening COVID-19 patients at an early stage. In a short period, plenty of researchers have developed CNN models for faster and reliable patients' screening to minimize the time required for disease identification. CT scan analysis is one of the predominant investigations for the screening of COVID19 patients. e importance of CT scan images is observed easily from several clinical case study reports. Lin et al. [18] discussed the importance of CT scan images in identifying asymptomatic patients of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP). e reported patients were asymptomatic with no preexisting diseases. However, multiple ground-glass opacities (GGO) were located with the help of High-Resolution CT (HRCT). One of the patients was 61 years old, and that patient remained without any complications and had no symptoms, namely, fever, fatigue, cough, myalgias, headache, tiredness, sputum production, hemoptysis, or diarrhea. e patient also had no history of smoking and no history of other diseases, namely, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. e patient was treated with oral antiviral drugs only. Fortunately, after the 23rd day of admission, the patient's bilateral pulmonary lesions and pleural effusions got resolved.
DL-based implementation is used for preparing detailed clinical reports of patients as well. In this regard, Cao et al. [19] presented detailed illustrations of two COVID-19 positive patients using voxel-level DL-based segmentation of CT scan images based on U-Net [20]. Keeping in mind the importance of CT scan images, this section highlights some

of the works that focused on identifying COVID-19 and pneumonia from chest CT scan images using deep-learningbased paradigms. Although CNNs provide several metrics by which one can analyze their performances, the work discussed in this paper is mainly focused on analyzing classification metrics. One of the prime metrics to measure the classification performance is the confusion matrix, shown in Figure 5.
e confusion matrix summarizes correct versus incorrect predictions of a classification model, where predicted observations are matched with the actual ones. TP, FP, FN, and TN are explained as follows:
(i) True Positive (TP): positive prediction of positive observation.
(ii) False Positive (FP): positive prediction of negative observation.
(iii) False Negative (FN): negative prediction of positive observation.
(iv) True Negative (TN): negative prediction of negative observation.
ese metrics are further utilized to provide the classification performance in terms of precision, specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and so forth described as given in the five following equations:
precision  TP , (1) (TP + FP)
Sensitivity  TN , (2) (TN + FP)
Specificity or Recall  TP , (3) (TP + FN)
Accuracy  (TP + TN) , (4) (TP + TN + FP + FN)

In this paper, the authors presented a comparison based on classification accuracy of several deep learning models for classifying CTscan as well as X-ray images to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 images.
Wang et al. [21] deployed an AI-based system that is capable of automatically detecting COVID-19 from CT scan images. eir system has achieved a sensitivity of 0.98 and is installed in 16 hospitals, screening 1300 cases per day. e system is doing two main intended tasks, namely, reducing healthcare burden during screening and fulfilling the lack of experienced radiologists. Based on their earlier developed deep learning models, they have selected the best model for this task. e data of COVID-19 patients were taken from 5 hospitals in Wuhan and Beijing. After collecting relevant data, annotations for lesions (if any) were processed, followed by several preprocessing techniques (normalization, window width, window width adjustments, lung segmentation, etc.).
e deep learning architecture of their system is mainly divided into two models, namely, segmentation and classification. e segmentation model is used for obtaining lung regions, and the classification model determines COVID-19 positivity in these regions. For both segmentation and classification models, they have selected the best models out of their previously developed models. e combined 3D U-Net++ [22] (segmentation model) and ResNet50 [23] (classification model) achieved best area under the curve (AUC) of 0.991.
Zheng et al. [24] developed a novel CNN model called DeCoVNet for detecting COVID-19 from chest CT images.
e model first segments the CT images using a pretrained U-Net [20], and then these segmented images are fed into the DL model for COVID-19 prediction. Along with segmented images, they have considered several other factors, namely, clinical signs, travel and disease history, and laboratory examinations. e ground truth label was applied as per the decision made by expert radiologists. e input to DeCoVNet is CT volume and its corresponding lung mask (generated by U-Net [20]). 3D lung mask contributes toward reducing background information to achieve higher accuracy. Original CT volume is combined with the 3D lung mass volume to make a final volume followed by resampling into a 224 × 336 resolution. Due to limited data availability, data augmentation has been applied. ese resampled images serve as input for training the network. DeCoVNet consists of three main parts, namely, network stem, 3D residual blocks (ResBlocks), and a progressive classifier (ProClf ). e network stem consists of 3D convolution using a kernel of a 5 × 7 × 7 size and batch norm and pooling layers. Meanwhile, in the second step, from each ResBlock, a 3D feature map is being passed into 3D convolution. Finally, ProClf performs

Contrast Media & Molecular Imaging

the classification of images using three 3D convolution layers and a fully connected layer with a softmax activation function. e overall pipeline of DeCoVNet is shown in Figure 6. For validating the experimental study, images of 630 CTscans were considered. Out of 630 CTscans, 499 were used for training and the rest for testing. e results of the experimental study are promising, which in turn may contribute to the healthcare sector.
Song et al. [25] proposed a deep learning model for the identification of COVID-19 from chest CT scan images.
ey first collected CT scan images of 88 COVID-19 patients, followed by preprocessing filling blank regions in the lung images. Top-k detail from CT scan images was extracted using Details Relation Extraction Neural Network (DRENet) and then final prediction was performed using aggregation. However, the model was able to achieve the classification accuracy of only 86%.
Zhang et al. [26] constructed a novel deep-learningbased model for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 from an extensive CT image database of 3,777 patients. e overall work is comprised of two main models, namely, lung segmentation and analysis. In lung-lesion segmentation, the lung lesions are segmented from the background using DeepLabv3 to create a lung-lesion map. e lung-lesion map is further utilized for the classification of CT segments and achieved an overall classification accuracy of 92.49%.
Pretrained models are playing a pivotal role in deploying models for COVID-19 identification. Kini et al. [27] employed the concept of transfer learning by proposing an ensemble deep learning model and achieved an overall accuracy of 98.98%. Li et al. [28] developed a deep learning model called COVNet (based on ResNet50 [23]) for detecting COVID-19 by extracting features from 4356 3D chest CT examinations (collected from 6 hospitals). Out of these images, 30% were of COVID-19-positive patients (confirmation by RT-PCR), 40% of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and the rest 30% of nonpneumonia. ey have used the 3D CT scan slices as input for training the model and developed a feature map from features extracted from these slices. e feature extraction phase is then followed by a maxpooling operation for combining features of these slices. Finally, a fully connected layer generates a feature map followed by the generation of probability score by a softmax activation function. eir model was able to present the specificity of 96% and AUC of 0.96 for COVID-19 identification.
Ardakani et al. [29] presented a study of ten CNN models for classification of COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia from CT scan images. Out of ten well-known CNN models, the performances of ResNet-101 [23] and Xception [30] were found to be better compared to the others. ResNet101 achieved 99.51% accuracy, whereas Xception achieved 99.02% in classifying COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases. ey have also analyzed radiologists' performance for the same purpose and reported moderate performance with a classification accuracy of 83.33%. It is evident that not only are computational models, especially deep learning models, able to save a significant amount of time in reading the radiographical images but also they provide accurate results.

[31] presented an automated deep learning model (based on ResNet18) for COVID-19 classification from 3D CT scan images. e experimental evaluation was done on 618 CT samples, out of which 219 images were of 110 COVID-19 patients, 224 of influenza patients, and 175 of healthy personnel. ese 3D CT images were then segmented for identification of required region of interest. Feature extraction was done from segmented images using ResNet18, followed by pooling operation for dimension reduction and to prevent overfitting. e output is then converted to a feature vector followed by a fully connected layer that provides the final classification of images into three classes: COVID-19, influenza, and healthy. e model was able to achieve an overall classification accuracy of 86.7% only.
Chen et al. [32] presented a deep learning model (based on U-Net++ [22]) for COVID-19 classification from HighResolution CT (HRCT) scan images. A dataset of 46096 CT images of 106 patients was used for evaluating the performance of the model. ree experienced radiologists did the labeling on infected regions. e model has achieved the perpatient classification accuracy of 95.24% and per-image classification accuracy of 98.85%. However, some inconsistencies were observed between the evaluations performed by a radiologist and their model.
Shan et al. [33] developed a 3D convolutional neural network called VB-Net (based on V-Net [34]) for COVID19 classification from CT scan images. As compared to V-Net, VB-Net has shown more efficiency. VB-Net consists of two phases, namely, downsampling and feature extraction and upsampling and feature integration. A total of 549 CT images were considered for the study, out of which 300 were used for testing and 259 for training. Testing and training contained a significant number of lung infections and they were collected from different CT scan centers. Based on segmentation results by VB-Net, the study follows a statistical analysis of the percentage of infection (POI) in lung and bronchopulmonary segments. Comparative analysis between automatic segmentation and manual segmentation yields a mean POI estimation error of 0.3%.
Huang et al. [35] presented a deep learning model (based on U-Net [20]) for the classification of chest CT scan images. Generally, deep learning models only prove the necessary information about whether a patient is affected by a disease. However, their model classified CT images into four categories (i.e., mild, moderate, severe, and critical) with the help of evaluation performed by both automatic segmentation and radiologists. A chest CT scan of 842 COVID-19 confirmed patients was considered in the experimental

evaluation. For feature extraction, U-Net [20] uses downsampling for reducing the 512 × 512 image to a 16 × 16 × 256 feature map and upsampling to 512 × 512 × 2 for lesion localization.
Wang et al. [36] presented a deep learning algorithm by fine-tuning the pretrained Inception model to classify chest CT images. ey have used 1,065 images for the experimental study, out of which 325 images were of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 patients. eir algorithm consists of three main components, namely, image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Overall, network architecture can be viewed as a two-phase network model, where the first phase is responsible for generating a one-dimensional feature vector, and later a fully connected network performs the final classification. e overall classification accuracy (89.5%) of their model is further compared with the predictions made by two skilled radiologists. e performance of thier model was found to be better than the performance of radiologists. Pan and Guan [38] also summarized some expected changes in the patients using CT scan images. CT manifestations can represent several features (lung GGOs, pulmonary consolidation, nodules, etc.) that can help detect 2019-nCov. Pathak et al. [37] presented a deep-transfer-learning-based model using ResNet50 [23] for detecting COVID-19 cased from CT images. eir model was able to achieve a test accuracy of 93% only. Meanwhile Wu et al. [39] presented a deeplearning-based multiview fusion model capable of analyzing age-based subgroups of COVID-19 cases from CT images.
e summary of several deep-learning-based models used for diagnosis of COVID-19 from CT scan images is presented in Table 1 along with their classification accuracies. However, the datasets used in these works may not be the same.
4. Deep-Learning-Based Identification of COVID-19 and Pneumonia from X-Ray Images
Chest X-ray images also have the capabilities to show the symptoms of lung infections. However, as compared to CT images, X-ray images are less sensitive [40]. In most cases, the chest X-rays are reported to be normal during the disease's initial stages [41]. At later stages, some abnormalities in terms of diffuse and peripheral lung involvements have been observed. Nowadays, plenty of research is considering X-ray images to determine whether a person is suffering from COVID-19 or not. In this section, the authors tried to cover some of the works related to COVID-19 and pneumonia identification from chest X-ray images using deep-learning-based paradigms.
Aftab et al. [42] proposed an LSTM-based model to classify chest X-ray images into three classes, namely, normal, influenza, and COVID-19. With the incorporation of LSTM, their model was able to achieve 98% accuracy. Another LSTM-based model to detect COVID-19 from hybrid images was proposed by Irfan et al. [43]. eir hybrid deep neural network (HDNN) was equipped with a CNN for automated feature extraction and an LSTM for dealing with

vanishing gradients. e HDNN was able to provide 99% classification accuracy on hybrid images. Almalki et al. [44] presented a novel deep-learning-based method called CoVIRNet (COVID Inception-ResNet model) for COVID19 identification from X-ray images. e proposed model was able to achieve a classification accuracy of 97.29% using the Random Forest classifier. Zhang et al. [45] developed a new reliable deep learning model for fast screening of COVID-19 patients. e model works by detecting anomalies from chest X-ray images with 96% accuracy for symptomatic patients and 70.65% for asymptomatic persons. eir model consists of three main phases, namely, backbone network, classification, and anomaly detection.
e purpose of the backbone network is to extract useful features from X-ray images. ese features act as inputs for classification and anomaly detection. e results presented by them are promising, with a limitation of a 30% false positive rate. Deep learning has many applications in the healthcare sector. Panwar et al. [46] also presented a deeplearning-based model called nCOVnet for detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images. eir model is based on the concept of transfer learning where they have used top layers of VGG16 [47] and later customized with other layers. Experimental analysis on 337 X-ray images (192 COVID-19positive images) presented a classification accuracy of 97.62%.
Stephen et al. [48] have also presented an efficient approach for pneumonia classification using deep learning. eir dataset contains 5,856 anterior-posterior chest X-ray images of pneumonia patients aged 1 to 5 years. To make the dataset adequate and reduce the chances of overfitting, several augmentation techniques were employed. eir model contains two main parts, namely, feature extractor and classifier. Feature extractor contains four convolution layers (conv3 × 3, 32; conv3 × 3, 64; conv3 × 3, 128; and conv3 × 3, 128), max-pooling layer of a 2 × 2 size, and ReLU activation function. For classification, the dense layer uses the 1D feature vector as provided by the flattening process. Experimental results showed that their model could classify pneumonia and nonpneumonia images with a training accuracy of 0.95 and validation accuracy of 0.93. Wang and Wong [49] developed a novel deep learning model called COVID-Net for the detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. ey have classified chest X-ray images into four classes, namely, normal, bacterial infection, non-COVID viral infection, and COVID infection. e architecture design is mainly based on the projection-expansion-projection pattern. Despite adequate dataset consisting of 5941 chest images of 2839 patients collected from two growing public datasets, they achieved only 83.5% test accuracy.
DeTraC, a new method for detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images, has been presented by Abbas et al. [50]. DeTraC uses a threefold approach consisting of pretrained CNN models for feature extraction followed by class decomposition, training using gradient descent optimization, and classification. Experimental results on X-ray images showed a classification accuracy of 93.1% using VGG19 [47].

Zebin and Rezvy [51] used several pretrained CNNs for extracting features from chest X-ray (CXR) images and achieved 96.8% accuracy using EfficientNetB0 for COVID19 classification. Apostolopoulos et al. [52] also presented the classification of COVID-19 disease using state-of-the-art MobileNetV2 [53] on 3905 CXR images. Training the CNN from scratch can also lead to higher accuracy as depicted in their experimental results for classification of COVID and non-COVID cases. Along with COVID, their dataset consists of images of five other diseases and normal CXR images. Concerning the 2-class classification problem, their model gained an overall accuracy of 99.18% compared to 7-class accuracy of 87.66%.
Instead of developing deep learning models from scratch, pretrained models are also gaining popularity. In this regard, Togaçar et al. [54] presented a model based on MobileNetV2 [53] and SqueezeNet [55] followed by SVMbased classification for classifying COVID-19-affected chest X-ray images from normal and pneumonia images.
e deep learning model MobileNet is designed to perform object detection and classification for low hardware devices. MobileNet uses the ReLU activation function for providing nonlinear outputs. SqueezeNet [55], on the other hand, provides faster results by reducing the number of parameters, which leads to a reduction in overall model size. It contains a cascade of convolution, pooling, and fire layers.
ey have applied the concept of image reconstruction using the fuzzy color technique to remove noise. e images produced by the fuzzy color technique are further mixed with original images for the creation of a new dataset. 1000 features were generated with both MobileNet and SqueezeNet on the new dataset, followed by efficient features using Social Mimic Optimization (SMO). e overall pipeline of their work is depicted in Figure 7.
Experimental analysis on the 70 : 30 ratio of training and testing dataset claimed 99.27% accuracy using both models. Ozturk et al. [56] proposed a deep learning model based on the YOLO pretrained model called DarkCovidNet to automatically identify COVID-19 cases from X-ray images with an accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes (COVID and non-COVID). However, one of the essential requirements for a deep learning model (large dataset) is still missing. ey

have used a database consisting of 127 X-ray images of COVID-19-positive patients . Also, most of the patients' age information is unknown, and the age was approximated to be 55 in their experimental evaluation. However, 1000 images from another dataset named ChestX-ray8 are also considered in the study, but they all do not belong to COVID-19 patients. eir model contains 17 convolutional layers, followed by BatchNorm and LeakyReLU operations. For updating weights, the Adam optimizer is being used along with the cross-entropy loss function. eir experimental results are based on an 80 : 20 ratio of training versus testing data using 5-fold cross-validation and 100 epochs. After classifying images into COVID-19 and no findings, they have used HeatMap to identify the lesions, and the same was presented before expert radiologists for final verification, as shown in Figure 8. is final step provides strength to validate the proposed model.
Ghosal and Tucker [57] presented a Bayesian deep learning classifier that uses pretrained ResNet50V2 to classify COVID-19 images from 5941 chest X-ray images.
eir objective was to help radiologists estimate the uncertainty of deep learning models for reliable prediction of diseases. Especially for a beginner radiologist, deep learning models can contribute to increasing overall prediction accuracy.
On the other hand, Narin et al. [58] presented a deep learning model for the identification of COVID-19 using three existing deep learning models, namely, ResNet50 [23], InceptionV3 [59], and InceptionResNetV2 [60], from X-ray images as shown in Figure 9.
eir models need no separate feature extraction; instead, they use the transfer learning capabilities that provide adequate accuracy even in fewer data. eir experimental analysis depicted higher classification accuracy of 98% using ResNet50 [23] compared to 97% and 87% accuracy using InceptionV3 and InceptionResNetV2, respectively.
Sethy et al. [61] also presented a framework for the identification of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. eir model extracted features from thirteen existing CNN models followed by SVM classification. e classification problem presented here is a three-class problem intended to classify chest X-ray images into three classes, namely, healthy,

pneumonia, and COVID. A total of 381 X-ray images (127 of each category) have been considered in the experimental study. RestNet50 [23] model was able to present maximum classification accuracy as compared to other models under consideration.
Hemdan et al. [62] presented a framework that takes advantage of the existing seven deep learning models, namely, VGG19, DenseNet201 [63], MobileNetV2, Xception, ResNetV2, InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3. ey have considered chest X-ray images of 50 patients only, out of which 25 patients were COVID-19-positive. Experimental results show higher accuracy of 90% in the cases of VGG19 and DenseNet201.
Khan et al. [64] also presented a deep learning model called CoroNet based on a pretrained Xception model for the classification of chest X-ray images. Xception is pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and consists of 71 deep layers connected in a residual manner, which avoids vanishing

gradients. eir work is classified into three main scenarios, namely, four-class, three-class, and two-class classification.
eir experimental analysis on public datasets [2] revealed an overall classification accuracy of 89.6%.
Rahimzadeh and Attar [65] trained various CNN models and presented a concatenated network using Xception and ResNet50V2 for classifying X-ray images into three classes, namely, COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal. Xception contains several inception layers which are formed from depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution operation. ResNet50V2, on the other hand, is a modified version of ResNet50 [23], whose performance is better than that of ResNet50. eir input dataset consists of 180 images (300 × 300 pixels) of COVID-19-positive patients. Both Xception and ResNet50V2 produced an equal-sized 10 × 10 × 2048 feature map from their feature extractors.
ese feature maps are then concatenated, followed by a convolution layer. Confusion matrices showed that the concatenated network achieved 99.50% accuracy in classifying COVID-19 images with an overall accuracy of 91.4%.
Chowdhury et al. [66] presented a comparative study of various deep learning models, namely, DenseNet201, ResNet18, SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, ResNet101, CheXNet [67], and VGG19, for classifying chest X-ray images into three different classes, that is, normal, COVID-19, and viral pneumonia. ey have created a COVID-19 dataset of chest X-ray images. For doing this, they have received "Winner of COVID-19 Dataset Award" by Kaggle. Testing and training accuracies of four different CNN models have been presented. SqueezeNet achieved higher testing accuracy of 98.3%, whereas ResNet18 achieved higher training accuracy of 99.5%. Apostolopoulos et al. [68] incorporated the concept of transfer learning and

evaluated five well-known CNN models (VGG19, MobileNetV2, InceptionResNetV2, Inception, and Xception) on two chest X-ray databases for classification of COVID-19. VGG19 and MobileNetV2 were able to achieve higher accuracy of 98.75% and 97.40%, respectively, compared to other models in the case of two-class classification. For the three-class classification task, VGG19 achieved the highest accuracy of 93.48% among all other models under study.
Altan and Karasu [69] developed a hybrid model called EfficientNetB0 using deep learning, 2D curvelet transformation, and Chaotic Salp Swarm Algorithm (CSSA) for screening COVID-19 cases from X-ray images. Experimental results on X-ray images of 219 COVID-19 patients showed that the hybrid model has achieved the classification accuracy of 99.69%. At the same time, Brunese et al. [70] presented a transfer-learning-based model for classifying COVID-19 images from X-ray images with an accuracy of 97%. Ucar and Korkmaz [71] also presented a deep learning model based on light pretrained SqueezeNet for classifying COVID-19 from X-ray images. eir system firstly augments the raw dataset in an offline manner, followed by training of deep-SqueezeNet that takes advantage of Bayesian optimization and then tests the network for final

decision making. e main reason behind using Bayesian optimization is to optimize hyperparameters automatically.
e Bayesian optimization task calculates the posterior probability P(D|L) of a deep learning model using learned data. Experimental results on the COVIDx public dataset showed 100% classification accuracy in COVID X-ray images with an overall classification accuracy of 98.26%. Mahmud et al. [72] proposed a deep-learning-based model called CovXNet to extract various features from chest X-ray images. ey first trained their model with chest X-ray images of traditional pneumonia followed by COVID-19caused pneumonia because they possess almost the same kind of imaging features. Experimental results have shown that their system can provide multidilation classification with an accuracy of 97.4%.
On the other hand, Pereira et al. [73] also presented a deep learning model based on InceptionV3 for the identification of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. ey have performed multiclass classification using five famous classifiers and achieved an F1-score of 0.89 in classifying COVID-19 from another type of pneumonia. Performance analysis of several deep learning models for classification of COVID-19 from X-ray images is presented in Table 2. However, the datasets used in these works may not be the same. During this pandemic, plenty of researchers came with several pretrained and transfer-learning-based approaches for the classification of COVID-19 from chest X-ray and CT samples [74-78].
Along with CT and X-ray-based examinations, some clinical observations also play an essential role in detecting diseases. In this regard, Hosseiny et al. [67] presented a comparative study of clinical and radiological features of COVID-19 with existing SARS and MERS diseases. ey highlighted the importance of early CT findings for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Li et al. [79] presented an analysis of both clinical manifestations and COVID-19 imaging. On the other hand, Shah et al. [80] presented a comprehensive survey of several computational approaches for detection of COVID-19 from medical images.
5. Other Computational Approaches for COVID-19
Plenty of AI-based, statistical, and technological solutions are also provided by researchers in the area of COVID-19 research. Digital technology has several applications that can help plan and respond to COVID-19 pandemic [68]. is section highlights some of the works related to computational models for diagnosing and predicting COVID-19.
5.1. Machine-Learning-Based Approaches. Machine Learning approaches learn by extracting useful features from the data and can predict the futuristic trends/patterns using that learning. ese approaches proved themselves in providing support to the clinical diagnosis.
To assist the quick diagnosis of COVID-19 and analyze the epidemic trends, several Machine-Learning-based solutions have been presented by researchers. For a quick and

accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, a Random Forest (RF) based tool has been developed by Wu et al. [81]. e tool has extracted 11 blood indices from clinical blood test data and proved its validity by achieving 96% accuracy. Shi et al. [82] also developed a Random Forest based approach for automatic classification of CT samples based on infected lesions' size. Adjuik et al. [83] presented a Machine Learning approach based on neural network to generate protein vectors for preventing COVID-19.
On the other hand, Qi et al. [84] developed a model using Random Forest and linear regression for predicting the approximate stay of patients in the hospital due to COVID19. Another Random Forest based approach for identifying significant predictors and subsequent risk factors on mortality has been presented by Sarkar and Chakrabarti in [85].
ey have analyzed the clinical data of COVID-19 patients and presented that age is one of the essential parameters responsible for mortalities.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a famous classification approach that can assist in clinical diagnosis in early detection of COVID-19. Batista et al. [86] performed a comparative study of five Machine-Learning-based approaches, namely, ANN, RF, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosted Trees. ey have analyzed the clinical observations of 235 patients and presented all five algorithms' predictive accuracy under consideration. Among these approaches, SVM was able to predict the positivity of COVID-19.
On the other hand, Singh et al. [87] analyzed the daily confirmed cases data of the five most affected countries and presented one-month predictions using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) approaches.

Experimental results have shown the higher performance of LS-SVM by predicting a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases. Machine Learning approaches can be applied to viral sequence datasets for obtaining useful information. In this regard, Bzhalava et al. [88] used Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest techniques for classifying viral and nonviral sequences from metagenomic datasets. Ardabili et al. [89] presented a study of Machine Learning and soft-computing-based approaches for predicting COVID-19. ey observed that Multilayer Perceptron and Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) provided the best classification accuracy for predicting COVID-19. Hasan et al. [90] utilized Q-Q plot and ARIMA model to present the death rate based on time-series data of different states of India. Many other researchers [91-99] have presented the applications of Machine Learning approaches for early diagnosis and predicting the trends of COVID-19. Wang et al. [100] presented the epidemic trend using logistic and time-series prediction model called FbProphet. ey have analyzed the country-level daily COVID-19 data from John Hopkins University. e "Prophet" is a Facebook forecasting model that predicts the epidemic trends based on trend function, periodic term, influence, and the error term. First, they integrated the most recent data into the logistic model and then fed the cap values into the Prophet model to generate epidemic curves. Tuli et al. [101] emphasized the applications of Machine Learning and cloud-computing-based approaches in predicting the trend and the growth of COVID-19 from country-wise data obtained from Our World in Data [102].
ey have applied five different distributions on that data and observed that the Inverse Weibull function provides the best fitting distribution using the iterative weighting

approach. ere are numerous applications of AI in the COVID-19 pandemic. In this regard, Vaishya et al. [103] presented several applications of AI for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. e main applications highlighted by them include early diagnosis, treatment monitoring, contact tracing, cases/mortality projection, drug development, reducing the workload of health workers, and prevention of disease. Kumar et al. [97] analyzed several key parameters responsible for COVID-19 outbreak using two famous Machine Learning algorithms, namely, multiple regression analysis and multilayer feedforward neural network. ey have analyzed several parameters for finding out correlation with two main parameters, that is, total mortalities and total cases. Meraihi et al. [104] presented a critical analysis of several Machine-Learning-based approaches for detection, diagnosis, and prediction of COVID-19. To discover the COVID-19 patterns from recovered patients, a case study of Saudi Arabia was presented by Alafif et al. [105] using Association Rule Apriori (ARA) algorithm.
5.2. Industry 4.0 Based Approaches. e fourth industrial revolution, termed as Industry 4.0, also has the potential to provide solutions to some problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this regard, Javaid et al. [106] reviewed several technologies of Industry 4.0 and explored their applications in minimizing the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. ey have presented the applications of 10 leading technologies of Industry 4.0, namely, AI, IoT, Big Data, cloud computing, Virtual Reality, Holography, autonomous robotics, 3D printing, 3D scanning, and Biosensors, effectively. One of the essential aspects of Industry 4.0 is Big Data, which provides a massive amount of healthcare records, bringing the insight/surveillance of pandemics like COVID-19 [107].
e supply chain sector is one of the critical sectors which was critically affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Potentials of Industry 4.0 can minimize the impact of several challenges on the supply chain sector [108, 109]. Nowadays, the integration of IoT in medical technologies enables easy and transparent monitoring of patient's health [110]. Nowadays, this integration is sometimes referred to as the Internet of Medical ings (IoMT). Swayamsiddha and Mohanty [111] analyzed several applications of Cognitive Radio on IoMT. Modern technologies have several applications in pandemics, namely, disease tracking, health monitoring, predicting protein structures, drug discovery, and social awareness. Kumar et al. [112] and Chamola et al. [113] presented a comprehensive review of such technologies for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, Devi et al. [114] presented several applications of flying ad hoc networks (FANET) during COVID-19 pandemic.
5.3. Statistical Approaches. As compared to AI-based approaches, statistical techniques can provide detailed insights of daily, cumulative, country-wise data of COVID-19. Plenty of research has been carried out by researchers using statistical techniques to analyze the COVID-19 daily confirmed data. Zhang et al. [115] presented automated detection of

COVID-19 using the "AI Intelligent Assistant Analysis System" on chest CT images and statistical analysis using SPSS. eir AI-based chest CTscan analysis was proven to be capable of identifying COVID-19 rapidly as well as accurately. On the other hand, Contreras et al. [116] analyzed the trends and errors of the COVID-19 pandemic using statistical-based approaches only. ey initially defined random variables by modeling probability distribution functions followed by predictions using the ARIMA model.
ey have predicted the discharge rate by studying the cases, especially in Chile. Pandey et al. [117] analyzed COVID-19 outbreak data using Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) and regression. Using both approaches, they predicted the cases of COVID-19 so that preventive measures could be taken on time. Based on RMSLE, SEIR was observed to be outperforming the regression model.
On the other hand, a prospective space-time scan statistic approach to observe the daily COVID-19 data has been utilized in [118, 119]. e authors therein analyzed the daily data by observing the characteristics of clusters at the country level. Sometimes it has been observed that there are chances of delay as well as errors in daily confirmed cases and epidemiological variables. Similarly, Sarkodie and Owusu [120] analyzed the relationship between COVID-19 cases and demises. Along with this relationship, they have analyzed the relationship between several other attributes in diagnosing disease spread. On the other hand, time-series data can forecast healthcare resource requirements by analyzing confirmed and recovered cases [121, 122]. A review of several mathematical and AI-based models of COVID-19 analysis is presented by Mohamadou et al. [123]. ey have observed that most of the mathematical modeling related to COVID-19 analysis was based on two well-known methods, namely, SEIR and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR); meanwhile AI implementation was mainly based on CNNs using CXR and chest CT (CCT) samples. A survey of statistical approaches for analyzing the impacts of COVID-19 on global economy is presented by Verma et al. in [124].

Data collection is one of the essential steps towards the identification of any disease using deep-learning-based approaches. Generally, datasets of COVID-19 are categorized into two classes, namely, imaging data and statistical data, as shown in Figure 10.
As the name suggests, imaging data contains a chest CT scan and other radiographic images, that is, X-ray. Few such potential and famous imaging repositories for COVID-19 research are presented in Table 3. Few other datasets can be found in [125].
is type of data provides detailed insights into lung infections due to COVID-19, and the same can help in recognizing the disease. On the other hand, statistical data represents information like the total number of COVID-19 cases, total deaths, recovered cases, recovery rate, mortality rate, state, country-wise cases, and so forth. Most of the statistical data is about daily confirmed cases, which can be

obtained from [102, 132, 133]. Mohamadou et al. [123] have also provided 24 datasets (mix of text, images, prevalence rate, etc.) that can also be used for detection and classification of COVID-19 research. Such type of data helps in calculating and predicting the COVID-19 outbreak. In a brief period, several repositories containing CT scan images and X-ray have been reported. However, every work related to deep learning presented in the preceding sections is based on either CT scan or X-ray images. Most of the datasets are growing day by day as per the availability of new data.
7. Discussion
For better understanding of the works done by several researchers on the fight with the COVID-19 outbreak, it is essential to present a comprehensive survey of their insights. It is clear from the several works presented in this study that researchers are encouraged by the potential of deep-learning-based approaches in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. No doubt, deep learning has been successfully applied in solving various real-life problems. On the other hand, there are several pros and cons of using deep-learning-based approaches for solving problems. Some of them are pointed as follows.
7.1. Pros of Using Deep-Learning-Based Approaches. As compared to manual identification and recognition of diseases, deep learning provides several advantages if enough data is available for training. A few of the advantages are mentioned as follows:

(1) Requiring less amount of time for screening patients after completion of training.
(2) Providing the facility of automatic feature extraction even from unorganized data.
(3) Learning from examples. (4) Higher accuracy as compared to manual
examination.
7.2. Cons of Using Deep-Learning-Based Approaches. Despite several advantages, deep learning approaches also possess various limitations. A few of them are mentioned as follows:
(1) Inability to distinguish between several types of pneumonia.
(2) Lack of transparency and interpretability (sometimes it is hard to determine what imaging features are being used to determine output) [28].
(3) e gap between the responses of lungs concerning different diseases. No method can present various types of lung infections and their diseases (also cannot impact of other parameters such as age, immune status, drug reactivity, smoking, etc.)
(4) Deep-learning-based approaches generally expressing positivity or negativity of a disease but not able to predict the severity of a disease.
(5) Challenging to predict the output based on low quality/contrast images.

(6) Requiring a massive amount of data. Complex algorithms demand a high configuration of machines in CPU, Main Memory, dedicated GPU, and so forth.
7.3. Open Research Issues. It has been observed that in most of the works in which deep learning models and their variants were used, they were utilized mainly for binarized classification, that is, predicting the positivity and negativity of having COVID-19. Still, there exist several open research issues that need to be resolved over time:
(1) Considering real-world data while predicting and forecasting the epidemic trends because it has been observed that most of the predictions models were unable to predict the actual trends of COVID-19.
(2) Predicting the severity of disease using multiclass classification.
(3) Reducing the healthcare burden, especially that on health workers, using AI-enabled approaches.
(4) Predicting and forecasting mortalities, medical equipment, ICU/bed requirements, and other essential requirements.
(5) Development of hybrid datasets with enriched epidemical characteristics.
(6) Enhancing the prediction accuracies and deploying real-life solutions for coping with the COVID-19 outbreak.
(7) Analysis of social media trends along with real-time data in predicting the COVID-19 outbreak.
(8) Deploying AI-based postpandemic solutions that can minimize the impact and improve nations' economies.
8. Conclusion
e COVID-19 outbreak has affected almost all countries. For better prevention, timely diagnosis, social distancing, and isolation are the foremost requirements. Due to the rapid and exponential increment in COVID-19 cases, radiologists and hospitals are overburdened. Accurate and timely detection of 2019-nCoV is foremost required for reducing the burden on the healthcare sector. It is observed that AI-based examinations on CT scan and X-ray images are playing an essential role in diagnosing COVID-19. Nowadays, most of the radiologists are taking advantage of such approaches. e work embodied in this paper is focused on works done by several researchers using AI and deep-learning-based approaches for COVID-19 identification from two primary imaging modalities, that is, CT scan and X-ray. Most of the works reported for COVID-19 identification using deep learning approaches are based on the concept of transfer learning. However, a few of the researchers have developed their novel CNN architectures and claimed good accuracies. ere is no doubt that deeplearning-based approaches save the potential amount of time in screening COVID-19 patients. However, diagnosing diseases from imaging data alone does not fulfill the

minimum requirements. us, it is foremost required to combine these imaging diagnoses along with clinical observations for accurate and efficient diagnosis of COVID-19 so that we can try to minimize its outbreak. In the future, the task of automated COVID-19 identification may be extended towards severity identification and increasing the classification accuracies.

Abstract Introduction Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction which is typically presented with muscle weakness and excessive fatigability. Majority of MG patients require long-term immune suppression. Our aim was to analyze the frequency and severity of COVID-19 infection in MG patients, as well as the frequency of vaccinated MG patients against SARS-CoV-2. Methods We included 125 MG patients from the central Belgrade municipalities--60% females, age at MG onset 50.1±19.7 years, age at testing 61.7±16.8 years, anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR) positive 78% and muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) positive 8.6%. Results One-third of our MG patients had a COVID-19 infection and they were younger compared to those without verified COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 infection was registered in 28% of MG patients, mostly in elder subjects with comorbidities such as cardiac diseases and malignancies. MG worsening was noted in 21% of patients during/after COVID-19 and 42% had COVID-19 sequelae. Majority of MG patients were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (almost 70%). Vaccination was more common among MG patients with diabetes and in those with a milder form of MG. The most common types of vaccines were Sinopharm (42%) and Pfizer-BioNTech (25.6%). Adverse events were observed in 36% of vaccinated patients, with flu-like symptoms (77%) and local reactions (13%) being the most common ones. MG worsening was noticed in 5 (5.8%) patients after vaccination. Conclusion COVID-19 has placed a significant new burden for MG patients. Elder MG patients and patients with comorbidities are in higher risk of having adverse outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Percentage of vaccinated MG patients was higher than in general Serbian population.

Introduction
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction, which is typically presented with muscle weakness and fatigability [1, 2]. It is of note that respiratory muscles can also be affected in MG, leading to

respiratory failure and, rarely, lethal outcome [3, 4]. The first case of pneumonia caused by an unknown virus was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The virus was subsequently identified as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), and several months later the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 infection pandemic [5].
It is supposed that COVID-19 infection might affect MG patients in several ways. For instance, MG is considered as an immune-mediated disease which could have a bidirectional interaction with infections such as COVID-19. In particular, viruses (and other infectious pathogens) are one of the major environmental triggers of autoimmunity [6, 7]. Before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, viral and bacterial respiratory and urinary tract infections were the most frequent

reasons for hospitalization of MG patients [7]. Further on, patients with MG are usually on long-term immunosuppressive treatment regimens, which make them more susceptible to infections. For instance, only 32% of our MG patients were treatment-free after a 10-year follow-up period [8]. On the other hand, it has been shown that several medications, including the ones used for COVID-19 treatment (hydroxychloroquine and several antibiotics), and vaccines, can trigger MG exacerbation and myasthenic crisis in these patients [9, 10].
The official recommendation of Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that patients with MG, as a vulnerable population, should get vaccinated against SARSCoV-2 [11, 12]. Regardless of these recommendations, concerns not only about MG worsening after vaccination and their potential side effects, but also about its effectiveness in medically immunocompromised patients, are still present in both patients and doctors.
Therefore, our aim was to assess the frequency and other characteristics of COVID-19 infection in patients with MG, as well as to analyze the influence of this infection on the course of MG. We also analyzed vaccination rates against SARS-CoV-2 and their potential influence on the course of this autoimmune disease.
Methods
This cross-sectional study included patients who visited inpatient unit, day hospital and/or outpatient unit in a oneyear period before the pandemic (from January 1, 2019. to December 31, 2019) at the Neurology Clinic, University Clinical Centre of Serbia. The diagnosis of MG was established according to clinical, pharmacological, electrophysiological and immunoserological MGFA criteria [13, 14]. In this way, we have initially identified 220 patients who fulfilled the criteria. Forty-seven patients were excluded after a minimum of two attempts of telephone-contact, 43 patients refused to participate, three patients died before the COVID-19 pandemic, one patient had the diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and one patient had his MG diagnosis revised. Thus, a total number of 125 patients was included in the final analysis. Informed consent was obtained from all investigated patients.
Different sociodemographic data (including information about gender, age, age at the onset of disease, serological status, and severity of clinical presentation according to MGFA classification at the beginning and at the peak of the disease) were acquired from the medical informational system of the Neurology Clinic--InfoMedis. We have also collected data about different therapy modalities and comorbid disorders.

During the period of two months (November and December of 2021), data were collected using telephone questionnaires. This specifically designed questionnaire comprised four main domains: MG status at the time of testing, data about COVID-19 infection, data about vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, while the fourth section was filled only in the case of death. All data were obtained from patients or from specific contact persons if the patient had previously died. Severity of the disease was evaluated using the MGFA classification, and further dichotomized into mild (I-IIIA) and a more severe form (IIIB-V) of the disease [14]. Applied treatment modalities were divided into main groups: cholinesterase inhibitors, corticosteroids, non-steroidal immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine, cyclosporin A), therapeutic plasma exchange (PLEx) or intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) and experimental study drugs (efgartigimod, mezagitamab, and rozanolixizumab). Patients who had a verified COVID-19 infection from March 6, 2020 (first identified COVID-19 case in The Republic of Serbia) to the moment of testing were guided to the second domain of the questionnaire. Clinical severity of COVID-19 infection was divided into six categories (from "asymptomatic" to "mechanical ventilation needed") according to the WHO clinical progression scale [15], and further dichotomized into mild ("no hospitalization") and severe COVID-19 form ("hospitalized patients"). All patients who were vaccinated against SARSCoV-2 provided information about the type of vaccines they received. MG worsening was considered related to the infection/vaccination if happened during 6 weeks after first symptoms of COVID-19 or 6 weeks after any dose of the vaccine. Finally, heteroanamnestic data were provided for patients who had died, and it included the time of death, cause of death and its relation to COVID-19 infection.
In addition, using the MG-ADL scale (Myasthenia Gravis--specific Activities of Daily Living scale) we have evaluated data about MG status before and after COVID19 infection/vaccination of all patients who had a verified COVID-19 infection and/or were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 [16]. Experienced neuromuscular experts filled out the MG-ADL scale form according to the patient's recollection via phone call.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics methods were used to describe the population: proportion, mean and standard deviation. Chisquare test was used for comparison of non-continuous variables. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare continuous nonparametric variables and Student's t-test was used for parametric variables. The level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05.

Results
Main sociodemographic and clinical data of our examined MG patients are presented in Table 1. The mean age at testing was 61.7±16.9 years, and there were 75 (60%) female patients. Anti-acetylcholine receptor (Anti-AChR) antibodies were detected in 91 (78.4%) patients, muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies in 10 (8.6%), while 15 (12.9%) patients were diagnosed with double-seronegative myasthenia gravis (dSNMG). According to the MGFA classification, 94.1% of patients had mild MG forms at time of diagnosis. On the other hand, severe MG forms were present in 23.3% of patients, of which three patients needed mechanical ventilation. At time of testing, mild disease form was present in 72.5% of patients, while 22.5% were in MG remission. Different therapeutic modalities, applied both at time of diagnosis and time of testing in our cohort of patients, are noted in Table 1.
Characteristic of COVID19 infection in MG patients
COVID-19 infection was verified in 43 (34.4%) patients with MG. Milder COVID-19 forms were recorded in 72.1% of our patients, while 27.9% of patients had a more severe form of the disease (Table 2). Antibiotics which are considered as unsafe for use in patients with MG, such as macrolides and quinolones, were used in 11 (25.6%) patients with COVID-19. Sociodemographic factors of our MG patients, which were associated with a more severe form of COVID-19 infection, were patients' age at the moment of infection (51.5±13.3 years in patients with mild COVID19 vs. 67.5±16.7 years in patients with severe COVID-19, p<0.01) and the presence of comorbid disorders (42.3% of patients with comorbidities vs. 6.7% of patients without comorbidities, p<0.05). After further analysis of individual comorbid disorders, it was noted that 80% of patients with a cardiovascular disease had severe COVID-19 form compared to one-fifth of patients without the presence of cardiovascular diseases (p<0.01). Similar findings were observed in patients with a history of malignancy (100% vs. 24.4%, p<0.05).
Course of myasthenia gravis during and after COVID19 infection
Myasthenia gravis exacerbation during and after COVID-19 infection has occurred in nine (21.4%) patients. Mean time of MG exacerbation after the first symptom of COVID-19 was 23 days. Among these nine patients, four patients were not vaccinated, one patient got only the first dose of the vaccine, and four patients were completely vaccinated against

SARS-CoV-2 (two patients got the Sinopharm vaccines while two got the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines). In addition to COVID-19, two patients had other reasons for MG exacerbation, such as malignancy and a prolonged stressful situation. The average MG-ADL score before COVID-19 infection in patients who experienced MG exacerbation was 2.5±2.6 and 7.1±4.1 after infection, with an average difference of 4.8±4.8 and with a span from 2 up to 17 points. One of two patients who have died as a result of MG worsening was not vaccinated, while the other one was not completely vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (this patient got only one dose of Sputnik V vaccine). None of the investigated sociodemographic and clinical features of our cohort correlated with MG exacerbation during and after COVID-19 infection.
PostCOVID19 sequelae in MG patients
Post-COVID-19 sequelae were observed in 41.8% of MG patients, with cardiac arrhythmias, chest pain, dyspnea and hair loss being the most common. Novel autoimmune diseases after COVID-19 were not detected in our cohort of MG patients.
The relationship between vaccination against SARSCoV2 and MG
Up to 70% of our MG patients were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (Table 3). The main reason against vaccination in our group of patients was the fact that the patients did not want to get vaccinated. Most of the vaccinated patients received three doses of the vaccine (62.8%). Most frequently applied vaccines were Sinopharm (48.8%), followed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Sputnik V and AstraZeneca. Adverse effects after vaccination were recorded in 36% of patients, mostly presented as flu-like symptoms (including fever, headaches, chills, and muscle aches) and local reactions. Novel autoimmune diseases after vaccination were not observed in our cohort of MG patients.
Course of myasthenia gravis after vaccination against SARSCoV2
Myasthenia gravis exacerbation after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was documented in five (5.8%) patients, which appeared 6.3±3.9 days after vaccination. MG worsening was observed in three (7.1%) of 42 patients after Sinopharm vaccine and two (9.1%) of 22 patients after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The average MG-ADL score before vaccination of patients who had exacerbation was 2.0±2.3 vs. 7.4±5.6 after vaccination (average difference of 5.4±6.5, in the range from 2 to 17 points). Factors that have been shown to be statistically significant for MG worsening after vaccination were usage of non-steroidal

Discussion

The results of our study have shown that one-third of our MG patients had a COVID-19 infection. According to available WHO data, this percentage is insignificantly lower

among the general population of the Republic of Serbia (around 27% on the day of February 25th, 2022) [17]. Moreover, these data are in accordance with a Polish study where 33.3% of MG patients had COVID-19 [18]. On the other hand, previous studies from Turkey and France reported significantly lower prevalence of COVID-19 infection (0.96% and 13.5%, respectively) among patients with MG [19, 20]. The basic cause of these differences might be the disparity between the study conducting time and the course of the pandemic, as well as different prevalence among general population in these countries. For instance, the French cohort study included a shorter period (3 months) at the beginning of the pandemic when strict anti-epidemic and self-isolation measures were applied [20].
A more severe form of COVID-19 (hospitalization required) was recorded in approximately one third of our SARS-CoV-2 infected MG patients. These results coincide with data obtained in the Turkish study [19], but not with the results from the French cohort study where this percentage was nearly twice as high [20]. The explanation for this dissimilarity may be the fact that 60% of patients in the French study had a severe form of MG at the time of COVID-19 infection, while most of our patients had a mild form of MG.
The main risk factors for the appearance of the severe form of COVID-19 in our MG population were patients' age at the moment of testing and the presence of comorbid disorders (especially cardiovascular diseases and malignancies). Accordingly, the risk for developing a severe form of COVID-19 in the general population was associated with older age and different comorbidities such as cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus and several malignancies [21]. Lupica et al. reported that MG patients who died due to COVID-19 were older and had more comorbid diseases [22]. Thus, it seems that to-date literature data has identified same risk factors for the appearance of severe COVID-19 forms in both patients with MG and general population [23].
In one fifth of our MG patients who had COVID-19, MG exacerbation was confirmed during or after the infection. On the other hand, previous studies with smaller groups of patients showed a more significant prevalence of MG exacerbation (in a range from 50 to 87% of infected MG patients) [24-26]. However, observed contrast in reported disease deterioration could, at least partially, be explained by sociodemographic and clinical inter- and intra-cohort differences of comprised patients. For instance, our study included all MG patients from one territory, regardless of disease severity and remission status.
Post-COVID sequelae were present in 42% of our patients with MG. These data are in accordance with a general population study of Hirschtick et al., where post-COVID sequelae occurred in almost one half of the patients that had COVID19 [27].

Acta Neurologica Belgica
In our MG cohort, 69% of patients were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, which is higher compared to the general population of the Republic of Serbia (47% on February 23rd, 2022) and the WHO world data (55%) [28]. The main reason for this higher percentage of vaccination in our MG population could be the well-established advisory role of doctors, as well as patients' fear of getting a more severe COVID-19 form due to both their primary autoimmune disease and medical immunosuppression. However, a significant part of MG population was not vaccinated due to different reasons. It means that vaccinerelated skepticism is still present among MG population, and even doctors, mostly due to the revolutionary rapid development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [29]. It is of note that MG worsening after vaccination, analyzed by patient self-evaluation, was present in only 6% of vaccinated patients, primarily in patients on non-steroidal immunosuppressants and experimental study drug regimens. These findings were similar to the Italian cohort data where MG-ADL scores did not worsen in most of the patients after vaccination [22]. The main reason for primary disease worsening after vaccination in our patients could be the fact that this group of patients was generally presented with a more severe form of MG. Interestingly, compared to disease worsening after vaccination, MG exacerbation after COVID-19 infection was noted only in a slightly higher number of patients (nine (10.5%) of 89 vaccinated patients vs. five (11.6%) of 43 patients who had COVID-19 infection). Indeed, according to previous data MG worsening appears to be uncommon in COVID-19, appearing in only 10-15% of infected patients [25], which is similar to our findings.
The main limitation of our study is the telephone-based approach of obtaining patients' data since this may cause a recall bias. Further prospective longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate MG course and prognosis during and after the COVID-19 pandemic era. Despite these limitations, the study comprises a relatively large cohort of MG patients and provides useful data about the COVID-19 infection and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in a rare immune-mediated disease such as MG, offering valuable data for treatment and care of these patients.
Conclusions
COVID-19 has placed a significant new burden for MG patients. Elder MG patients and patients with comorbidities (especially with cardiovascular and malignant diseases) are in higher risk of having adverse outcome following SARSCoV-2 infection. Percentage of vaccinated MG patients was higher compared to general Serbian population, and MG worsening after vaccination was mostly seen among vaccinated patients with more severe MG forms.

Abstract
Peripheral facial paralysis (PFP) has been shown to be a neurological manifestation of COVID-19. The current study presents two cases of PFP after COVID-19, along with a rapid review of known cases in the literature. Both case reports were conducted following CARE guidelines. We also performed a systematic review of PFP cases temporally related to COVID-19 using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases on August 30, 2021, using a rapid review methodology. The two patients experienced PFP 102 and 110 days after COVID-19 symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasal samples through reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing. Anosmia was the only other neurological manifestation. PFP was treated with steroids in both cases, with complete subsequent recovery. In the rapid review, we identified 764 articles and included 43 studies. From those, 128 patients with PFP were analyzed, of whom 42.1% (54/128) were male, 39.06% (50/128) female, and in 23 cases the gender was not reported. The age range was 18 to 59 (54.68%). The median time between COVID-19 and PFP was three days (ranging from the first symptom of COVID-19 to 40 days after the acute phase of infection). Late PFP associated with COVID-19 presents mild symptoms and improves with time, with no identified predictors. Late PFP should be added to the spectrum of neurological manifestations associated with the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection as a post COVID-19 condition.

Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people and threatened global public health [1, 2]. After months of the virus spreading, cases of post-COVID-19 syndrome began to emerge, characterized by signs and symptoms that develop during or after infection, continue for more than 12 weeks, and cannot be explained by any alternative diagnosis. Post-COVID-19 conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems that people experience four or more weeks after being infected with the COVID-19 virus. Syndromes of post-viral manifestations have previously been reported in other pandemic events, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [3].
COVID-19 is a systemic disease that predominantly affects the respiratory system [4]. However, neurological changes may result from systemic complications of the disease, the direct effect of the virus on neurons, or an inflammation of the nervous system [5]. It is known that the SARS-CoV-2 infection is related to encephalopathies, central nervous system inflammatory syndromes, ischemic stroke, and peripheral neurological disorders; this relationship continues even after the acute phase of COVID-19 [6, 7]. Peripheral facial paralysis (PFP) occurs when there is a dysfunction of the facial nerve, usually affected in an inflammatory way, resulting in total or partial paralysis of facial movement. It is characterized by the involvement of the upper and lower areas of the face, which differentiates it from central peripheral paralysis, which only affects the lower portion [8]. It can be primarily referred to as Bell's palsy, with an incidence rate of 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 inhabitants [9] or secondary, caused by metabolic, cerebrovascular, and mainly infectious factors [10].
This type of paralysis has been associated with viral infections, mainly herpes virus [8]. More recently, the association of PFP with SARS-CoV-2 has been reported [5, 11-13]. The diagnosis is made by observing the signs and symptoms. It is not necessary to employ imaging devices because, in this case, the benefits do not outweigh the harm when performing these tests [14].
In the present study, we report two cases of late PFP that occurred after COVID-19 in healthcare professionals, along with results of a review of the current literature evaluating PFP patients' demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of COVID-19.
Methods
The CARE guidelines [15] were used in the present case reports. Patients provided informed consent for publication of the cases, and the project was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Federal University de Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil (protocol number 4.754.351).
Literature search strategy
A rapid systematic review was conducted, as recommended by Habby et al. [16]. The searches were conducted on PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library on August 30, 2021. The rapid

review protocol was registered under number 242075 on PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews). The search strategy consisted of different combinations of the following search terms: ("COVID-19" OR "SARS-CoV-2") AND ("Bell Palsy" [MeSH Terms] OR "Facial Paralysis"). The review did not have date or language restrictions. The articles in which PFP was characterized as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) were excluded. The complete search strategies can be found in Additional file 1.
Data extraction
One reviewer conducted the screening by titles, abstracts, and descriptors to identify articles for analysis. A second reviewer screened all excluded abstracts, and any conflicts that arose were resolved. Data extraction was done by one reviewer and checked ("checked" value = "1") for correctness and completeness by a second reviewer. A table was used to characterize the articles using the following information: article identification (by year, study site, and authors) and methodological profile of the article. When available, individuals' data were included: patient demographics (age, gender, number of evaluated subjects, differential diagnosis, and probable diagnosis) and country of study origin. When the data were not available in the articles, they were requested from the author.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive analysis is expressed as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and median and range for continuous variables. We present the results without meta-analysis due to the small numbers of studies currently available, considerable heterogeneity across studies and the high risk at bias that. Otherwise, the meta-analysis would produce a seemingly more accurate estimate than the underlying evidence is able to provide at this point in time.
Risk of bias assessment
Risk of bias assessment was carried out by one reviewer using the guidelines [15] recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Full verification of all judgments was performed by a second reviewer.
Results
Our search yielded 127 cases of PFP after COVID-19 in 43 studies. Most of the cases were reported in Turkey (5.46%) and the USA (5.46%), followed by Spain (4.68%) and France (3.12%). Hospitals were the primary study settings in 22.65%. Males accounted for 42.19% of cases. For 23 cases, the gender of the patient was not reported. The youngest patient was 15 months old, and the oldest one was 90 years old. One patient was primigravida, at 39 weeks' gestation (Table 1).
Physical therapy based on facial exercises, ocular hydration and eye protection were indicated as non-drug treatment [17, 18, 32, 33, 55].

Three papers described the occurrence of Bell's palsy in patients more than 30 days from their COVID-19 diagnosis [19, 39, 44]. Two articles were not included in the median calculation as they did not report this result. In the aforementioned two articles, the mean time between COVID-19 and PFP ranged from 7 to 12 days for three patients [47] and from 2 to 10 days in five patients [38]. In a study reporting 21 cases of nerve facialis [19], some patients presented associated diseases such as

hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiac diseases, asthma, and Behçet's disease, but the study did not report the distribution of these diagnoses. One patient was empirically treated with doxycycline for suspected borreliosis [34]. The other treatments as well as clinical features of patients with PFP after COVID-19 are presented in Table 2. In 38 (29.68%) cases of PFP, the information regarding the recovery was not described and, in 35 (27.35%) cases patients did not recover.

Case Report 1
A female patient (37 years old; a resident of Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; married; nursing technician; brown) started experiencing a headache and runny nose on September 16, 2020 and developed diarrhea, myalgia, anosmia, and adynamia. The patient underwent oro-nasopharyngeal swab sample collection on September 18 for an RT-qPCR test using the Allplex 2019nCoV real-time RT-qPCR kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). This multiplex assay uses oligonucleotides for the RdRP-gene (RNAdependent RNA polymerase), N-gene (nucleocapsid), and E-gene (envelope) as viral targets, and RNase P-gene (ribonuclease P) as the internal control. CT values  38 were considered positive. CT values were 26 for E-gene, 28 for RdRP-gene, 36 for N-gene, and 26 for RNase P-gene, confirming the positive result for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A serology for the detection of antiSARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by CLIA (Abbott) was performed on September 30, 2020 with a positive result.
There was a progressive regression of symptoms and, on September 25, 2020, she became asymptomatic. One hundred and ten days after the onset of symptoms of COVID-19, the patient presented severe squeezing pain in the left ear for six hours, with an intensity of 10/10, which radiated to the temporal and zygomatic regions. The pain ceased with the use of dipyrone (the patient could not recall the dosage). The next morning, she noticed lip rhyme deviation, went to an emergency care unit close to her home, and received a clinical diagnosis of Bell's palsy on the left side. She had no history of previous facial paralysis, labial or genital herpes, or other comorbidities. According to the House-Brackmann classification system, the damage resulted in moderately severe dysfunction in the patient (Grade IV).
The following drugs were prescribed orally: acyclovir 400 mg every four hours for 10 days; prednisone 60 mg for the first five days; prednisone 30 mg for the final five days; and prednisone 15 mg for five days. The patient underwent facial physiotherapy, with progressive improvement in her condition. Symptoms ceased in 15 days. The following laboratory tests were performed: serology for HIV (non-reactive), brucellosis 1st and 2nd samples (non- reactive), cytomegalovirus IgG (reactive) and IgM (non- reactive), Lyme IgG (non- reactive), and Lyme IgM (non- reactive). No imaging exams were performed.
Case Report 2
A female patient (39 years old; resident of Campo Grande, MS, Brazil, for 28 years; married; nurse; white) received a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection on September 19, 2020 through a real-time RT-qPCR test, performed for infection surveillance. The Allplex 2019-nCoV real-time RT-qPCR kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) was used and the CT values were 29 for E-gene, 29 for RdRP-gene, 30 for N-gene, and 28 for RNase P-gene. The patient was asymptomatic for four days after the test was collected, when she declared that she was experiencing myalgia, nausea, adynamia, nasal congestion, anosmia, headache, and cough. On September 27, 2020, she was clinically

evaluated and complained of right chest pain, with a diagnosis of pneumonia; prednisolone 10 mg was prescribed for five days. On October 9, 2020, the patient manifested tiredness, fatigue, headache, and presented tachycardia on physical examination. A beta-blocker (bisoprolol 2.5 mg daily) was prescribed due to tachycardia, with partial improvement. Subsequently, the patient continued to report anosmia and migraine. After 103 days since the COVID-19 diagnosis, the patient had mild paralysis on the right side of her face, and she was clinically diagnosed with Bell's palsy. According to the House-Brackmann classification system, the damage resulted in mild dysfunction (Grade 2). The patient had no history of previous facial paralysis, labial or genital herpes, or comorbidities.
The patient took 300 mg of dipyrone monohydrate, 35 mg of orphenadrine citrate, and 50 mg of anhydrous caffeine, orally, every eight hours for five days for pain and relief of muscle contracture of the mandible contralateral to the paralysis. She also underwent facial physiotherapy at home. In consultation with an otolaryngologist, due to tinnitus and right ear pain on December 8, 2020, she started using inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone furoate nasal spray, 27.5 mcg) for 14 days, and noticed an improvement in her migraine and otological symptoms. Her facial paralysis lasted for 10 days, and her symptoms progressively improved with partial recovery up to the time of this report.
A cranial MRI performed to investigate persistent migraine did not show any changes. The following serology tests were performed: HIV (non-reactive), brucellosis 1st and 2nd samples (non-reactive), cytomegalovirus IgG (reactive), IgM (nonreactive), Lyme IgG (non-reactive), and Lyme IgM (non-reactive).
Discussion
This study describes two cases of late PFP after confirmed COVID-19 infections. In the literature search, we retrieved 43 articles reporting patients with acute paralysis or idiopathic facial weakness associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous late cases of Bell's palsy weeks after the COVID-19 diagnosis have likely not been published as related to Sars-CoV-2. In this case, it is necessary to take into account the publication bias [56]. Although a problem may be relevant to the scientific community, many studies are published or not depending on the results.
Although facial paralysis has no gender predilection, our two reports involved female patients, as indicated in recent reports on the subject [11, 12, 24, 55]. The pathophysiology of the disease may be related to increased viral replication and dissemination in the axon, leading to demyelination and inflammation [57]. The severity of this condition can be measured by the addition of more neurological events, intensification of initial symptoms, ocular symptoms, and incomplete recovery after three months [5].
In general, the cases we have reported had benign courses with some degree of facial involvement. Patient 1 was classified as grade III, according to an assessment of facial movement using the House-Brackmann scale [58], with no movement in the forehead, incomplete eye closure with effort, and asymmetry of the mouth with maximum effort. Patient 2 was classified as

Cavalcante et al. J Venom Anim Toxins incl Trop Dis, 2022, 28:e20220020

Page 10 of 13

grade II, with moderate to good forehead function, complete eye closure with minimal effort, and mild asymmetry in the mouth. As a result of this systematic review, most cases were grade III [17, 25, 38, 44], which means that a large number of patients affected by paralysis had moderate symptoms.
The cases presented here diverge from the literature regarding temporality and the symptom itself; in other reports, paralysis has generally been described as the only symptom or as an initial symptom [11, 18, 20, 22, 33, 36, 38, 39, 55].
The cases described in this work presented other manifestations, such as cough, body pain, and myalgia. The paralysis occurred four months after symptoms and the COVID-19 diagnosis. The persistence of symptoms after the acute phase of COVID-19 has been discussed and the term long COVID is used for this purpose: when there are lasting effects of the infection after three weeks from the time of diagnosis. The virus can cause permanent damage to various organs, such as the heart, lung, and brain [59]. Therefore, we classify the cases presented here as long COVID.
Except for the anosmia presented by the two patients, the association of other neurological manifestations concomitant with the paralysis was not observed. In recent reports, the involvement of the facial nerve - during or after COVID-19 infection - was associated with the absence of deep tendon reflexes, ataxia, hypoesthesia, or paresthesia in the upper and lower limbs, being characteristic signs of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) [60-63].
The World Health Organization, in April 2020, determined that cases with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, GBS, and other acute neuropathies could be associated with SARSCoV-2 infection [5]. Our reported cases do not coincide with the concepts of probable and possible association described in the literature [64]. However, this definition of temporal association can be changed as new events have been reported throughout the pandemic [65].
Additionally, no changes in taste have been reported, although ageusia has emerged as one of the common symptoms of COVID-19 and these manifestations are present in cases of peripheral paralysis, when the topography of the lesion reaches the chorda tympani nerve, a branch of the facial nerve [66].
Treatment for paralysis aims to improve the facial mimicry of these patients and prevent sequelae. There is evidence that physiotherapy sessions can offer benefits for recovering facial mobility and improving the functionality of facial expressions, accelerating the recovery process [67]. In addition to physiotherapy sessions, the study patients used corticosteroids. One corticosteroid was associated with an antiviral. In the review, eight patients received the association of antivirals and corticotherapy, in consideration of a possible HSV infection [24, 32, 33, 36, 38]. Another 17 patients used antiviral drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir, valacyclovir, and acyclovir to treat paralysis [11, 25, 51, 53].

Finally, concerning the duration of symptoms mentioned in other articles on the subject, which ranged from six days for complete recovery [11] to 30 days for partial recovery [38], the total recovery of the facial mimicry of patients described in our report has an uncertain but promising prognosis.
There is a notable increase in described neurological manifestations including facial paralysis cases, with an onset time that can vary from two days to 60 days. Different from the observed in the rapid review, the two cases are considered late peripheral facial paralysis after COVID-19 because the onset of symptoms occurs more than 100 days after the onset of the disease.
The limitations of our study are inherent to the types of research included in the rapid review, which do not describe their limitations, making it difficult to compare with cases related globally. Additionally, the difficulty in differentiating isolated paralysis and facial paralysis associated with GBS is detected in the included articles. In our report, it was not possible to perform HSV serology due to lack of a kit in the reference laboratory. Also, MRIs were not performed in the acute period of the onset of facial paralysis. Due to the low CT, it was not possible to perform genetic sequencing of the virus.
Conclusion
In conclusion, cases of peripheral facial paralysis have been described in the literature, but they are limited to acute cases with descriptions of up to 60 days in duration. There is a wide variety of clinical protocols and treatments. We report two cases of PFP after confirmed COVID-19 infection, both presenting some symptoms related to COVID-19, with late neurological alteration. Considering that these two cases had no history of labial or genital herpes and that both cases had positive serology (IgG) for cytomegalovirus, this late symptomatology is a hypothesis that it is caused by Sars-Cov-2. The benign course of the disease demonstrated the diversity of complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the need for outpatient follow-up to observe possible late manifestations of FPF.

21 Abstract 22 Background / Objectives The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 is a serious public 23 health issue. Large-scale surveillance screenings are crucial but can exceed 24 diagnostic test capacities. We set out to optimize test conditions and implemented 25 high throughput pool testing of respiratory swabs into SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. 26 Study design In preparation for pool testing, we determined the optimal pooling 27 strategy and pool size. In addition, we measured the impact of vortexing prior to 28 sample processing, compared pipette- and swab-pooling method as well as the 29 sensitivity of three different PCR assays. 30 Results Using optimized strategies for pooling, we systematically pooled 55,690 31 samples in a period of 44 weeks resulting in a reduction of 47,369 PCR reactions. In 32 a low prevalence setting, we defined a preferable pool size of ten in a two-stage 33 hierarchical pool testing strategy. Vortexing of the swabs increased cellular yield by a 34 factor of 2.34, and sampling at or shortly after symptom onset was associated with 35 higher viral loads. By comparing different pooling strategies, pipette-pooling was 36 more efficient compared to swab-pooling. 37 Conclusions For implementing pooling strategies into high throughput diagnostics, 38 we recommend to apply a pipette-pooling method, using pool sizes of ten samples, 39 performing sensitivity validation of the PCR assays used, and vortexing swabs prior 40 to analyses. Our data shows, that pool testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection is feasible 41 and highly effective in a low prevalence setting.

1. Introduction

43

44 The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a serious public health problem of unprecedented

45 magnitude in recent times. In particular individuals at older ages or with comorbidities

46 are at a high risk to develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring

47 hospitalization and intensive care [1]. Therefore, it is essential to control person-to-

48 person transmission in order to protect vulnerable individuals and limit the number of

49 severe cases. Until herd immunity is achieved by vaccination, nonpharmaceutical

50 interventions need to be applied. Many countries could successfully contain the

51 spread of COVID-19 through social distancing or lock-down measures, contact

52 tracing, quarantine, and large-scale testing in the ongoing pandemic [2,3]. In order to

53 control viral transmission when lifting lock-down strategies, large-scale testing and

54 surveillance are critical interventions. These approaches are based on frequent tests

55 of individuals e.g. by rapid antigen-based tests or reverse transcription-real-time PCR

56 (rRT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in swab specimens. However, large-scale

57 surveillance screenings can exceed the test capacities of diagnostic laboratories.

58

Pooling swab specimens for PCR testing can increase test capacities and limit

59 the consumption of reagents [4]. Pool testing is highly efficient in a setting of low

60 disease prevalence and the availability of highly sensitive test methods [5]. It can be

61 applied to enable surveillance screenings of asymptomatic individuals in public

62 institutions e.g. hospitals, schools or retirement homes, which carry a high risk for

63 superspreading events and severe disease courses. When pool testing is

64 established, test conditions need to be optimized including (a) the type of pooling

65 strategy and pool sizes, (b) sample preparation and pooling method, (c) the quality of

66 SARS-CoV-2 detection by PCR. In this study, our aim was to determine and

2. Materials and Methods

70

71 2.1 Pool testing algorithm

72 Pooling efficiency was computed using a web tool published by Bilder and colleagues

73 [5,6]. Calculations were performed assuming a test sensitivity of 99% or 95% and a

74 test specificity of 99%. The expected number of tests was computed for different pool

75 sizes as described [5].

76

77 2.2 Swab specimens

78 Oropharyngeal or combined nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were collected and

79 transferred into MSwabTM Medium, UTM-RT/mini (COPAN Diagnostics, Murrieta,

80 CA), BD ESwabTM (Becton & Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA), Sigma Transwab®

81 Purflock® (Medical Wire & Equipment, Corsham, Wiltshire, England), or PBS. All

82 specimens were processed at the Institute of Virology, University Hospital of Cologne

83 within 12 hours after collection. Samples were stored for validation procedures at -

84 80°C.

85

86 2.3 Samples, clinical data and Ethics

87 All samples and clinical data were collected on the wards or outpatient departments

88 of the University Hospital of Cologne. No identifying data were used for the patient's

89 characterization. According to §15 subparagraph 3 (Professional Code for Physicians

90 in Germany) ethical principles of WMA Declaration of Helsinki were respected.

91 The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (Ethics Committee) of the

92 Medical Faculty, University Hospital Cologne, Germany (ethical vote no. 20-1638).

95

After arrival in our laboratory, samples were vortexed 5 seconds, and

96 preselected to be tested individually or in pools. To determine the cellular content of

97 the same specimens before and after vortexing, human -globin-gene quantification

98 was performed as published [7].

99

For the pipette-pooling method and to simulate various pool sizes, positive

100 specimens with various Ct-values were combined with increasing volumes of

101 negative samples combined as a stock, accordingly. For the swab-pooling method,

102 nine SARS-CoV-2 negative and one positive swab were used. After removal of the

103 transport medium, 1.2 ml PBS was added to the tube containing the swab and

104 vortexed 5 seconds. The PBS was then transferred to the next swab tube and

105 vortexed. Following this principle, ten swabs were merged. Preparation time was

106 measured.

107

108 2.5 Reverse transcription, amplification and detection with three instruments

109 (Instrument I) Nucleic acid extraction of 500 µl sample volume was performed using

110 the MagNA Pure® 96 DNA and Viral NA Large Volume Kit eluted in 100 µl elution

111 buffer, followed by amplification on LightCycler® 480 II (Roche Diagnostics,

112 Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Detection of

113 SARS-CoV-2 was conducted using the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0

114 (altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) or LightMix® SarbecoV E-gene plus equine

115 arteritis virus (EAV) control (TibMolBiol, Berlin, Germany). (Instrument II) Processing

116 of swabs was implemented with Panther Fusion® Hologic® and SARS-CoV-2 was

117 detected using 5 l of total RNA in 20 l of LightMix® SarbecoV E-gene plus -globin

118 as internal control (TibMolBiol, Berlin, Germany). As second target the N-gene was

119 amplified (inhouse primer sets in multiplex PCR, data unpublished). (Instrument III)

120 Detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed on a Roche cobas® 6800 using the

121 cobas® SARS-CoV-2 kit targeting the E-gene/ORF-1a/b regions according to 122 manufacturer's protocol. SARS-CoV-2 was quantified using dilution series of cell 123 culture supernatant extrapolated to approved standards (INSTAND e.V., Düsseldorf, 124 Germany), measured on all instruments, and Ct-values adjusted to Instrument III 125 (Cta). 126 127 2.6 Data analysis 128 For correlation analysis, a spearman's rank correlation was used. For comparing 129 globin-gene concentrations, a Mann-Whitney test was performed. To assess 130 statistical differences in Ct-values comparing pooling methods or PCR assays, a 131 multiple comparison one-way ANOVA was used. For comparing preparation times 132 and for matched-pair analysis, a paired t-test was used. The amplification factor was 133 calculated as published [8], Kruskal-Wallis test was performed. GraphPadPrism 7.0 134 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for statistical analysis. Figures were created 135 using Adobe Illustrator 18.1 (Adobe Inc.).

3. Results

137

138 3.1 Hierarchical pool testing

139 Pool testing can be performed using different strategies. In this study we conducted

140 two-stage hierarchical pooling procedures (Figure 1A). Swab samples were

141 combined and tested in a single PCR reaction. If the pool test was positive, the

142 remaining sampling material of the included specimens was retested separately to

143 detect the infected individual. If the pool test was negative, all individuals were

144 declared as not infected [5,9,10].

145

Pool testing efficiency depends on the disease prevalence. Bilder and

146 colleagues [5,6] proposed an algorithm to compute the expected number of tests

147 when performing two-stage hierarchical pool testing (Figure 1B and C). As the

148 disease prevalence increases, the reduction of PCR tests declines due to the

149 retesting of individual samples of positive pools. However, the pooling efficiency of

150 smaller pool sizes declines more slowly compared to pooling 20 or more samples.

151

At the time pool testing was initiated, the positivity rate at the University

152 Hospital of Cologne was 3.88% (Figure 1D). However, by excluding samples of

153 symptomatic individuals and recently positive tested persons, the positivity rate of

154 pooled samples was below 0.1%.

B: The reduction of PCR tests compared 158 to individual testing (continuous lines are nonlinear regression curves, outer dotted 159 lines are 95% or 99% test sensitivity, respectively) and C: the expected number of 160 tests for different pool sizes are shown.

D: The mean positivity rate per week of tests performed at the University 162 Hospital of Cologne and in Germany (as published [11]) are shown. 163 164 165 3.2 Pooling method and sensitivity of the PCR assays 166 Pool testing requires optimal sample conditions in order to minimize false negative 167 results. Pre-analytic factors can influence the test results. We could not detect a 168 significant difference in viral loads indicated by Ct-values comparing oropharyngeal 169 swabs with combined nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. However, samples taken in the 170 late phase of infection had significantly lower viral loads compared to earlier 171 timepoints (Supplementary Figure 2A and B). Therefore, pool testing needs to be 172 sensitive and safe in detecting even low virus concentrations. We investigated 173 whether vortexing increases the number of cells released from the swabs (Figure 174 2A). We measured the -globin-gene concentration in the medium of n=33 swabs 175 without vortexing and of the same specimens after 5 seconds of vortexing. The 176 average increase of -globin concentration after vortexing was 2.34-fold (95% CI 177 1.622-3.057; p=0.0001). In addition, we could detect SARS-CoV-2 in three 178 specimens in which vortexing reduced the Ct-value from 33.39 to 32.79, from 28.50 179 to 28.19 and from 35.58 to 32.87, respectively. 180

181 We compared two pooling strategies. For the pipette pooling, transport medium from

182 each of ten storage tubes were combined into one test tube. For the swab pooling,

183 transport medium was removed, PBS added to a first tube containing the swab,

184 vortexed, and transferred into a second swab tube followed by vortexing. After the

185 PBS had traveled through all ten swab tubes, it was transferred into a test tube

186 (Figure 2A). To test feasibility of both methods, four operators processed n=6 pools

187 applying both methods, respectively. The mean processing time was 3 minutes, 47

188 seconds for a swab-based pool (95% CI: (2 min,59sec.)-(4min,36sec.)) and 1

189 minute, 55 seconds for a pipette-based pool (95% CI: (1min,33sec.)-(2min,16sec.)).

190

In order to investigate the sensitivity, we generated 16 different pools with

191 each of the two pooling methods, by merging one SARS-CoV-2-positive sample with

192 nine negative samples, respectively (Figure 2A bottom right). The mean Ct of

193 individually tested samples was 28.41 (95% CI 26.17-30.66), 30.77 for the swab

194 pooling method (95% CI 28.79-32.75), and 31.18 for the pipette pooling method

195 (95% CI 28.92-33.44). There was no significant difference between Ct-values of the

196 two pooling methods. With both methods there was a single pool, which yielded a

197 negative test result (triangle shape in Figure 2A).

198

To compare the detection rates of three PCR systems used in our diagnostic

199 laboratory, ten-fold dilution series of n=20 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples were

200 simultaneously tested on three instruments (I, II, and III, referring to the Roche

201 LightCycler® 480 II, the Hologic Panther Fusion®, and Roche Cobas® 6800

202 System). Ct-values for e-gene amplification, included in all assays, were analyzed as

203 they yielded similar Ct-values compared to the second viral target, respectively

204 (Supplementary Figure 1C). As shown in Figure 2B and E, instrument I and III could

205 detect all undiluted samples whereas instrument II only detected 18 out of 20

206 samples. The mean Ct-values of the undiluted samples were 27.48 (95% CI 25.4-

207 29.57) for instrument I, 31.55 (95% CI 28.77-34.33) for instrument II and 28.44 (95%

208 CI 26.13-30.75) for instrument III (Figure 2D). When diluting the samples 10-fold,

209 instruments I and III could still detect all samples, whereas the detection rate of

210 instrument II was 70%. Instrument III could still detect 95% of samples at a 1:100

211 dilution and showed a slower decline of the detection rate compared to instruments I

212 and II. The amplification factors for the three instruments were 1.957 (CI 1.867-

213 2.149), 1.906 (CI 1.879-2.153) and 2.240 (CI 2.074-2.407), respectively (Figure 2C).

214 The lowest detectable copy number was 200 copies for instrument I, 2,000 for

215 instrument II, and 20 copies for instrument III as determined using two INSTAND

216 standards (Figure 2F).

217

To determine the detection-rate for different pool sizes, 25 positive samples

218 with Ct-values ranging from 18.96 to 34.99 were each diluted in a stock of negative

219 specimens and tested in duplicates on instrument III. All pools were SARS-CoV-2-

220 positive, however, for two pools the 1:20 and 1:50 dilution resulted in one negative

221 and one positive replicate, respectively (Figure 2G).

239 240 241 3.3 Integration of pool testing into the diagnostic routine of SARS-CoV-2 242 detection 243 The above experiments suggested the following as the optimal pool test conditions 244 for SARS-CoV-2 detection: (a) pooling 10 samples using the two-stage hierarchical 245 strategy; (b) vortexing the swab specimens before pooling; (c) applying the pipette246 pooling method, and (d) utilizing Instrument III for PCR testing. We set up a pool 247 testing facility, implemented features for pool testing into the laboratory software, and 248 systematically pooled up to 488 samples per day (Figure 3A). In order to limit the 249 number of positive samples run in pools, we preselected samples supported by 250 algorithms of the laboratory software. Patients that had been tested positive for 251 SARS-CoV-2 before or showed COVID-19-like symptoms were tested individually.

252 Pool testing was performed for surveillance screenings of patients and staff of as well

253 as for every patient admitted to the University Hospital of Cologne.

254

The mean percentage of reduced PCR tests was 85.77%. Decreased savings

255 of PCR reactions were due to retesting caused by technical issues or positive tested

256 pools. Within 44 weeks, 55,690 samples were tested in pools and only 4.7%

257 (n=2,640 samples) had to be retested individually (Figure 3B). As Figure 3C shows,

258 5,681 pools were analyzed from which 195 were positive. Another 86 pools were

259 retested due to technical issues. In total, 47,369 PCR reactions were saved by pool

260 testing. The Ct-values of 128 positive pools and the respective individual positive

261 sample strongly correlated (rs = 0.97, CI 0.96-0.98, p<0.0001) with a mean Ct-value

262 of 30.39 for pools and 27.38 for individual samples (Figures 3 D and E). Ct-values of

263 individual positive samples were adjusted to Instrument III. 82.86% of the samples

264 displayed Ct-values 35 and 17.14% >35 (Figures 3 F and G).

4. Discussion

278

279 Large-scale testing and surveillance screenings enable the rapid detection of clusters

280 of infections and help preventing superspreading events and uncontrolled

281 transmission of the virus until herd immunity by vaccination is reached. However, test

282 capacities are limited and PCR tests are cost-intensive. Pool testing is a feasible

283 option to enable high-throughput screenings without overwhelming capacities of

284 diagnostic laboratories. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation

285 addressing various aspects of pool testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However,

286 reports on this topic have recently been published [17-31].

287

Eberhardt and colleagues suggest forming subgroups if a pool yields a

288 positive result [20]. SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals need to be rapidly detected in

289 order to apply quarantine measures and perform contact tracing. Therefore, pooling

290 strategies need to be time efficient as well as suitable for high-throughput screenings.

291 Following these considerations, we decided to use two-stage hierarchical pool testing

292 with a pool size of ten samples. Increasing pool sizes, and forming subgroups after a

293 positive result, could further improve test efficiency [20] but would delay the test

294 result for the individual specimen. In a low prevalence setting with restricted test

295 resources and a neglectable time aspect, for instance in developing countries,

296 increasing pool sizes and forming subgroups is a reasonable option. Another

297 approach is the combinatorial pool testing strategy [24,25,32]. Here, samples are

298 assigned into multiple pools which enables the detection of infected individuals in a

299 single round of testing. In our study, we used the hierarchical testing strategy due to

300 logistics of a high-throughput diagnostic setting.

301

Pre-analytical handling can substantially impact test sensitivity, however,

302 limited data on this topic are available. Test results are influenced by improper

303 transport conditions, variations of the sampling device (flocked vs. cotton swabs), the

304 transport media [33,34] as well as the anatomical structure of the pharynx

305 (Mallampati score). We could not observe differences in Ct-values comparing

306 oropharyngeal and combined nasal/oropharyngeal specimens. This is in line with

307 findings of Woelfl et al., describing no differences in viral loads or detection rates

308 when comparing nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens [35]. In addition,

309 high viral concentrations and detection rates in salvia compared to nasopharyngeal

310 swabs were reported [29,36] and saliva samples can be used for pool testing [37].

311

In our study, different operators performed specimen collection, which could

312 be a limitation of the data, as analyzed by Basso and colleagues. Two different

313 operators collected 70 swabs each and a high variability of test results was observed

314 [38]. This effect should not be underestimated.

315

316 We developed a feasible pooling procedure that can readily be implemented in

317 diagnostic routines. The preparation for pool testing contained besides extensive

318 technical investigations, also changes in the laboratory logistics and adaptions of the

319 laboratory software. The data communicated here will contribute to the process of

320 finding and implementing a consensus pool testing strategy enabling larger test

321 capacities to effectively combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Abstract Introduction: The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on allergic diseases is not certain, as people's living habits and the environment have been affected by the pandemic. The present study described the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the allergen sensitization rate in patients with allergic diseases in central China. The results provide reliable epidemiological data for the prevention and control of allergic diseases during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: Data were collected from a total of 6,915 patients with symptoms of allergic diseases who visited the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in China for allergen testing from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021. Patients were divided into a children group (<14 years old), youth group (1544 years old), middle-aged group (4559 years old), and elderly group (>60 years old). Immunoblotting was used to detect 20 serum allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) antibodies in patient serum samples. We compared the positive rates of various allergens in different age and sex groups before and during the COVID-19 epidemic, and the prevalence data of sIgE sensitization were analysed. Results: Among the 6,915 patients

with symptoms of allergic diseases, 2,838 (41.04%) patients were positive for at least one of the allergens. The top three positive rates of inhaled allergens were Dermatophagoides farinae (1,764 cases, 25.51%), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (1,616 cases, 23.37%), and house dust (645 cases, 9.33%). The top three positive rates of food allergens were eggs (686 cases, 9.92%), milk (509 cases, 7.36%), and crabs (192 cases, 2.78%). The total positive rate of allergens was higher in men (46.99%) than in women (37.30%). Compared to 2 years before the COVID-19 epidemic, the rate of sensitization to indoor inhalant allergens increased, but outdoor inhalant allergens showed no significant change. The positive rates of milk and eggs peaked during the outbreak of COVID-19 (2020) then declined in 2021. The total positive rate of allergens was higher in males than females before and during the COVID-19 epidemic, but more allergens were different between males and females during the pandemic. Compared to middle-aged and older adults, the children and youth groups were more susceptible to allergic diseases, and they exhibited an increasing positive rate for most common allergens, especially indoor inhalant allergens, during the COVID-19 epidemic than before the pandemic.

pteronyssinus and D. farinae are the most common allergens in South China. Under the background of normalization of epidemic prevention, indoor inhaled allergens should be first in the prevention and control of allergic diseases, and a combination of various indoor cleaning measures should be used to improve the efficiency of interventions.

ited a hospital in Central China for allergen testing before and during the epidemic. We calculated the positive rates of various allergens in patients of different ages and sexes to evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence pattern of allergens. The results provide reliable epidemiological data for the prevention and control of allergic diseases during normalized epidemic prevention.

Introduction
Allergic diseases have become a global public health problem and produce significant socioeconomic burdens. Allergic diseases include eczema, atopic dermatitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis. Food allergies affect more than 25% of the population in industrialized countries, and the sensitization rate is increasing in developing countries [1, 2]. Complex gene-environment interactions likely trigger allergic diseases and affect the development of allergic diseases [3]. Several factors, including climate change, pollution, reduction in biodiversity, urbanization, and changes in lifestyle and eating habits, contribute to changes in the allergen prevalence pattern [1, 2, 4]. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), local governments have called on people to adopt various epidemic prevention measures including the wearing of masks, social distancing, strengthening of hand hygiene, and controlling crowd gatherings to stop viral production. People spent more time at home. Outdoor entertainment activities were greatly reduced, and most inperson shopping changed to online shopping. Most schools had delayed openings, classroom courses were changed to online teaching, and remote working became trendy. The changes in people's living habits and the environment may have transformed the type and frequency of allergens that people were exposed to compared to previous years before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on allergic diseases is not certain.
An accurate diagnosis of allergic diseases is essential to prevent and delay disease development [5]. Allergen testing methods include the patch test, skin prick testing, serum-specific IgE (sIgE) testing, and basophil activation testing. Serum allergen sIgE detection exhibits a high safety profile and provides relatively reliable results, which played a significant role in the prevention and control of allergic diseases during the pandemic. Our study analysed the serum allergen sIgE detection results of 6,915 patients with symptoms of allergic diseases who vis-

Subjects and Methods
Study Population A total of 6,915 serum allergen sIgE antibody detection data were obtained from the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in Changsha, Hunan Province, from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021. Approximately 90.5% of the patients lived in urban areas, and only 6.3% were from rural areas. Approximately 3.2% of the patients had incomplete address information or could not be contacted. We collected the data of patients with suspected or diagnosed allergic diseases, including eczema, atopic dermatitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis. The data we collected included the date of blood sample collection, age, sex, and the sIgE test results of 20 allergens. Our data included 1,275, 1,677, 1,599, and 2,364 patients in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, with 2,660 male patients and 4,255 female patients. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1.60. The age ranged from 1 to 97 years old, the average age was 30.65 years old, and the median age was 29 (18, 45) years old. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The Detection Method Professional staff detected patient serum sIgE using the URANUS AE 85 automatic enzyme immunoassay instrument (Jiangsu Akcome Science & Technology Co., Ltd., China). Allergens detected by the allergen sIgE antibody detection kit (Jiangsu Haoobo Biomedical Co., Ltd., China) included Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, cat epithelium, dog epithelium, peanuts, soybeans, milk, crab, shrimp, eggs, beef, cod, wheat flour, lamb, house dust, cockroach, Alternaria, willow, ragweed, and mugwort. Sample preparation method: five millilitres of peripheral venous blood drawn from the patient was centrifuged (3,000 r/min for 10 min), and the upper serum was taken. The laboratory staff operated the testing equipment for allergen detection. Experimental principle: the system used the enzyme-linked immunocapture method, which first captures all IgE antibodies in the serum using anti-IgE antibodies encapsulated on a solid-phase carrier. Known standard liquid-phase allergens were added to bind to IgE antibodies. The enzyme-labelled antibody and substrate were added, and the enzyme catalysed the chromogenic reaction of the substrate. The absorbance of the end product was detected to reflect the slgE content of the sample. The grading and interpretation of the results followed the international standard [6]. Grading criteria: grade 0 (0 to <3.50 IU/mL), grade 1 (0.35 to <0.70 IU/ mL), grade 2 (0.70 to <3.50 IU/mL), grade 3 (3.50 to <17.50 IU/ mL), grade 4 (17.50 to <50.00 IU/mL), grade 5 (50.00 to <100.00 IU/mL), and grade 6 (100.00 IU/mL). A result equal to or greater than 0.35 indicated a positive reaction.

Results
Analysis of Epidemiological Data of Serum Allergen sIgE Detection in 6,915 Patients Figure 1a and b show the total positive rates of each inhaled and food allergen in 6,915 patients, respectively. Among the 6,915 patients, the three inhalation allergens with the highest positive rates of sIgE antibody were D. farinae (1,764 cases, 25.51%), D. pteronyssinus (1,616 cases, 23.37%), and house dust (645 cases, 9.33%). The top three positive rates of food allergens were eggs (686 cases, 9.92%), milk (509 cases, 7.36%), and crabs (192 cases, 2.78%). As shown in Figure 1c, children and young people accounted for the largest proportion of most allergens, and the largest proportion of allergens in the children group were milk (81.34%), Alternaria (69.86%), eggs (64.29%), and wheat

flour (61.54%). The allergens with the largest proportion in the youth group were D. pteronyssinus (64.79%), D. farinae (63.38%), cat epithelium (74.68%), dog epithelium (73.68%), house dust (48.68%), cockroaches (70.67%), willows (71.43%), ragweed (47.62%), mugwort (69.88%), and crabs (60.94%) (p < 0.05).
Positive rate test analyses for inhaled allergens showed statistically significant differences between the 4 years in D. farinae, cat epithelium, dog epithelium, house dust, cockroaches, willows, ragweed, and mugwort. For food allergens, positive rate test analyses showed statistically significant differences over the 4 years in peanuts, milk, crabs, shrimp, eggs, beef, and wheat flour (p < 0.05) (Table 1). Figure 1d shows that the sensitization rate of inhaled allergens included D. farinae, house dust, cat epithelium, and dog epithelium, which showed an increasing trend over time, and cockroaches showed a decreasing trend. Among the food allergens, the positive rates of eggs, milk, wheat flour, and shrimp increased annually until reaching a peak in 2020, then decreased (p < 0.05). However, the positive rate of crabs increased annually (Fig. 1d).

Among the 6,915 patients, the total positive rates of male patients and female patients were 46.99% (1,251/2,660) and 37.30% (1,587/4,255), respectively. Compared to female patients, positive reactivity to inhaled allergens, including D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae, house dust, cockroaches, Alternaria, mugwort, and food allergens, including peanuts, milk, crabs, and shrimp, was higher in male patients (p < 0.05) (Table 2).
Table 3 shows that the differences in the positive rates of allergens in different age groups were statistically significant for allergens, including D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae, house dust, cat epithelium, dog epithelium, cockroaches, Alternaria, peanuts, milk, eggs, and wheat flour (p < 0.05). The allergens with the highest positive rates in the children group were eggs (32.84%), D. farinae (31.05%), and milk (30.83%). The allergens with the highest positive rates were D. farinae (28.11%) and D. pteronyssinus (26.33%) in the youth group, D. farinae (14.93%) and D. pteronyssinus (12.68%) in the middle-aged group, and D. farina (13.04%) and D. pteronyssinus (6.42%) in the elderly group. No differences were found in other allergens between the four groups.

Changes in the Positive Rates of Various Serum Allergen sIgE Detection during the COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2021) Compared to before the COVID-19 Pandemic (2018-2019) As shown in Figure 2a and b, the positive rates of indoor inhaled allergens, including D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae, house dust, cat epithelium, dog epithelium, and house dust, increased significantly in the 2 years during the pandemic compared to the 2 years before the pandemic, and the positive rate of cockroaches was lower than before the pandemic (p < 0.05). The positive rates of food allergens, including milk, eggs, and crab, increased, and the positive rates of peanuts and beef decreased (p < 0.05). No differences were found in other allergens before and during the pandemic (Table 4). Among the 6,915 patients, the total positive rate of allergens in males was 41.44% (455/1,098) and 33.87% (628/1,854) in females before the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the positive rate of allergens in males was 50.90% (795/1,562) and 39.94% (959/2,401) in females. The positive rates of allergens in males were higher than females in these two periods (p < 0.05). Compared to 2 years before the COVID-19 epi-

demic, the total positive rates of allergens were higher during the epidemic in males and females, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2c). Compared to the 2 years before the pandemic, the positive rate of males was higher than females for the allergens cat epithelium, cockroaches, peanuts, and eggs during the pandemic. The positive rates of allergens, including D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae, house dust, cockroaches, Alternaria, peanuts, milk, crabs, and shrimp, in males were higher than females, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05) (Table 5).
We also analysed the positive rates of serum allergens in different age groups of the 6,915 patients. The total positive rates of allergens in the children group (<14 years old), youth group (1544 years old), middle-aged group (4559 years old), and elderly group were 58.92% (337/572), 35.67% (616/1,727), 22.43% (109/486), and 12.57% (21/167) before the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively, and that the rates during the pandemic were 72.37% (558/771), 42.58% (958/2,250), 26.52% (73/626), and 23.10% (73/316), respectively. The total positive rates of allergens in the younger group were significantly higher than those in the older group (p < 0.05), but not for the

middle-aged group or elderly group during the pandemic (Fig. 2d).
Compared to the 2 years before the pandemic, the positive rates of D. pteronyssinus, cat epithelium, house dust, Alternaria, milk, crab, eggs, beef, and wheat flour in the children group were higher. The positive rates of D. farinae, cat epithelium, peanuts, milk, crab, eggs, and beef in the youth group were higher during the pandemic and cockroaches were lower. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Only the positive rates of dust mites increased in the middle-aged group and the elderly group during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). No differences were found in other allergens (Table 6).
Discussion
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic profoundly changed people's lifestyles and living environments, but the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on allergic diseases was rarely studied. Some studies showed that the COVID-19 pandemic caused asthma by triggering respi-

ratory dysfunction. Patients with allergic diseases, such as asthma, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 after infection [7]. However, a recent sub-cohort study evaluated long-term COVID-19 symptoms at Stanford. This study showed that asthma was not a risk factor for more severe COVID-19. Non-allergic asthmatic patients had twice the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 compared to allergic asthmatic patients. Lower levels of eosinophils were related to more severe COVID-19 disease [8]. Eosinophil counts are allergic biomarkers. However, most COVID-19 patients had reduced blood eosinophil counts [9]. Therefore, more research is needed to examine whether patients become more or less sensitized to COVID-19 infection.
Changes in lifestyle and living environment may alter people's susceptibility and the population distribution of various allergens [10]. Therefore, it is of great significance to master the epidemiological data of allergic diseases for the prevention and control of allergic diseases during the

COVID-19 pandemic. Among the 6,915 patients with allergic diseases in this study, the three inhalation allergens with the highest positive rates were D. farinae (25.51%), D. pteronyssinus (23.37%), and house dust (9.33%), and the three food allergens with the highest positive rates were eggs (9.92%), milk (7.36%), and crab (2.78%). D. farinae is the most common inhaled allergen in our city in Central China. The distribution of allergens varies in different regions due to the geographical environment, climatic conditions, and lifestyles. China has a warm and humid subtropical climate, and D. farinae is the most common allergen in most parts of China. D. farinae has strong antigenicity, and live mites, mite corpses, and mite faeces are allergenic. They are found in pillows, mattresses, fabric sofas, carpets, and air conditioning filters. D. farinae is the most common unavoidable allergen. D. farinae grows quickly, has a strong reproductive ability, and is difficult to completely remove [11].

The Change of Allergens since the

Outbreak of COVID-19

DOI: 10.1159/000526892

The age distribution of different allergens in the children and youth groups accounted for the largest proportion of most allergens. Food accounts for a large proportion of the allergens in children. Inhaled allergens accounted for a large proportion of young people and elderly individuals. Children are more likely to be allergic to food allergens because the gastrointestinal barrier function and the mucosal immune system are not fully competent. The function of the gastrointestinal tract is more complete in youth and older populations, and inhalation allergens gradually predominate [12]. Previous studies have reported that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for food allergy in children [13-16]. During the epidemic, the increased rates of food allergen positivity may be related to the reduced outdoor activities of children and their short exposure to sunlight. There was a statistically significant difference in the positive rates of allergens between the sexes. The total positive rate of allergens in men was higher than in women, and men were more susceptible to most allergens than women, which is consistent with the literature [17, 18].
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, people's living habits and living environment have dramatically transformed compared to before the pandemic. Our data showed that the sensitization rate of indoor inhaled allergens, including D. farinae, D. pteronyssinus, cat epithelium, dog epithelium, and house dust, increased in the 2 years during COVID-19 compared to the 2 years before the outbreak of COVID-19, which is consistent with the literature [7, 19]. The government tightened controls during the outbreak, and people went out less and isolated themselves as much as possible. Therefore, the exposure time and frequency of indoor allergens increased significantly compared to outdoor allergens. Staying at home for a long time without frequent ventilation and insufficient sunlight may also increase the sensitivity to indoor allergens [7]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the sensitization rate of food allergens, including eggs, milk, and crabs, peaked in 2020. During the epidemic, people paid more attention to diet and strengthening their nutrition. Eggs and milk are the most common and easily available high-protein foods. Patients with mild allergies or suspected patients were likely to reduce hospital visits during the COVID-19 epidemic. As the epidemic was brought under control in 2021, people's lifestyles gradually returned to normal in 2022. The level of food allergens dropped to pre-epidemic levels in 2021. However, the positive rate varied depending on the severity of the epidemic and epidemic prevention measures in different areas. During the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, more allergens showed differences between men

and women than before the outbreak, and the positive rate of men was higher than women. One study of allergic asthma found that boys had higher atopy and allergen sensitization than girls in childhood, but the opposite was true in adulthood. The change may be related to sex hormones and airway diameter [20]. Therefore, the effect of sex on allergen susceptibility must be further explored.
In the context of the normalization of epidemic prevention, the incidence of allergic diseases related to indoor allergens is gradually increasing. Reducing exposure to indoor allergens is a key measure for the prevention and control of allergic diseases. The results of a systematic review abroad suggested that the combined use of acaricides, air purification, carpet cleaning, high-efficiency particulate air filtration vacuum cleaners, mattress covers, mould removal, pest control, and pet cleaning reduced indoor allergies to a certain extent. However, the effect of a single intervention was not clear or ineffective, and no combination of specific interventions was more effective [21]. Therefore, a combination of various intervention measures should be used as much as possible in the prevention and treatment of indoor inhaled allergens to improve the intervention effect. Cross-reactivity and/ or co-sensitization of allergens, such as myosin, and arginine kinases in insects were demonstrated in patients with D. pteronyssinus and seafood allergies. Researchers recently found that processing and digestion did not reduce the sensitization of insect pan-allergenic myosin and arginine kinases. Therefore, patients with D. farinae allergies should be cautious in eating foods that may contain cross-allergens, such as shrimp and mealworms [22].
The present study has some limitations. It was a retrospective study, and the positive rate varied depending on the severity of the epidemic and epidemic prevention measures in different areas. Therefore, it only represents the allergen changes in one urban area in central China before and after the COVID-19 epidemic. More regional data are needed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on allergic diseases in the future.
For normalization of epidemic prevention, the data in the present study showed that the positive rates of indoor inhalant allergens and most common food allergens, including eggs and milk, increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Indoor allergens should be placed first in the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases, and a combination of various indoor cleaning measures should be used to improve the efficiency of interventions. The study provides reliable epidemiological data and guiding advice for the prevention and control of allergic diseases during normalized epidemic prevention.

Abstract Introduction: Communities of color have faced disproportionate morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, coupled with historical underrepresentation in US clinical trials, creating challenges for equitable participation in developing and testing a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: To increase diversity, including racial and ethnic representation, in local Los Angeles County NIH-sponsored Phase 3 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials, we used deliberative community engagement approaches to form a Community Consultant Panel (CCP) that partnered with trial research teams. Thirteen members were recruited, including expertise from essential workers, community-based and faith-based organizations, or leaders from racial and ethnic minority communities. Results: Working closely with local investigators for the vaccine studies, the CCP provided critical insight on best practices for community trust-building, clinical trial participation, and reliable information dissemination regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Modifying recruitment, outreach, and trial protocols led to majority-minority participants (55% - 78%) in each of the three vaccine clinical trials. CCP's input led to cultural tailoring of recruitment materials, changes in recruitment messaging, and supportive services to improve trial accessibility and acceptability (transportation, protocols for cultural competency, and support linkages to care in case of an adverse event). Barriers to clinical trial participation unable to be resolved included childcare, requests for after-hours appointment availability, and mobile locations for trial visits. Conclusion: Using deliberative community engagement can provide critical and timely insight into the community-centered barriers to COVID-19 vaccine trial participation, including addressing social determinants of health, trust, clinical trial literacy, structural barriers, and identifying trusted messenger and reliable sources of information.

Introduction The use of vaccines to prevent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical to the
reduction of disproportionate pandemic-related morbidity and mortality in racial and ethnic minority communities that have seen declines in life expectancy due to COVID-19.1-4 Early in the pandemic, there were low racial and ethnic minority participation rates in phase I and II clinical trials.5 Historical underrepresentation of minorities in clinical trials,6,7 including vaccine trials,8,9 presented a critical challenge to the successful development, testing, and use of a safe and efficacious vaccine by those who need it most. Underrepresentation of participants from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds may have implications for the generalizability of clinical trial results, given the efficacy and safety of medical treatments may differ by race or ethnicity.10 Enhanced representation of diverse groups in vaccine trials may also enhance subsequent vaccine uptake,5 increase equitable access to other timely or novel treatments, and contribute to our understanding of health disparities. Thus, early in the inception of COVID-19 vaccine trials, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) identified increasing accessibility to underrepresented populations as a priority and vital to providing equitable protection from COVID-19.
To address enrollment gaps in COVID-19 clinical trials, we collaborated with NIHsponsored Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial teams in Los Angeles County to convene a Community Consultant Panel (CCP), an advisory group designed to provide community feedback and recommendations to improve the recruitment and retention of minority participants. The goals of the CCP were to help increase participant diversity and representation--by race/ethnicity, essential worker occupation, and geography by recruiting CCP members from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups from communities with high rates of infection, morbidity, and mortality--in local COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and provide access to accurate information about clinical trials to communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Assuring diversity amongst trial participants was particularly relevant as California has the highest number of COVID-19 cases nationwide, with 32% percent of cases in Los Angeles County, one of the country's most populated and racially diverse counties.11 We describe our approach to forming the CCP, how recruitment strategies were modified, and enrollment outcomes across three local vaccine trials. We summarize actionable strategies recommended by the CCP to improve the engagement of minority populations in COVID-19 vaccine trials within our academic institutions.

Materials and Methods The CCP was rapidly formed by the UCLA Clinical and Translational Research
Institute's (CSTI) Community Engagement & Research Program (CERP) to support three COVID-19 clinical trial research teams across Los Angeles County with clinical trial recruitment and retention (UCLA CARE Center, Harbor UCLA/Lundquist Institute, and UCLA Vine Street Clinic) enrolling into two NIH-funded COVID-19 clinical trials (AstraZeneca and Moderna). The CCP had several roles: to consult with academic clinical trial researchers, health professionals, and other Los Angeles-based community leaders, to identify barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial participation across diverse communities in Los Angeles County, and to provide recommendations for enhancing clinical trial participation in diverse communities. Deliberative Community Engagement
We used a Deliberative Community Engagement (DCE) approach to understand and enhance clinical trial recruitment and implementation and better understand and address the pervasive lack of diverse representation in clinical trials. DCE has been used to examine and obtain community input on a variety of complex health and social issues.12-15 The process allows participants to consider relevant information from multiple points of view and involves: recruiting a sample of relevant stakeholders (regarded as experts in how the topic at hand concerns or affects the population at risk) to serve as deliberates; engage in educational activities to ensure stakeholders have a working knowledge of the technical issues at hand, as well as clinical, social, and other trade-offs; facilitate discussion so participants can clarify their values and understand others' perspectives; and develop and discuss specific recommendations.12 CCP Member Recruitment
Representatives from communities with a high risk of COVID-19 due to race/ethnicity and/or age, occupation (e.g., essential service industries), or geographic region served were identified by members of the CERP academic-community collaborative based on occupations, regions, poverty level, and ages with higher than average COVID-19 cases reported by Los Angeles County. A list of recommended candidates was circulated to the CERP community partners and academic faculty, who then ranked individuals to ensure representation from all potential professional sectors and communities (race/ethnicity, occupation type or organization, geographic area) as well as noting any previous experience working with the individual such as
https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2022.471 Published online by Cambridge University Press

previous CBPR projects, CTSI community partners, and personal and professional networks. The clinical trial team tabulated, reviewed, and discussed ratings to select 13 candidates. Invitations were sent to panelists defining the role of the consultant, participation expectations, and compensation. CCP Structure and Curriculum
Because of the immediate need to implement trial protocols and design equitable engagement plans, CCP met weekly over zoom with UCLA researchers for eight weeks (90 min per meeting) in Summer 2020 to identify barriers to trial participation. Members were compensated for their time commensurate with the expected time commitment, both during and outside the scheduled meetings, and were offered a tablet with free internet access if needed for CCP participation. Before the first meeting, each participant received a clinical trial briefing booklet with information on COVID-19, clinical trial stages and processes, the importance of diverse participation in research, and the protection of human subjects. These and other materials were also made available to participants on a website, which was regularly updated with evolving information.
Weekly CCP meetings aimed to promote bidirectional exchange on trial processes, COVID-19, vaccines, and other topics determined by the CCP. The academic team (principal site investigators, clinical trial staff, and CERP staff) developed and shared brief educational presentations about COVID, vaccine development, regulatory approval, emergency authorization processes, and vaccine risk, benefits, and safety. Discussions were framed around community concerns related to trial participation, strategies for clear and culturally appropriate recruitment messaging, and trial participation barriers of high-risk groups. Discussions were driven by new information about the virus, vaccines, trials, and other topics determined by the CCP. Supplemental Table 1 provides a brief outline of the educational objectives of each session and the discussion topics covered during the CCP meeting. For some of the sessions, representatives from a marketing and communications firm hired by two of the local clinical trials participated and had an opportunity to interact directly with community members on language and design of outreach materials, approach, and potential outlets for messaging. The meetings were recorded, and an academic team member took notes during each session.
Clinical trial investigators reviewed the CCP feedback, discussed the feasibility of suggestions with the CCP, and identified strategies to incorporate proposed recommendations
https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2022.471 Published online by Cambridge University Press

when possible. For these analyses, we summarize the recommendations from the CCP and whether and how the recommendations were acted upon.
After the last session, CCP participants were invited to complete a survey that included demographic characteristics, previous research or consulting experience, perceived experience as a community consultant, the perceived value of the community-academic team16, and how they used and disseminated information gained through the CCP. A five-point Likert scale was used to gauge the success of each metric. Cross-collaboration across COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial leads in Los Angeles County
In addition to the CCP meetings, the three participating interdisciplinary vaccine trial teams met in weekly 60-minute Zoom sessions to share experiences. Investigators used these meetings to share approaches to recruitment and engagement, help answer questions raised during the CCP meetings, and incorporate feedback from the CCP with the vaccine trial research teams. Results
The final community panel included 13 participants (Table 1). Participants identified themselves as Black (31%), Latino (39%), Asian (15%), or White (15%). Participants selfidentified as representing the following community sectors and special populations: community health workers (54%), essential workers (46%), health care professionals (31%), low-income (69%), individuals with chronic conditions (39%), and LGBTQ (23%). Most participants had experience serving on a community advisory board (69%). All the participants reported gaining new information about clinical trials, COVID-19, and/or the COVID-19 vaccine due to CCP participation. All thirteen participants reported applying the new information they learned in the community, including sharing the information with family (85%), friends (77%), co-workers (92%), and others (8%). The vast majority, 92%, reported that they felt welcomed as a member of the CCP, and 92% felt that the academic team valued their comments (Table 1). Actionable Strategies Incorporated into Local COVID-19 Vaccine Trials
Clinical trial investigators could incorporate several proposed recommendations (Table 2). The recommendations addressed three domains. First, the participants recommended increasing trust and transparency in the research process by clarifying vaccine science or trial processes, utilization of trusted messages and messengers, and highlighting trial participation
https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2022.471 Published online by Cambridge University Press

benefits in addition to risks. The second group of suggestions related to the importance of inclusive community-engaged approaches to promote more effective outreach and recruitment, developing culturally tailored approaches for engagement, and recruitment communications that promote inclusion, including engagement strategies for responding to questions, concerns, misinformation, and disinformation prevalent in the community. Third, the CCP strongly endorsed enhancing trial accessibility and acceptability related to the social determinants of health, including improving local practices that promote a welcoming environment and address the needs of low-income individuals with competing financial and social demands and study protocols. They specifically recommended strategies to reduce barriers to participation, such as providing transportation services, language translation services for visits and all study documents, offering child care services, and addressing concerns about access to medical visits for vaccine-related side-effects for those who lack health care coverage. CCP members specifically endorsed the importance of creating a welcoming study environment through intentional 'customer service' efforts to improve trust, acceptability, and retention of underrepresented populations in research. The panel recommended that participants receive access to food and refreshments, accommodations for additional instruction, and a clear plan for visits and follow-up to address health literacy, language translation services, and recognition for their participation and time. Lastly, participants recommended clinical trial sites be located directly in the community to improve accessibility and reduce social burden.
Discussions allowed for the iterative development of locally tailored strategies to modify engagement practices related to outreach, recruitment, and retention. During these discussions, the panelists identified individuals, agencies, organizations, media outlets, and community members they viewed as trusted messengers, provided introductions to key stakeholders in the community, and helped craft messages for trial information and dissemination. To enhance transparency, the team shared information on NIH and industry funding for the trials in Los Angeles County and links to websites with that information. Structured discussions were held on trial protocols for each vaccine ("clinical trial basics"), participant expectations related to the timing of procedures, vaccine types, risks such as side effects and the potential for lack of efficacy, as well as the potential benefits of participation, including compensation, early access to promising vaccines, and medical screenings.
https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2022.471 Published online by Cambridge University Press

The panelists and the study teams developed, tested, and customized messaging for different communities in Los Angeles County to improve recruitment. Investigators and panelists collaborated on 112 community discussions for organizations represented by the CCP members, including churches, Filipino social clubs, LGBTQ podcasts, and parent organizations, reaching over 10,000 individuals. Due to the pandemic, many of these events occurred virtually.
Tailoring of the recruitment messaging incorporated readability, inclusive language, diversity in images of participants represented, and updating frequently asked questions in response to trial and vaccine development progress, changes in the pandemic, and CDC and local public health guidance. For example, initial drafts of clinical trial recruitment materials listed eligibility criteria indicating the need for "documentation" of a negative COVID-19 test. The CCP noted the word "documentation" was a potential trigger for deterring undocumented persons or families with mixed documentation status from participation due to the burden of proof and misconceptions participation in public benefits (access to free COVID-19 test) can interfere with future immigration eligibility, also known as fear of public charge.17,18 Ensuring undocumented populations felt safe in clinical trial enrollment was particularly important to the CCP, considering it was unknown at that time if COVID-19 vaccines would only be covered by health insurance.
To improve accessibility and acceptability for trial participation, participants suggested ways to reduce participation barriers related to social determinants of health and suggested improving trial retention through a genuine focus on the participant. Social barriers were mitigated by providing transportation for participants (both for routine visits and "sick day visits," e.g., visits to the clinical trial site to address symptoms that might represent infection or side effects related to the vaccine), Spanish translation services, and referrals to resources for those who were uninsured or underinsured. Although most of the participating clinical trial sites had a strong record of collaboration with diverse communities, the extensive 'customer service' recommendations from the CCP were important reminders of the need to build rapport with participants to enhance retention. Recommendations included a welcoming environment for participants, many of whom had never participated in a clinical trial yet were now doing so in the context of COVID-19 distancing requirements and other restrictions, increased personal and community stressors, and competing clinical and social demands brought about by the pandemic. Specific recommendations included thanking participants for their time, providing clear
https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2022.471 Published online by Cambridge University Press

directions before their appointment, a tour and introductions, asking about gender pronouns, and supplying water, snacks, or a "goodie bag."
The local clinical trials could not address some CCP recommendations. For example, participants strongly endorsed the need for more clinical trial locations in minority communities through mobile trial sites and partnerships with minority services institutions. However, most vaccine trial sites were identified based on prior NIH accreditation, and available mobile vans could not process the clinical trial samples. Other suggestions, such as a need for after-hours availability, including weekends and weeknights, and on-site child care, were not feasible due to union, staffing, or resource limitations. Finally, some panelists' inadequate staff diversity at some sites and lack of fluency in languages other than English and Spanish were major concerns, particularly for representatives of Asian and Pacific Islander communities. Panelists and clinical research teams endorsed the need for lay health workers from these communities who could facilitate participation in the participant's preferred language, study materials (including consent forms and informational materials), and staff and/or translators who could address these participants' needs in real-time. Recruitment of Diverse Communities in the Local COVID-19 Vaccine Trial
Deploying several of the CCP's recommendations for trial engagement, recruitment, messaging, accessibility, and acceptability, our three local trials reported more than 50% underrepresented minority participation, with the following ranges: 32%-47% Latino, 20%-31% White, 11%-21% Black/African American, 5%-21% Asian American, 2% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 1%-4% American Indian/Alaska Native, and 0.5%-5% Other/Multiracial). The racial and ethnic breakdown of local COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial enrollment closely mirrored the racial and ethnic composition of Los Angeles County (Figure 1) and showed larger proportions of racial and ethnic minorities than the aggregate Moderna and AstraZeneca trial enrollments.19,20 Discussion
The disparities in COVID-19 and mortality rates in communities of color represent longstanding systemic health inequities.21,22 Underrepresentation of minorities in COVID-19 clinical trials may result in limited generalizability of outcomes and decreased vaccine confidence and uptake among communities most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

to improve racial and ethnic diversity in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. We found that in addition to leveraging dedicated resources to help vulnerable communities overcome barriers related to the social determinants of health, engagement is critical for reaching diverse participant pools, building trust and transparency, and reducing obstacles to participation. Others have also advocated for the implementation of strategies leveraging community partnered research,5 such as partnering with Black church leaders and other trusted community leaders,23 and acknowledging the role of racism and history of systematic abuse and mistreatment both in health care and medical research for racial and ethnic minorities in the United States.24
The DCE approach to COVID-19 vaccine trial recruitment presented an opportunity to understand and reduce community participation barriers, address informational needs, and improve acceptability. Some suggestions put forth by the CCP were adopted through modifications to each clinical trial team's recruitment approach. Although we could not incorporate all CCP recommendations, the diverse panelists, investigators, and staff allowed for robust discussions of the policies and practices needed to effect long-term, fundamental change in the planning for and implementation of clinical trials in non-traditional settings to engage more diverse participant populations.
Our project had some limitations. This process relied on longstanding community ties and may be difficult to replicate. The rapid implementation timeline also required significant funding to support the DCE approach, staff trained in community engagement, and adequate compensation for CCP participants, given the demands on their time and the need for a quick turnaround for feedback. This study took place in a racially and ethnically diverse urban setting with access to several recruitment sites, so it may not generalize to other locations. Finally, many CCP members had prior experience with research and were highly educated. The perspectives of the members of the CCP may not represent the community at large or those with less favorable views of research; however, we intentionally recruited community leaders with experience working with high-risk communities and racially and ethnically diverse community members to inform our approach. While recruiting diverse participants in clinical trials is essential, future research should focus on retention strategies for participants from underrepresented groups in under-resourced communities.
Our results have important policy implications. High-risk communities should be involved in clinical trial planning to address the profound health disparities during the COVID-

19 pandemic. An established community partner network, organizational infrastructure, and leadership that supports this process allowed us to leverage trusted relationships from a vast network of community stakeholders. The panelists were able to effectively collaborate with clinical trial leadership and staff to provide insight and practical advice on community concerns, share updated and valuable information for their communities, and enhance researchers' awareness of unique barriers and facilitators to participation in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials from the perspective of diverse local communities. To promote the generalizability of clinical trial outcomes and address the needs of populations at the highest risk for health inequities, policies are needed to enhance representation in the biomedical workforce, promote collaborations with trusted community members and organizations, and develop and monitor metrics for diversity in clinical trials beyond race/ethnicity, age, and gender (i.e., socioeconomic status, insurance status, sexual identity and orientation, languages spoken, language preferences). Such policies will build confidence, engage community stakeholders early in the clinical trial process, and overcome social disparities that contribute to health inequities. Ensuring ample funding for community investment and capacity building to create mutually beneficial and reciprocal relationships between researchers and communities is essential to improve the representation of diverse communities in clinical trials.

Self-Isolation and Testing Behaviour During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Agent-Based Model

Umberto Gostoli*
University of Glasgow MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit umberto.gostoli@glasgow.ac.uk

Abstract Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, various models of virus spread have been proposed. While most of these models focused on the replication of the interaction processes through which the virus is passed on from infected agents to susceptible ones, less effort has been devoted to the process through which agents modify their behaviour as they adapt to the risks posed by the pandemic. Understanding the way agents respond to COVID-19 spread is important, as this behavioural response affects the dynamics of virus spread by modifying interaction patterns. In this article, we present an agent-based model that includes a behavioural module determining agent testing and isolation propensity in order to understand the role of various behavioural parameters in the spread of COVID-19.

1 Introduction
Following its appearance in late 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus or COVID-19 has become the most significant global pandemic since the 1918 influenza pandemic. By 15 March 2022 the World Health Organization recorded over 456 million confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide, and over 6.04 million deaths (https://covid19.who.int/). Excess mortality estimates place the global death toll between January 2020 and December 2021 at 18.2 million (Wang et al., 2022). The scale and severity of this global crisis, and the subsequent need for severe public health restrictions to be implemented worldwide, has generated significant interest in using agent-based models (ABMs) to simulate the spread of the pandemic and its effects.
ABMs enable modellers to examine the impact of individual behaviour on population-level outcomes, and in the context of the global pandemic, this approach has been used to examine how individual behaviour influences the capacity for various interventions to reduce the spread of COVID-19. For example, Rajabi et al. (2021) have investigated the impact of social distancing restrictions and travel restrictions on COVID-19 spread; Koehler et al. (2021) have developed an ABM designed to assist policy-makers in making decisions on lifting pandemic restrictions; and Almagor and Picascia (2020) have investigated the efficacy of contact-tracing apps in containing the spread of the virus. While the use of ABMs has proliferated during the COVID-19 crisis, the question of how ABMs can be used most effectively remains a focus of significant debate: See, for

example, Dignum (2021), the subsequent review (Chattoe-Brown, 2021), and numerous comments at https://rofasss.org/tag/jasss-covid19-thread/.
Building simulation models of the pandemic and its effects requires an understanding of human behavioural responses to the spread of the virus in their community. Born et al.'s 2021 empirical study indicates that people do respond to the risk imposed by a pandemic by reducing their mobility. Using data from Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports (https://www.google .com/covid19/mobility/) for Sweden (a country where compulsory lockdowns have not been imposed), this work shows that the mobility of the population decreased considerably during the first wave of the pandemic, although significantly less than in countries where lockdown policies were implemented. Other empirical studies shed some light on the factors affecting self-isolation and adherence to lockdown policies. Smith et al. (2020), in their study of factors associated with self-isolation in the United Kingdom, found evidence that self-isolation increases with increased worry about COVID-19 and increased perceived likelihood of catching the virus. Moreover, they found that self-isolation is affected by the perceived social norm and by the help received from someone outside the household. Pullano et al. (2020) found that, in France the reduced mobility after the lockdown was positively associated with the number of hospitalizations (which can be thought of as a proxy for the risk posed by the virus) and the socioeconomic conditions. Similarly, A. L. Wright et al. (2020), investigating the level of compliance with shelter-in-place policies in the United States, found that compliance with the policy increases with local income.
However, despite the widespread use of agent-based modelling, relatively few COVID-19 models have examined the impact of behavioural factors on how individuals respond to the risks posed by the pandemic. Instead, much of the extant modelling work is highly abstracted, and uses very simplified behavioural models. For example, Wilder et al. (2020) proposed an agent-based model in which out-of-household contacts are based simply on a country-specific contact matrix containing the mean number of daily contacts agents of an age group have with agents from each of the other age groups. Similarly, Silva et al. (2020) presented a model that allows agents to have differential exposure to risk according to their economic status, but does not include a facility for agents to modify their behaviour in accordance with their own perception of risk.
One of the first works accounting for the adaption of the behaviour of individuals during a pandemic was Epstein et al. (2008). Here, agents could be independently infected by the virus and by the fear of the virus. If infected by fear, agents self-isolate at a certain rate, until they recover from fear, ending their self-isolation. Shastry et al. (2022) have recently made progress in this area of COVID-19 modelling research by including a model of risk tolerance in an agent-based simulation of COVID-19 spread. In this model, agents have individual levels of risk tolerance, which is a decreasing function of age, and is adjusted towards the mean risk tolerance of groups with which they interact. The model focused on a U.S. policy context in which shelter-in-place orders were issued but were not legally enforceable; this meant that agents were able to freely defy the restrictions, if their risk tolerance allowed.
In this article, we present an agent-based model of COVID-19 spread that builds upon these foundations and includes a nuanced model of self-isolation behaviour. This behavioural module enables a feedback process, in which pandemic dynamics influence agent behaviour, which then influences pandemic dynamics in turn. The central contribution of this model is a behavioural module that allows households to reduce their social interaction as a response to the perceived risks posed by the virus; these risk perceptions are influenced by public information provided about the virus, the prevalence of COVID-19 infections within an agent's network of neighbours, and the tendency for their neighbours to self-isolate.
While the current model is a proof-of-concept, we propose that simulations including these behavioural elements may help policy-makers to design more effective interventions during future global health crises, including future waves of COVID-19 variants or other novel pathogens. Non-pharmaceutical interventions require compliance from the population in order to be maximally effective, and a deeper understanding of how public information and social context influence compliance may enable the development of more effective messaging.

2 General Framework

The simulation unfolds in two stages: In the first stage a demographic process proceeds in one-year steps, from year 1860 to year 2020, to create a population whose demographic and socioeconomic characteristics roughly replicate those of the U.K. population. In the second stage, the COVID-19 spread is simulated through one-day steps, starting at the beginning of the year 2020 for 360 days. In this article, we provide a brief summary of the demographic module, and refer the reader to Gostoli and Silverman (2019, 2020), Noble et al. (2012), and Silverman et al. (2013) for more details about this module (while the complete Python 2.7 source code for the simulation is available in our GitHub repository at https://github.com/UmbertoGostoli/Pandemic-Behaviour-Model/tree /Pandemic-Only-Sim).
We will describe in detail the novel modules introduced in this article, which are:
r the agent's social network;
r the virus exposure settings and processes;
r the behavioural module (defining isolation and testing behaviour); and
r the course of the virus.

2.1 Demographic Process This stage begins with the generation of an initial population of couples, which are randomly distributed on a 8 ×12-cell grid approximating the geography of the United Kingdom. Each cell of the grid represents a town, and within each town a number of houses is created proportional to the U.K. population density. Each year, a series of demographic events drive the population's dynamics: births, marriages, divorces, and deaths. Empirical population data (in the form of U.K. Census data) is integrated into the model's demographic processes in 1951.

2.1.1 Agent Life Course With a certain age-specific probability the couple's female will give birth. Agents enter adulthood at the working age of 16: At this point they can either start working or continue in education, a choice that is repeated at two-year intervals, until the age of 24.1 After education, agents become employed, taking a salary that is a function of the education level they have reached (which is a stochastic function of their parents' socioeconomic status; see section 2.1.4). When agents reach retirement age (set at 65 in these simulations), they retire from employment. Mortality rates in the model follow Noble et al. (2012) and use a Gompertz-Makeham mortality model until 1951. From that point we use mortality rates drawn from the Human Mortality Database (https://www .mortality.org/). Lee-Carter projections generate agent mortality rates from 2009.

2.1.2 Partnership Formation and Dissolution Once they reach working age, agents can form partnerships. Agents are paired randomly with probabilities that depend inversely on their age, geographical distance from one another, and socioeconomic differences. Age-specific annual divorce probabilities determine whether a couple dissolves their partnership in each year.

2.1.3 Internal Migration Relocation happens most frequently due to agents finding a partner in a different town. Male agents relocate to new houses once a partnership dissolves, and any children produced by that partnership stay with the mother. Retired agents with care needs may move in with one of their adult children,
1 These two-year intervals represent educational stages corresponding roughly to U.K. education levels: A-level, Higher National Diploma, Degree, and Higher Degree.

with a probability determined by their care need level and the amount of care supply in their child's household. Orphaned children are adopted by a household in their kinship network, or by a random family if there are no available households in their kinship network. Apart from these specific, event-driven cases, households also relocate to another town with a certain probability that is inversely proportional to the relative cost of relocation, defined as the ratio between the total cost of relocation and the households' per capita income.
2.1.4 Socioeconomic Status and Income Agents are placed in one of five socioeconomic status (SES) groups, based on the Approximated Social Grade from the Office for National Statistics (https://www.ukgeographics.co.uk/blog/social -grade-a-b-c1-c2-d-e). The model contains a social mobility process: An agent is assigned the SES group associated with the education level the agent has reached, with a probability of moving further up the education ladder depending on the household income and parental level of education. The introduction of SES groups has a number of effects on the various stages of the agent life course: A higher SES is associated with lower mortality and fertility rates, higher hourly salaries, and higher salary growth rate.
Every employed agent receives an hourly salary that is a function of the agent's SES and cumulative work experience. On the basis of the total income of the household's members, each household is assigned an income quintile, which affects a range of processes during the pandemic stage, such as the size of social networks, the probabilities to visit certain venues, the isolation propensities, and the probabilities to develop different conditions (see the next section for details).
2.1.5 Social Networks Each agent is associated with a social network whose size is proportional to the total number of daily contacts associated with the agent's age and SES. These networks are created by randomly sampling agents from the population, and for each sampled agent, selecting a friend from the population with a probability that is proportional to:

- geographical distance, - age difference, - socioeconomic status' distance, and - number of common friends.

Once a link is created between two agents, the probability of the link creation becomes the weight of that link, defining the importance of the relationship between the two agents. Formally, the weight of a connection, wij, is given by:

wij = 1

en

where n is the sum of 4 elements: a function f of (a) the geographical distance, d; (b) the age difference, a; (c) the socioeconomic status' distance, s; and (d) the number of common friends, g. Formally, the four elements are given by the following equations:

f (d ) = d  dd

f (a) = a  aa

Figure 1. Social network parameters.

where the four 's and the four 's are parameters of the model. A summary of the parameters, together with their range and value used in the simulations presented in this article, is shown in Figure 1.
The process is repeated until, for each agent, a social network of the desired size has been created. These personal networks are associated with the networks connecting the households. Each household H is associated with:

- the households of the relatives of household H's members; and - the households of the friends of household H's members.

The weights of the links between households are a function of the geographical distance between the households' towns.
The two networks have different roles in the information processing module through which agent behaviour is determined. While the personal friends network affects agent self-isolation propensity, after this has been formed at a first, individual, level, through agent tendency to adjust behaviour towards the mean of the network, the households network affects the formation of individual self-isolation propensity itself, by allowing agents to observe the occurrence of pandemic events and, therefore, providing them with the information they use to develop their subjective probabilities of these events.

2.2 The Interaction Processes In the second stage, the COVID-19 spread is simulated from year 2020 for a period 360 days, through one-day time steps. We assume that, initially, the virus is brought into the U.K. from abroad by international travellers, a process that we will call exogenous infection. Then, the virus spreads within the U.K. by means of two main spreading mechanisms: social interaction and within-household interaction. We assume that the social interaction process depends on a household's decisions to isolate. After the incubation period, the infected individuals develop various conditions and, at the end of the infection period, either recover or die, as shown in Figure 2.

2.2.1 Exogenous Infections In each period, a fixed share e (which is a parameter of the model) of the adult, susceptible population is infected exogeneously, i.e., through contacts they have with people from abroad. We assume that the probability of being part of this group, which can be thought as composed of international travellers, depends on an agent's socioeconomic status and the dimensions of the town they come from. Formally, the number of people becoming exposed through international travel, Et, in each period is given by:

Et = eS

where S is the number of susceptible agents. Then Et agents are randomly sampled from the population of susceptible adults with probabilities proportional to the product of the functions of two agent-specific factors: a factor that depends on the agent's socioeconomic status, c, and the relative size of the agent's town (in terms of number of houses, t), where:

f (c) = eec

(7)

and f (t) = t (8)
T

where T is the total number of houses, while e is a parameter of the model.

2.2.2 Domestic Interaction Domestic interaction infection is, together with infection through social interaction, part of the endogenous spread of the virus. We assume that the probability that a susceptible agent is infected by a member of its household is an increasing function of the number of infected household members and depends on knowledge of the infection (we assume that if an agent is knowingly infected, the household members will adopt prudential behaviour reducing the probability of transmission). More precisely, each agent is assigned a viral load, v, when it is exposed (randomly drawn from a uniform distribution), and we define the household's infection risk factor, r, as the ratio between the sum of the infected household members' viral loads and a function of the total number of infected agents. Formally:

r=

H i=1

vidh

(9)

Hh

where dh is a dummy variable taking the value of 1 for agents who are unknowingly infectious and a value of h < 1 for agents who are knowingly infectious (the assumption being that if a household member is knowingly infectious, the other members will adopt a prudential behaviour re-
ducing the probability of this agent transmitting the virus). H is the total number of household's
members, and h is a parameter of the model. The probability that an agent is infected within the domestic setting, ph, is given by:

ph = 1 - exp-hr

(10)

where h is a parameter of the model.

2.2.3 Social Interaction In our model, social interaction takes place in a series of venues the agents attend. At the beginning of the pandemic stage, a number of venues is created in each town proportional to the town's population. In each day, we allocate agents to the venues in their town in a way that is consistent with the age-specific interaction matrix for the U.K., as estimated by Prem et al. (2017). Moreover, we assume that a certain percentage of agents visits other towns in each period, to account for daily intra-urban commuting.
Starting from empty venues, agents are sequentially allocated to venues in their town, with a probability that depends on:
r the geographical distance between an agent's house and the location of venues;
r the difference between the mean of the socioeconomic status of venue attendants and the socioeconomic status of the agents to be allocated (the assumption being that the choice of venues is partly driven by socioeconomic affinity); and
r the isolation rate of the agent.

In particular, the probability that an agent i is selected as an attendant of a venue j, is proportional to a factor qv given by:

qv = exp1v (11)

where v is a parameter of the model and  is given by:

 = sc s + dd d

(12)

where c is the difference between the agent's socioeconomic status and the mean of the socioeconomic status of the venue attendants, d is the distance between the agent's house and the venue, and the two 's and the two 's are four parameters of the model. Venues attendants are sampled randomly from the population, so in each period, an agent can visit more than one venue.
The probability of a susceptible agent attending a venue being infected is proportional to the number of infected agents attending that venue. More specifically, the number of contacts s of each attending agent is determined by:

s = Pv

(13)

where P is the total number of venue attendants and v is a parameter of the model (bounded between 0 and 1). Then, a set of P agents is randomly sampled from the set of venue attendants. The probability of an agent being infected by each of these sampled agents, ps, is given by:

ps = sv

(14)

where v is the viral load of the sampled agent (which is 0 if the agent is not infectious) and s is a parameter of the model. A table of the parameters of the exposure processes is shown in Figure 2.

2.3 The Behavioural Module During the pandemic, the number of people attending venues decreases as people become aware that interaction with other people carries a risk of them getting the virus and, as a consequence,

they self-isolate. We assume that agent self-isolation rate is the result of an individual assessment of the risks and of social processes happening through their social network and their household membership.
As for the first, the individual element, the behavioral framework we introduce in this work is based on two cognitive processes: The first is the process through which agents discount probabilistic gains (and losses); the second is the process through which agents estimate probabilities of negative events. The two cognitive processes interact to determine the individually-determined agent self-isolation rate: First, agents estimate the probabilities of being infected and, if infected, of developing various conditions (i.e., being hospitalized, being intubated, or dying); then, with these probabilities agents compute the expected cost of unrestricted movement (which can be also considered the expected gain of self-isolation). We will consider the two modules in turn.

2.3.1 Expected Cost of Infection Green et al. (1999) propose a hyperbolic function with two parameters to describe the discounted value of probabilistic gains (and losses), V. The function takes the following form:
V = C (15) (1 + h )s

with 1-pf
= pf

where p f is the probability of infection when an agent does not isolate, and C represents the expected cost associated with infection, given by:

C = Vh + Vv + Vd

(16)

where Vh, Vv, and Vd represent the value of the expected cost associated with, respectively, hospitalization, intensive care, and death (for simplicity, we assume that symptoms are not associated
with a cost unless one of these three events occurs).
Each of these cost components is itself the value of a probabilistic cost, as it depends on the cost of the generic event e (either, hospitalization, intubation, or death) and the probability of the occurrence of that event (conditional on having been infected), pe. Therefore, it will be determined
according to the equation:

Ve = Ce

(17)

(1 + h )s

with = 1 - pe pe

Ce is the cost of the generic event e (in case it happens). We set the cost of intubation equal to a multiple k of the cost of hospitalization and the cost of death as a multiple k of the cost of intubation (with k being a parameter greater than 1).
Agent subjective probabilities are determined by taking into account, sequentially:
r the publicly available information and r the direct observation of COVID-19 events (within the agent's social network)

Figure 3. Isolation and testing behaviour flowchart.

Then, with these probabilities, the expected cost of infection is calculated, and from this, the individually-determined isolation rate. The final isolation rate is the result of an incremental adjustment of this individually-determined isolation rate through the effect of the social pressure acting upon each agent, i.e., the individually-determined rates of the agents' social network and household members.
The flowchart of the behavioural determination of the agent isolation rate is shown in Figure 3.

2.3.2 Probabilities Estimation
In order to compute the expected cost of infection V, the relevant probabilities are the probability of infection, p f; and, if infected, the probability of being hospitalized ph, of being intubated pv, and dying pd.
From a normative point of view, decision theory dictates that when given alternative choices, individuals should select the alternative with the greatest expected benefit, given by the sum of the products between the probability of the choice's outcome and the value individuals attach to that outcome (Pratt et al., 1995). Harris et al. (2009), however, found experimental evidence that probabilities and outcomes are not independent: Severe events are usually associated with a higher occurrence probability than "neutral" events. Moreover, they showed that this relationship is mediated by the extent to which the occurrence of the event is controllable by the agents. W. F. Wright

and Bower's (1992) study, on the other hand, suggests a possible causal link between the severity of outcomes and the estimation of their probability, by showing that the subjective probability of events is affected by an individual's mood: Happy subjects overestimate the likelihood of positive events and underestimate that of negative events; sad subjects display the opposite tendencies, overestimating bad and underestimating good events. On the basis of these studies, we can argue that the higher the severity of a negative event, the stronger the effect of its occurrence will be on an individual's negative mood and, therefore, the stronger an agent's overestimation of the probability of its occurrence.
Taking stock of these empirical studies, we developed a model of the cognitive mechanism through which agents estimate the probabilities of the pandemic events (infection, hospitalization, intubation, and death). As for the three conditions (hospitalization, intubation, and death), we assume that the empirical probabilities of developing them by age group are publicly known, as they result from empirical studies. However, we assume that an agent's subjective perception of these probabilities diverges from the true (i.e., empirical) values, as agents process information from two other sources that they can observe in each period: the total number of events within an agent's age group, and the events an agent can directly observe within their household's social network. As for the former, the general idea is that agents adjust their subjective probability incrementally towards a value that is a biased measure of the empirical probability. Formally, the subjective probability of the event e in the current period, pet, is given by:

pet = pet-1 + ( pew - pet-1)

(18)

where  is a parameter of the model bounded between 0 and 1, determining how fast the subjec-
tive probability adapts to the new public information. In turn, the biased measure of the empirical probability, pew, is given by:

pew = p + (1 - p)(1 - e-E)

(19)

where p is the empirical, unbiased, probability of the event e, E is the number of new events in the agent's age group relatively to the agent's age group size, and  is a parameter of the model
determining the strength of the bias, i.e., the agent's sensitivity to the public information regarding new cases (for  = 0, pew = p; for   , pew = 1).
The second element affecting an agent's subjective probabilities is the information coming from
their household's network. We assume that agents can observe the pandemic events (infection,
hospitalization, intubation, and death) as they affect a member of a household belonging to their
household's network. Following Epstein (2014), we model the effect of these events on probabilities
by means of a simplified version of the Recorla-Wagner model (Recorla & Wagner, 1972): Each time
an agent observes an event within their household's network, the probability of that event increases by a certain amount. Formally, being pit the subjective probability before the event observation, the subjective probability after the observation of the event, peto , is given by:

peto

where q is a function of the geographical distance d between the town of the observing agent and the town of the observed agent (the assumption being that cases that are closer to the agent will have a higher effect on its subjective probabilities). Formally:

q = ed

As for z, it is a function of the difference between the agent's age and the age of the agent whose case has been observed. Calling g this difference, z is given by:

ee g

z e = ee g + 1

(22)

where e is a parameter of the model. The value of z is bounded between 0, if the difference is a large negative number (i.e., the age of the agent whose case has been observed is much higher than the age of the observing agent), and 1, if the difference is a large positive number (i.e., the age of the agent whose case has been observed is much lower than the age of the observing agent). The assumption here is that the lower the age of the observed agent is compared to the age of the observing agent, the greater the effect will be on the subjective probability of the latter.
On the other hand, if in a certain period the agent does not observe any event, the probability for that event will decrease according to the equation:

peto = pete-

(23)

where  represents the rate at which the occurrence probability of an event decreases as time goes by without the agent observing that event.
With regards to the probability of infection, the cognitive process is similar to the one described for the conditions. There are two important differences. First, differently from the probabilities of developing conditions, there is not an empirically established probability of infection, as it depends on a variety of factors besides the intrinsic infectiousness of the virus, such as the number of people who are around to pass the virus. While this probability cannot be but a very uncertain and subjective estimate, we can assume that it is somewhat associated with the virus' speed of circulation, approximated by the relative number of new infections in the agent's town (that is, the total infections in town divided by the town population). Formally, we define a speed of circulation index, f, defined by the equation:

f = 1 - e-E

(24)

where E represents the relative number of infections in the agent's town. The speed of circulation index is bounded between 0, if E = 0, to a maximum (for E = 1), which depends on the param-
eter . The subjective probability of infection for the period, ptf, is given by the marginal addition to the
previous probability of infection of a fraction  of the difference between f and the previous prob-
ability of infection, where  is a parameter defining the probability's adjustment speed. Formally:

ptf = pt-f 1 + ( f - pt-f 1)

(25)

The second difference concerns the weight through which the agent's subjective probability is updated after the observation of an event within the agent's social network (in this case, an infection) and, in particular, z : While before it was a function of the difference between ages, in this case it is a function of the difference between the observed agent isolation rate and the observing agent isolation rate s. The assumption is that the greater the difference between the isolation rate of the infected agent and the isolation rate of the observing agent, the more the latter will revise its subjective probability of infection upwards. Formally:

e f s

z f = e f s + 1

(26)

where f is a parameter of the model.

2.3.3 Self-Isolation Behaviour
This individually determined cost, Vi, determines both the individual self-isolation propensity, ri and the agent's propensity to get tested for COVID-19.
Agents that do not take a test, or whose test result is negative, self-isolate with a certain probability si. The determination of the agent self-isolation rate, is a four-stage process. In the first stage, the agent individual self-isolation propensity, ri, is determined through the equation:

ri = 1 - e-IiVi

(27)

where Ii is the agent's income quintile (from 1, the poorest, to 5, the wealthiest), the assumption being that income has a positive effect on the agent's capacity and availability to self-isolate, while  is a parameter of the model. Vi is the value of the expected cost, determined in Equation 1. At this stage, we don't have the empirical data to validate the form of Equation 27: It has been chosen conveniently to ensure that the self-isolation propensity takes values starting from 0 (if at least one between income and expected cost if zero), and approaching 1 as income and expected cost increase. The income quintile appears in this equation because of the assumption, based on empirical evidence, that the likelihood of isolation increases with income level.
After the individual stage, in the second stage, the individual self-isolation attitude is affected by the social environment that agents are part of, for the effect of agent conformity to implicit social norms. First, we assume that the agent self-isolation behaviour is affected by the weighted average of the self-isolation propensities of the agent' friends, mi. Formally:

n j=1

rjedij

mi = n edij

(28)

j=1

where n is the number of friends in the agent i 's social network. The weight dij is the weight associated with the link between agent i and the agent's friend j, which is multiplied by a parameter .
According to this equation, the stronger the link between an agent and a friend, the more weight
the self-isolation propensity of this friend will have on the agent's self-isolation, with the parameter
 determining how fast this social influence decreases as the link's strength decreases. Then, the socially affected self-isolation propensity rin is equal to the individual self-isolation
propensity, ri, plus a share of the difference between ri and the weighted social network mean self-isolation propensity, mi. Formally:

rin = ri + (mi - ri)

(29)

where  represents the agent sensitivity to social norms, a parameter that can take values between 1 (if agents conform perfectly to the mean self-isolation propensity of their friends) and 0 (if agents are not influenced by their friends).
Second, agent self-isolation propensity is adjusted at the household level. In particular, we assume, in line with empirical evidence, that households that can count on the help of other households, can more easily self-isolate, while the reverse is true for households that must care for other households. We assume that help is transferred between households linked by kin relationships. Formally, each household is associated with a help availability index, qi, which is determined by the equation:

n j=1

Aije-dij

qi =

n e-dij

(30)

j=1

where n is the number of households with a kin relationship with household i and dij is the weight of household j 's contribution, represented by the kinship distance between household i and the

12

Artificial Life Volume 29, Number 1

U. Gostoli and E. Silverman

ABM of Self-Isolation and Testing Behaviour During COVID-19

related household j (weight that is multiplied by a parameter ). Aij is the difference between the mean ages of household i and household j. Therefore, households with a positive qi (i.e., with a higher mean age than the average of the related households) will receive help and, therefore, adjust their mean self-isolation propensity upwards. Oppositely, households with a negative qi (i.e., with a lower mean age than the average of the related households) will provide help and will adjust their mean self-isolation propensity downwards.
According to this equation, the more distant is the kinship relationship between two households, the smaller weight the help that could potentially be transferred between the two households will have on their self-isolation propensity, with the parameter  determining how fast the influence of the potential help provision decreases as the kinship distance increases.
Formally, calling b0 the mean isolation propensity of a household before the help provision, the household mean isolation propensity after the help provision, b, will be given by:

b = b0 + (rmax - b0)(1 - e-q1 ) if qi > 0

(31)

b0 - b0(1 - eq1 )

if qi < 0

where rmax is the maximum individual self-isolation propensity within the household, which is the self-isolation propensity unconstrained by income considerations, given by Equation 11 setting the income quintile Ii to the highest level. The parameter  represents the sensitivity of the household's mean self-isolation propensity to its help availability index.
Finally, individual self-isolation rate si is determined by adjusting the agent's self-isolation propensity ri towards their household's mean propensity isolation, apart from members who tested positive to the virus, which maintain a complete self-isolation regime. Formally:

si = ri + (b - ri)

(32)

where b is the mean self-isolation propensity of agent i 's household and  is a parameter between 0 and 1.
The agent isolation rate is then used in the social interaction process to determine venue attendants. For each venue, after the pool of people who would normally attend is determined, each agent in the pool is removed with a probability equal to the agent's self-isolation rate. The parameters of the process determining the self-isolation rate are shown in Figure 4.

2.3.4 Testing Behaviour In each period, agents take a test with a certain probability ptest, which is a function of the agent's social preferences  (i.e., a measure of how much they care about not transmitting the virus to others, which is a random value drawn from the uniform distribution at their birth), the agent's income quintile I (the assumption being that agents will be more likely to take the test the more able they are to self-isolate after a positive result, an ability that is a positively related to their income level), and the agent's expected cost of infection, w. Formally:

ptest = 1 - e-TIw

(33)

where T is a parameter of the model.
As for the agent's expected cost of infection, w, it is given by the product between the likelihood
that the agent has been infected, pf (please note that it is different from the probability of infection, p f ), and the value of the cost of being infected, Vi (determined in Equation 1). Formally:

w = p fVi

Figure 4. Self-isolation rate parameters.

In turn, the likelihood that the agent has been infected, p f depends on three variables: the severity of the agent's symptoms (if any); the presence in the household of an infected agent; the probability of having being exposed in a social setting, being a function of the agent's isolation rate si and of the agent's probability of infection, pf, according to the following equation:

p f = (N + H)S

(35)

where N represents the probability of having being infected during a social interaction, H the probability of having being infected through the agent's interactions with other members of its own household, and S is a factor taking values between 0 and 1, determined by the maximum value between a function of the agent's symptoms s, and the probability of being asymptomatic, pa. Formally:

S = max(sT , pa)

(36)

where T is a parameter of the model. As for N, it is given by:

N = 1 - e-TT

(37)

where T is a parameter of the model and T is the n-period mean (with n being the average duration of infection) of the product between agent isolation rate, si, and the subjective probability of infection, pf, for each period in the last n periods. Finally, H is given by:

where hT represents the number of infected household members and T is a parameter of the model. The parameters of the process determining the testing probability are shown in Figure 5.
For agents taking a test, the result can be positive if they have been infected or in the case of a false positive, or the result can be negative if they have not been infected or in the case of a false negative. In any case, if the test result is positive, they self-isolate completely, and take a new test after a fixed number of days that is a parameter of the model.
2.4 The Course of the Virus The flowchart for the course of the virus is shown in Figure 6. Susceptible agents can become exposed through an exogenous process (for international travelers), or through interaction with other members of their household, or interaction with other agents they meet in their social activities.
Once an agent has become exposed, it is assigned one infection course over four possible courses: asymptomatic; symptomatic not hospitalized; hospitalized not in intensive care; in intensive care. In accordance with empirical studies, we assume that the probability of developing more serious conditions grows with age, decreases with social status, and is higher for males than for females (Abate et al., 2020; Brazeau et al., 2020; Ferguson et al., 2020; Guilmoto, 2020; Public Health of England, 2020; Verity et al., 2020; Yanez et al., 2020).

Upon exposure, the agent is also assigned an incubation period, which, in line with empirical observations (Lauer et al., 2020; McAloon et al., 2020), is drawn from a log-normal distribution with a mean of about 5 days, and a recovery period, whose length depends on the severity level assigned to the agent, in order to reproduce a log-normal distribution of the recovery period with a mean of about 12 days at the population level. The exposed agent is also assigned a viral load, which is drawn from a standard uniform distribution. The agent's viral load determines its contagiousness.
After the incubation period, the agent starts to develop symptoms (if not asymptomatic) and, in line with empirical observations (He et al., 2020), we assume that the exposed agent becomes infectious 2 days before the emergence of symptoms. The severity of symptoms of not-hospitalized symptomatic agents is differentiated by assigning them a symptoms severity index, between 0 and 1 exclusive, with the probability of the agent being assigned a higher value increasing with its viral load and its age, decreasing with its income quintile, and being higher for males than for females. The closer to 1 the symptoms severity index, the more severe the symptoms are, and the greater the reduction of the agent's mobility. Therefore, the agent's mobility is given by the minimum between the illness-affected mobility and the mobility resulting from the behaviourally determined isolation rate of its household. Finally, the agent's symptoms severity index determines the probability that the agent will take a test.
After the recovery period, a share of agents die, with a probability that also depends on age, social class, and gender. All other agents recover and we assume that they are immune to COVID-19 thereafter.
3 Simulation Results
In this section, we present the results of a benchmark simulation repeated 20 times (the black lines representing the average, and the green bands around it, the standard deviations).2 In Figure 7 we show the share of susceptible agents in the population. Contrarily to the usual logistic curve of the traditional susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, where the number of susceptible agents decreases quite fast in the central period of the pandemic, we can see here that the number of susceptible agents decreases quite slowly, with almost 65% of agents still susceptible after 360 days.
Correspondingly, the number of infections, shown in Figure 8, grows relatively quickly until its peak, after around 60 days, to slowly decrease thereafter.

Figure 9. Number of new cases.

A similar dynamics follows the number of new cases and hospitalizations, shown respectively in Figure 9 and Figure 10. The number of cases increases quite quickly to its peak after around 60 days, to decrease quite slowly from that point, through a series of irregular fluctuations.
Figure 11 shows the total attendances (i.e., the sum of all agents attending venues in a given day), whose dynamics is the result of the self-isolation generated by the behavioural model proposed in this article. We can see that agent self-isolation propensity increases up to the peak of the pandemic, where attendances are about 20% lower than the pre-pandemic figure. After the peak, attendances tend to recover but at a relatively slow pace, in line with the decrease of cases.
In the next three figures, we show how the pandemic has different outcomes depending on the agent's income quintile. Empirical studies have found conflicting evidence about the relationship between socioeconomic status and outcome severity. While some studies have found a positive relationship (Hawkins et al., 2020), other studies failed to find a clear relationship (Ingraham et al., 2021; Khan et al., 2021; Little et al., 2021). Our simulations confirm the complexity of the relationship between socioeconomic status and COVID-19 infections and outcomes. While the number of infections increases with the income quintiles (Figure 12), as we look at outcomes of increasing severity, the income quintiles that are most affected tend to move towards the lowest one: The

central quintiles are those with the highest number of hospitalizations (Figure 13) and the second quintile is that with the highest number of intubations (Figure 14). Note that in our model we do not consider the effect of comorbidity, which may account for a large part of the relationship between socioeconomic status and COVID-19 outcomes: These differences among income quintiles, therefore, are only the effect of the interaction among the different demographic structures, social interaction, and behavioural differences in the interaction patterns of agents belonging to different income levels.
Finally, Figure 15 shows the out-degree distribution of the infection network, where the degree represents the number of infected individuals by each contagious agent. We can see that the relationship between the frequency of degrees and the degrees on the log-log scale is approximately linear, (the R2 being -0.97), with a scaling parameter of around 2.5, a typical value of scale-free networks. The fact that the model reproduces a scale-free infections network is rather surprising if we consider that from a behavioural point of view all the agents have a similar behaviour (apart from "linear" differences related to their age and socioeconomic status). Note that in the real world, the so called super-spreaders, are likely to infect more than 12-13 agents. However, we have to consider

that this result is highly dependent on the size of the population, which, because of computational constraints, we scaled down by a factor of 1 to 5,000.

3.1 Sensitivity Analysis Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to estimate the effect of a set of six parameters on the simulation's output. As the aim of this article is to introduce a behavioural model of self-isolation, the outcome we focus on is the total number of attendances during the pandemic: the lower this number, the higher the degree of self-isolation, on average. As for the choice of the parameters, we focused on six crucial processes of the complex behavioural model proposed, as described below:

- , in Equation 27, determining the degree to which agent self-isolation propensity is sensitive to agent income level I and the value of the estimated cost V;
- , in Equation 24, determining the sensitivity of the agent's subjective estimate of the probability of infection to the relative number of new infections in the agent's town;
- , in Equation 19, determining the effect of the relative number of new hospitalizations, intubations, and deaths on the agent's subjective estimate of the related probabilities;
- , in Equation 29, determining the effect of social norms on the agent self-isolation propensity;
- , in Equation 31, determining the effect of the availability of the kinship network's help on the household's mean self-isolation propensity; and
- , in Equation 23, which is the fear of extinction rate.

From the sensitivity analysis we can see that within our theoretical framework, the parameter that most affects the degree of self-isolation is , the parameter determining the effect of the relative number of new infections in the agent's town on the agent's estimate of the probability of infection. (See Table 1.) The second most important parameter is , determining the effect of the product between the income level and the value of the expected cost of infection V. We can notice that V depends on the probability of infection, whose value depends on . However, because of Equation 3, the leverage of  happens to be greater than that of . The third most important parameter is the fear of extinction rate.

On the other hand, the other three parameters have a much smaller effect. The most important parameter among these three is , which regulates the effect of a kinship network's help on a household's mean self-isolation, whereas the effect of the social norms and, especially, of the relative number of the various conditions (i.e., new hospitalizations, intubations, or deaths) is quite negligible. This last result is quite surprising if we consider that the relative number of new infections has the largest effect on the outcome. The reason is that public information is only one of the determinants of the subjective probabilities of events: These probabilities are also affected by the events that agents observe (or, do not observe) in each period within their household's network. Since the three events of hospitalization, intubation, and death are relatively rare for a large part of the population, the fear of extinction process is predominant over the effect of public information.

4 Conclusions
In this article we demonstrate a proof-of-concept model that simulates interactions among the behavioural adaptations of agents to the COVID-19 pandemic and the course of the pandemic itself. Our behavioural model allows households to reduce their social interactions due to their perceived risks of infection, which provides a first step towards the development of more policy-relevant agent-based models of COVID-19 and future pandemics. The results show that the propensity of agents to self-isolate in the presence of risk has a pronounced effect on the course of the pandemic, which is reflective of real-world outcomes.
We propose that this model can provide a basis for further exploration of behavioural responses to pandemics and their impact on disease transmission. The simulation also allows for the more detailed investigation of inequities in COVID-19 outcomes between different socioeconomic status groups. Future iterations of this model can examine additional health behaviours adopted in response to COVID-19, such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and vaccines, in order to further explore the behavioural responses to the wide variety of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions used during the pandemic.

Introduction: A key aspect of the public health response to COVID-19 in Scotland was enhanced community surveillance, including testing in dental settings. Across Scotland, dental settings offered patients over 5-years-old the opportunity to participate in community surveillance of COVID-19. Methods: A Health Inequalities Impact Assessment (HIIA) was conducted to understand the differential impacts the programme would have on the population and to improve the accessibility of the programme. HIIA is a tool to allow the assessment, understanding, and mitigation of impacts on people of a proposed policy or practice. It fulfils an organisational duty to meet the requirements of the Equality Act and Fairer Scotland Duty. The HIIA was conducted rapidly in parallel with the programme development. An action research approach included an online workshop, consultation, review of population data and a literature search. Results: Adjustments were required to improve the programme's accessibility. Stakeholders, including dental teams from across Scotland were involved in the consultation and brought their front-line experience in different settings. Common issues identified included digital literacy and access, language and cultural barriers to participation, and issues relating to the implications of a positive COVID-19 result. Literature indicated limited evidence on the acceptability, accessibility, and equity of asymptomatic COVID-19 surveillance. Conclusion: This HIIA was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. As an example of good practice in tackling inequalities in access to programmes it should represent the benchmark for other similar initiatives.

Introduction
Understanding how COVID-19 affected different groups in the population was a key aspect of the public health response and was crucial for informing public health measures and policy decisions. Public Health Scotland led this work under the banner of Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 in Scotland (ESoCiS) (Health Protection Scotland, 2020a). The work included data streams from community, secondary care, schools and also dental settings. Each stream aimed to gather evidence about prevalence, routes of transmission and symptoms.
The COVID-19 Surveillance of Asymptomatic Patients in Dental Settings programme provided SARS-CoV-2 testing to patients screened as asymptomatic attending dental appointments from 3/8/20-1/4/21. Testing was initially offered to both children and adults attending Urgent Dental Care Centres (UDCCs) where the programme was active. Methods and early results are described by Conway et al. (2021). The programme was expanded to include general dental practices and hospital dental services. At the time of conducting this HIIA only UDCCs were involved (Health Protection Scotland, 2020a,b).
In Scotland, public bodies are required to demonstrate that the organisation has fulfilled the legal duty of the

Equality Act 2010 when carrying out its obligations (UK Government, 2010). The Fairer Scotland Duty goes further by asking public bodies to `pay due regard' to activity that could lead to inequalities (Scottish Government, 2018). The equivalent legislation in Wales, the Socio-Economic Duty, was enacted in March 2021, England abides by the Equality Act with no further primary legislation akin to the Fairer Scotland Duty (Welsh Government, 2021; The Equality Trust, 2019).
Tools are available to help public bodies understand the impact of their activity. An Equality Impact Assessment (EQIA) will help an organisation demonstrate that it has met the duties set out in the Equality Act. However, a Health Inequalities Impact Assessment (HIIA) provides a broader scope for inclusion of more people beyond the defined protected characteristics by considering other issues such as income, culture, social factors, employment and human rights (Public Health Scotland, 2021). An HIIA will therefore enable a public body to meet the duties of both the Equality Act and the Fairer Scotland Duty by highlighting inequalities and allowing mitigating action to be taken.
To the best of authors' knowledge there are no peer reviewed published articles of an HIIA related to testing for SARS-CoV-2 or for any other type of asymptomatic testing.

There were two aims of this project. First, to assess and understand the impact of the COVID-19 Enhanced Surveillance in Dental Settings programme on an individual's ability to participate in the programme. Second, to mitigate potential negative impacts where possible by carrying out a HIIA and implementing recommended changes as the programme developed during the pandemic.
Method
An HIIA is ideally carried out in the planning stages of a programme, where changes and adaptations can be easily incorporated. Due to the rapid nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and need to mobilise the programme, this HIIA was conducted alongside the development and implementation of the programme, with real time changes.
The objectives agreed for the HIIA were to: · Explore current literature assessing acceptability
and accessibility of similar testing programmes. · Gather views from a range of stakeholders to
understand impact. · Identify negative impacts and recommend pos-
sible mitigations. · Assess what adjustments were needed to ensure
the programme was as accessible as possible and explore options for tailoring of the programme towards vulnerable groups. Methodology outlined by Public Health Scotland (2021a) informed the approach but was adapted to consider remote working and the inability to hold workshops face to face. The online workshops using Microsoft TEAMS and an online consultation process are described below.
Population Eligible for Testing
Children and adults attending UDCCs where COVID-19 Enhanced Surveillance testing was offered were considered in the scope of the HIIA. The HIIA focussed on people with protected characteristics and other vulnerable groups but made recommendations on a population basis. The programme evolved to include patients in other dental settings and the findings were expected to remain relevant as UDCCs provided care to members of the general population.
Rapid literature and data review
National datasets were consulted to understand the demographics of the general population (National Records of Scotland, 2020a, National Records of Scotland, 2020b, Scottish Government, 2021a, Scottish Government, 2021b, and Scottish Government, 2020a). Service level data from NHS Fife were compared with national datasets to estimate how comparable the population accessing urgent dental care were to the general population. The data are not reported in detail in this paper as they were based on local unpublished service level data.
A rapid literature search was undertaken (search strategy available on request).
Scoping workshop
The workshop was planned by a small working group, held over Microsoft Teams and lasted 60 minutes. The objectives of the session were to:
2

· Review the existing literature and datasets. · Consider the impact of the programme on the
following characteristics: age, disability, pregnancy and maternity, homelessness, involvement in the criminal justice system, socio-economic deprivation, living in remote and rural locations, religion and belief, sexual orientation, looked after children and young people, carers, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, addictions and substance misuse, and healthcare staff. · Identify what further information should be gathered to help deliver the programme effectively. Members of the programme Steering Group and those involved in the two programme pilot sites (NHS Fife and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde) were invited to the workshop.
Consultation
To widen participation in the HIIA, consultation used an online questionnaire with the following groups; dental teams involved in delivery of the programme across all 14 NHS Scotland Territorial Health Boards; patients who had participated in the programme; patients who had not participated in the programme; and patient advocacy/ representative groups (with support from the NHS Fife Equalities team).
An online questionnaire was developed following the scoping workshop. The Microsoft Forms platform hosted the questionnaire and was circulated via mailing lists. Cascading of the questionnaire to other staff members and patients was encouraged. The questionnaire was live for two weeks in October 2020.
Results
Comparison of local and national data
The demographic characteristics of the samples taken during the pilot phase of the programme were compared against local and national data to indicate its reach. National estimates used data sources such as the census, and local data were based on unpublished service level data (Scottish Government, 2021a). There was greater representation of individuals from the most deprived Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) quintiles seen in the UDCC sites, with a good spread of involvement across the population gradient. Gender was approximately equally split and ethnicity as recorded was consistent with population estimates. There was over representation of working age adults, and under representation of children and older adults, which is indicative of the population who access emergency dental care.
Rapid literature review findings
The literature search related to acceptability, accessibility, equity and equality in testing for COVID-19 produced limited results with most papers related to swabbing for other diseases such as HIV or influenza (Demmer et al., 2020; Goyal et al., 2017; Balán et al., 2017; Knight et al., 2017). The available literature concluded that selfswabs carried out for COVID-19 were well tolerated and viable. Opinion pieces by experts presented arguments for ensuring equitable testing systems and a will to do so (Dodd and Ibidun, 2020; Kernberg et al., 2020).

Evidence from other diseases such as HIV concluded that; offering mouth swabs increased the uptake of testing compared to blood tests in young people; home testing by the user was generally favourable; an oral swab was more acceptable to the participants than a blood test; including further testing of the blood for other sexually transmitted infections led to increased acceptability. A paper related to influenza found that patients assessed collection of nasal swabs to be acceptable either by selfswab or carried out by healthcare workers.
The search produced a low quantity and low-quality evidence base. Literature related to acceptability, accessibility, equity and equality in testing for COVID-19 was limited based on the search criteria at time of the search. The international evidence base appeared to be limited in this field. Feasibility of carrying out asymptomatic testing in a dental setting has previously been proven in a pilot study focused on investigating Human Papilloma Virus infection (Conway et al., 2016). The study also reported that it was possible to recruit a sample that would be representative of the Scottish Population.
Consultation participants
In total, 35 dental team members from across Scotland participated in the consultation. These were from twelve of fourteen Health Boards. Table 1 summarises the respondents by team role. Eleven patients responded to the questionnaire, but no responses were relevant to the aims of the HIIA.

Protected Characteristics
No specific barriers or implications were noted either through the consultation or scoping workshop for characteristics of sex, pregnancy and maternity, marital status, sexual orientation and religion or belief.
Children and young people were under-represented in the UDCC setting and in the surveillance programme. Children are a small proportion of the patients seen for emergency dental care and prioritisation of care over participation in the surveillance programme was often reported. There were potential impacts not just on the child being tested, but also their family due to the need for isolation, therefore it was felt that some parents refused consent out of fear of the implications of a positive test result.

Several potential impacts were noted for those living with a disability, focusing on communication, consent and co-operation for the test. There was recognition that the role of an escort or family support was vital in providing high quality care to those with disabilities which could affect understanding, communication or indeed physical access to the dental clinics. Other barriers included digital exclusion for this group and difficulties in communication when faced with staff wearing PPE.
The options for recording gender on the participant questionnaire and UK Government portal where test kits were registered presented binary options as this was linked to NHS health records. This was not an inclusive way for gender to be recorded. Whilst the programme recognised this, due to the need to link to records it was difficult to change. The programme raised this issue with the providers of the portal resulting in the option to not declare gender being added.
To allow individuals from all ethnic backgrounds to participate in the programme it was felt that patient facing materials must be available in multiple languages with interpretation on site if required to address possible language barriers. The patient materials were translated into the top five community languages (Polish, Arabic, Urdu, Romanian and Mandarin) and further translations were available on request.
There were no specific cultural issues identified regarding the uptake of testing, however certain ethnicities were disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and its impacts and this may have been a barrier to testing for this group (National Records of Scotland, 2020b). Asylum seekers and refugees may be reluctant to participate in a programme such as this, especially if the testing pathway is through the UK Government portal.
Other characteristics of interest
Impacts on staff involved in the programme included increased workload, additional time required for patient appointments and additional responsibilities. There were mixed reactions, which broadly correlated to the wider feelings about testing. Those who expressed that they felt the programme was a positive initiative were more likely to frame these impacts in a positive manner and have a sense of ownership over the programme. Those who felt the programme was inappropriate or not beneficial were more likely to view staff impacts negatively.
Having a representative population involved in the surveillance programme was important, therefore specific attention was required to ensure coverage across remote, rural and island locations. The programme was able to reach across Scotland and had good coverage in most locations, including the islands. Other groups which may otherwise have struggled to access this type of testing were those experiencing homelessness and those involved in the criminal justice system. The Public Dental Service is the main provider of dental care for these individuals and therefore the programme could be extended to this population. However, it was noted that the implications of self-isolation for these individuals may have been more difficult to manage via existing pathways. Similar considerations were made for those with substance misuse and addictions issues, who may have been less likely to access care, and if they had accessed care, refusal to participate in asymptomatic testing was expected to have been higher.

Health Inequalities
The Steering Group identified several possible impacts on the causes of health inequalities. Many of these were centred around the impact of a positive test result on a household. It was therefore reasonable to assume that the potential negative impacts may have driven refusal to participate in the programme from those most at risk of these impacts, resulting in an unequal population representation in the data. Impacts were noted in ability to attend work, exclusion from education and recreation beyond the home, accessing healthcare being more difficult in the short term and an individual being excluded from social events for the isolation period. Some of these impacts may be mitigated through the support that was available in the Test and Protect system and Local Authority support measures.
Data from the 20-week report indicated that the programme was able to reach an even spread of participants across SIMD quintiles as shown in Table 2 (Public Health Scotland, 2021b). The decision to site the programme in UDCCs initially may be an explanation for this, as the need for urgent care is higher in lower socio-economic groups, therefore providing greater opportunity to participate for these individuals. This contrasts with routine, nonemergency care, where a socio-economic gradient would be more likely to occur (Public Health Scotland, 2021c).

Human Rights
The scoping workshop did not identify significant impacts of the programme on human rights. Participation was voluntary, and dental treatment should not have been affected by an individual's decision to participate. The consultation broadly reflected this viewpoint. A small number of comments suggested that the implications of a positive COVID-19 test result could temporarily have restricted an individual's right to freedom, due to selfisolation, however these issues were not unique to the surveillance programme.
Summary of the impact of the HIIA
The programme achieved equal representation across SIMD quintiles and an equal gender split. There was some skew in the age profile due to a lower proportion of children accessing emergency dental care in the UDCC's. Ethnicity was well recorded (high completion rate) and showed an approximate split in line with population estimates.
In total 13 recommendations across the domains of acceptability, accessibility and availability were provided
4

following the HIIA scoping workshop and consultation. Of the 13 recommendations, 11 were acted upon and solutions delivered (Table 3). The remaining two were not possible within the time and resources available.
Discussion
The HIIA, and particularly the consultation, was carried out at pace and delivered in an online format only. Professional engagement across the programme was a strength of this project considering the short timescales involved and the methods of online engagement proved effective for this group. It was easy to disseminate, through email lists and onward cascade to interested parties.
However, limitations of the assessment were acknowledged:
· The literature search strategy was basic and not systematic as the aim was to spark workshop activity rather than comprehensively review literature. It could be refined and expanded to bring together the evidence surrounding accessibility, acceptability and equity associated with testing for SARS-CoV-2.
· There was limited public involvement in the consultation; therefore, the output broadly represents the views of professionals and the available evidence base. Although not directly part of the HIIA, a local quality improvement project ran in tandem and sought the views of the public and patients (Wemyss et al., 2022). The focus of that engagement was on understanding reasons for refusal to participate and findings were reported to the national steering group. It is essential, where possible, that the public viewpoint and lived experience of individuals are incorporated into impact assessments. This is a limitation of the HIIA, driven by the pace and available consultation methods at the time during a pandemic.
· Further consideration of the impact of an online platform for engaging the public should include issues with digital exclusion and literacy. Reports available on the Public Health Scotland website record difficulties engaging a wide range of patients or patient groups prior to the pandemic in more traditional ways (NHS Health Scotland, 2013a; NHS Health Scotland, 2013b). It is likely therefore that a variety of options for the public to engage will be more inclusive and might include a mix of face to face conversations, targeted use of social media, patient group websites, online focus group events and engaging patient advocacy groups.
Despite some limitations, this HIIA proved to be a useful tool toward deeper consideration of the impact of decisions on population groups and resulted in a series of recommendations to mitigate negative impact on health inequalities.
In conclusion, it is possible to carry out an HIIA at pace in the middle of a pandemic to produce results that can positively shape delivery of surveillance programmes. Broad consideration of the potential impacts on individuals and communities is encouraged through the HIIA process. The HIIA provided a valuable assessment of potential issues for accessibility, availability and

Article submitted on 17 Jun 2021 / accepted on 21 Jan 2022 / published on 28 Apr 2022

Background: The start of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign among French healthcare and welfare sector workers in January 2021 offered an opportunity to study psychological antecedents of vaccination in this group. Aim: We explored whether knowledge and attitude items related to social conformism and confidence in systems contributed to explaining intention for COVID19 vaccination. Methods: We developed a knowledge and attitude questionnaire with 30 items related to five established and two hypothetical psychological antecedents of vaccination (KA-7C). The online questionnaire was distributed from 18 December 2020 to 1 February 2021 through chain-referral via professional networks, yielding a convenience sample. We used multivariable logistic regression to explore the associations of individual and grouped KA-7C items with COVID-19 vaccine intention. Results: Among 5,234 participants, the vaccine intention model fit (pseudo R-squared values) increased slightly but significantly from 0.62 to 0.65 when adding social conformism and confidence in systems items. Intention to vaccinate was associated with the majority opinion among family and friends (OR: 11.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.51-29.67) and a positive perception of employer's encouragement to get vaccinated (vs negative; OR: 6.41; 95% CI: 3.36-12.22). The strongest association of a knowledge item was identifying the statement `Some stages of vaccine development (testing) have been skipped because of the epidemic emergency.' as

false (OR: 2.36; 95% CI: 1.73-3.22). Conclusion: The results suggest that social conformism and confidence in systems are distinct antecedents of vaccination among healthcare and welfare workers, which should be taken into account in vaccine promotion.
Introduction
Vaccination is one of the main tools to respond to the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are among the priority groups in most countries who aim to provide them with protection given their continuous exposure, protect the healthcare system from absenteeism and prevent nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. In France, COVID-19 vaccination of HCWs has been recommended from early January 2021 on, initially limited to those aged 50 years or older or with underlying conditions, and without any limitations from early February 2021 on.
In July 2021, the COVID-19 vaccination coverage for at least one dose among HCWs in France was estimated at 60.5% and 80.5% in nursing homes and in private practices, respectively [2]. At the same time, a strong gradient of the vaccination rates from medical professions to nurses and nurse assistants was described in hospitals, similar to the expressed intentions in surveys performed France in 2020 [3,4].

5C and 7C refer to the five established (5C) and additional two hypothetical antecedents (7C) of vaccination respresented by item group.
vaccine mandate for healthcare and welfare sector workers entered into force in France on 15 September 2021 and includes since 30 January 2022 a booster dose. To prepare a long term strategy of COVID-19 vaccine promotion, it will be important to understand and follow up antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.
The term vaccine hesitancy was coined to describe the attitude of delay in acceptance or refusal towards vaccination despite availability [5]. To better understand the source of vaccine hesitancy and to evaluate interventions to mitigate, it is important to consider the psychological aspects of human behaviour and choice. The original 3C psychological antecedents model [5] included (i) confidence i.e. trust in vaccines, the system that delivers them and motivations of policy makers who decide on needed vaccines; (ii) complacency i.e. need of the vaccine given its effectiveness and severity of the disease; and (iii) convenience i.e. accessibility [5]. Betsch et al. proposed an expanded 5C-scale including two additional antecedents: (i) calculation (deliberation on risks and benefits); and (ii) collective responsibility (sense of altruism towards getting vaccinated) [6]. In our study we explore whether items related to two additional antecedents can improve the explanation of vaccine intention. First, we propose adding social conformism as a psychological antecedent. Taking decisions by imitating peers is known to be an important heuristic that helps to reduce mental load in daily life [7]. In several discrete choice experiments higher theoretical vaccination acceptance was found in scenarios presenting higher coverage in the community [8-10]. Furthermore, we examine whether the confidence psychological antecedent should discriminate between confidence in the vaccine and vaccine-related system and confidence in the wider circle of systems, including authorities and employer. In a study looking at French-speaking general practitioners in late 2020,
2

the distrust in the Ministry of Health and in vaccine safety appeared to lead to lower COVID-19 vaccination acceptance [11]. Additionally, as pointed out by Larson et al., confidence can be separated into product trust, provider trust and political or system trust [12].
The roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination among HCWs in France provided an opportunity to study whether knowledge and attitude items related to social conformism and confidence in systems (authorities and employer) contributed to explaining the intention for COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare and welfare sector workers.
Methods
Participant recruitment
From 18 December 2020 to 1 February 2021, the Research Group for the Prevention of Occupational Infections in Healthcare Workers published an online survey via the Sphinx online survey platform. This was disseminated by email chain-referral throughout France, including overseas departments. Several formal and informal networks of hospital-based and private practice HCWs and of nursing home directors contributed to its dissemination. Since each participant could forward the survey across their own network, we did not estimate a response rate; nor were visits to the survey website counted.
Data collection
The questionnaire consisted of three parts. The first and third part collected socio-demographic, professional and health-related characteristics of the participants, and information on the intention to accept and recommend COVID-19 vaccination. The second part of the survey directed participants, by choosing a shape (square or triangle), to either a discrete choice experiment [13] or to the present questionnaire on knowledge and attitudes. Effective survey completion time was ca 8 min.
Questionnaire development
The knowledge and attitude (KA) questionnaire was based on the 5C-scale for evaluation of psychological antecedents presented by Betsch et al. [5]. Since the 5C-scale relates to vaccination in general, we adapted questions to apply specifically to COVID-19 vaccination of healthcare and welfare sector workers in the epidemic context in France. Item groups related to the two additional antecedents were included in the KA-7C questionnaire: social conformism and confidence in systems (authorities and employer). One author developed a draft of the KA-7C questionnaire which was reviewed by other co-authors for coherence with the 5C-scale. Each item group consisted of at least one attitude and knowledge question. In total, the KA-7C questionnaire had 30 questions: nine questions were associated with the attitude towards the vaccine and systems; 19 questions were associated with the knowledge about the vaccines, their development and

COVID-19. A 5-point Likert scale was used to simplify questionnaire administration. Two items were general attitude questions on confidence in the authorities for managing the public health and economic crisis caused by COVID-19 and concern about the COVID-19 epidemic, both on an 11-point scale (Supplementary Table S1). Knowledge items were either presented as a statement to which participants could answer `Right', `Do not know' or `Wrong', or requested a single choice answer to a question from several options which included `Do not know' (Supplementary Table S1).
Prior to finalisation, the questionnaire was reviewed by occupational health specialists in hospitals who are in charge of vaccine promotion towards HCWs, and pilottested in think-aloud sessions with HCWs including physicians, pharmacists and nurses.
Data analysis
Knowledge variables were coded as incorrect answer, `Do not know' and correct answer. We kept `Do not know' as a distinct modality of the knowledge variables, to distinguish the specific situation of participants recognising their lack of knowledge. Answers to the general attitude questions (i.e on confidence in crisis management and concern about the COVID-19 epidemic) were transformed into three categories: (i) low: 0-3; (ii) medium: 4-6; and (iii) high: 7-10. Other attitude items were maintained on a 5-point scale.
We used bivariate logistic regression models to explore the association of participant characteristics and individual KA-7C items with vaccine intention. Initial analyses explored vaccine intention as `Yes' with and without the 'Do not know' modality. No major differences were detected between these analyses, therefore the final analyses were carried out on the variable 'Yes' vs 'No/ Do not know' to clearly focus on vaccine intention. We created a variable for the different periods of survey

participation: (i) period 1 from 18 December 2020 to 4 January 2021, which was the early phase of the COVID19 vaccination campaign targeting nursing home residents; (ii) period 2 from 5 January to 14 January 2021, when vaccination was expanded to HCWs aged 50 years or older; and (iii) period 3 from 15 January to 1 February 2021, when the COVID-19 vaccination campaign was expanded to the general population aged 75 years or older or to people having specific high-risk comorbidities such as rare immune disorders.
We evaluated collinearity between the KA-7C items using the collin command in Stata version 16.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, United States (US)). For variables with variance inflation factor>2, we conducted pairwise Spearman correlation testing and considered any correlation with rho<0.70 as not critical. To identify socio-demographic and health-related determinants of vaccine intention, we included variables with p value<0.20 in bivariate regression into a multivariable logistic regression model using a stepwise forward procedure (basic model). In France, most professional categories in the healthcare and welfare sector are well-defined and correlate with educational trajectories [14,15]. We therefore did not include educational level in the models.
We examined the contribution of items and item groups to the explanation of vaccine intention variation based on MacFadden pseudo R-squared values (R2) where values above 0.20-0.40 indicate excellent fit. The significance of the contribution of the hypothetical antecedent item groups was assessed based on the nested log likelihood ratio test. Figure 1 presents: a basic model adjusting only for socio-demographic variables; a model with all 30 KA-7C items compared with a model limited to five antecedents (5C); models including only knowledge compared with only attitude items and models with individual C-item groups.
Finally, for presentation of effect estimates, we defined a shortlist of 14 KA-7C items, selecting for each 7C item group the attitude and the knowledge item with the highest pseudo R-squared value. We estimated the association of each KA-7C item and item group with vaccine intention in multivariable models reporting odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). All models controlled for age group, sex, professional category, work in a nursing home and period of study participation.
Results
Participants
The survey reached all French regions, including the overseas departments, although participation in the latter was sporadic. A total of 9,580 participants from diverse health-related careers and sectors participated. The KA-7C questionnaire was completed by 5,234 participants, with similar distribution across the periods defined by roll-out of the vaccination

campaign: 38.7%, 30.9% and 30.4%. Women represented 78.4% of participants and 23.2%, 40.0% and 36.8%, respectively, were aged 18-34 years, 35-49 years and50 years or older (Table). Nurses represented 22.9%, nurse assistants 9.4%, biomedical professionals (including physicians, midwives, pharmacists and biologists) 27.7%, other paramedical staff 15.7% and administration staff 24.4% (Table). Among physicians in our sample, 59% were female and median age group was 35-49 years (cf.d with 50% and 49.3 years mean age according to official estimates in 2021 [16]). Among nurses, 85% were female and median age group was 35-49 years (cf.d with 88% and 40.2 years mean age in 2011 [17]).
Working at least part-time in a nursing home was reported by 805 (15.4%) participants (Table). Threethousand and thirty-four participants (58.1%) indicated vaccine intention against COVID-19, 1,153 (22.0%) indicated no intention, while 1,038 (19.8%) did not know yet. Among participants, 2,779 (53.1%) reported vaccination against influenza during the 2019/20 winter season. The variable on receiving the previous influenza

vaccine in 2019/20 was highly associated with COVID19 vaccine intention but not included in models to avoid overfitting (data not shown).
Exploration of model fit
Compared with a model including the initial 5C item groups, the addition of confidence in systems and social conformism increased the model fit slightly but significantly, from R2=0.62 to 0.65 (p<0.001) (Figure 1). The model with attitude 7C-items only had a substantially higher R2 when compared with the model with knowledge 7C-items only (0.64 vs 0.38).
Model fits (R2), corresponding to the percentage of variation in vaccine intention that can be explained, ranged from 0.17 to 0.51 for individual item groups (Figure 2). Confidence in systems and social conformism showed an R2 of 0.37 and 0.30, respectively.
In a full model that included the shortlist KA-7C items and adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics (Supplementary Table S2 showing results of all KA-7C items), the strongest associations were observed for

a positive attitude regarding the vaccine's benefitrisk balance (strongly agree vs strongly disagree, OR: 16.81; 95% CI: 9.66-29.25), fear of a severe side effect (strongly agree vs strongly disagree, OR: 12.47; 95% CI: 7.80-19.92) and a very favourable majority opinion among family and friends (vs very skeptical, OR: 11.02; 95% CI: 4.19-29.01) (Table, Figure 3). The strongest association with a knowledge item was identifying the statement 'Some stages of vaccine development (testing) have been skipped because of the epidemic emergency.' as being false (OR: 2.36; 95% CI: 1.73-3.22).
Discussion
In this cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of French healthcare and welfare sector workers exploring the psychological antecedents of COVID-19 vaccination, we found that items referring to social conformism and confidence in systems contributed to the explanation of vaccine intention, in addition to the 5C-model previously presented by Betsch et al. [5]. While the additional explanatory effect of including the two additional item groups was significant but relatively small, the effect sizes of corresponding items (opinion in private environment and perception of employer's encouragement) were among the strongest in multivariable analysis.
While the KA-7C questionnaire explained 65% of the variation in vaccine intention, most explanatory power came from attitude items, contrasting with limited contribution from knowledge items. Regarding social conformism, the response to the question about majority opinion on COVID-19 vaccination among colleagues or family and friends was strongly associated with vaccine intention of the individual healthcare and welfare sector worker. Vaccination is a socially influenced process, and given the tendency towards homophily (selfselected association with similar people) [18], those who intend to vaccinate are likely to be in a social network with people who share the same sentiments and vice versa [19]. Our results are in concordance with results of previous discrete choice experiments, where the presentation of higher levels of vaccine coverage in the community was associated with greater theoretical vaccine acceptance among HCWs (seasonal influenza and pertussis vaccines) [9], adolescents (human papilloma virus vaccine) [20] and university students (measles and meningococcal vaccines) [8]. The heuristic concept of imitating-your-peers [7] should be further explored in promotion of COVID-19 and other vaccines towards healthcare and welfare sector workers. Taking into account local cultures and group norms, creating chain effects within social networks should help normalise vaccination. Research on vaccine acceptance should therefore increasingly target specific milieus, professional categories and social networks. Any interventions will require a good understanding of the positive or negative social influences acting within the target group.

During the COVID-19 epidemic, confidence in national authorities has become an important polarising characteristic [19] that affects adherence to epidemic control measures and vaccine intention in populations. We addressed this aspect in two ways, by asking questions about participants' confidence in authorities with regard to COVID-19 crisis management and their perception of a vaccine recommendation from the employer. In France, having previously voted for political parties on the far-left or far-right spectrum, was negatively associated with early COVID-19 vaccine intention in spring 2020 [19]; and a negative perception of healthcare working conditions has been found to be inversely related to influenza vaccine uptake [21]. HCWs play a crucial role at the interface between public health officials and the general population. However, many HCWs are not vaccinology experts and are well aware of how little they know of various vaccines and their inability to answer some of their patients' questions [22]. As stated by Ward et al., the relationship between public health authorities and HCWs in France has deteriorated over the past 30 years along with depleted funding for public hospitals and the restructuring of the health system [23]. Neither change has helped to induce a positive perception of the vaccine-related or wider systems.
In France, only authorities can issue mandates and often mandates are expected from authorities, which explains why vaccination is highly politicised. Vaccine mandates for HCWs, often supported by hospital managers and doctors, can be seen as either the solution or as an aggravating factor to the problem of suboptimal vaccine coverage among HCWs. Primary and booster vaccination against COVID-19 has become mandatory for healthcare and welfare sector workers in France, and contract terminations for non-compliance with the mandate have been reported since October 2021. Further research is needed to evaluate in how far general, not vaccine-related, societal trust should be taken into account as a separate psychological antecedent of acceptance of other recommended vaccines and for the general population.
Knowledge items played a small role in explaining COVID-19 vaccine intention. The healthcare and welfare sector workers in our sample were a heterogeneous group with education ranging from vocational training to over 6 years of medical training. The frequently observed difference in influenza vaccine uptake between professional categories has led to the conclusion that professionals with shorter educational duration need more or better information on vaccines. Previous vaccine promotion campaigns among French HCWs have focused on organising meetings to deliver scientific messages and answer any questions as decision makers tend to think that lack of knowledge might be conducive to vaccine hesitancy [24], However, attitudes may be more important, albeit more challenging to influence. In a previous study looking at the general US population, better knowledge about the vaccine and less acceptance of conspiracy theories were
7

associated with higher COVID-19 vaccine acceptance [25], while education level was not consistently associated with believing vaccine misinformation across different countries [26]. Research in social psychology has provided strong evidence that better knowledge alone does not lead to greater motivation for behavioural change, but that changing attitudes may impact behaviour [27,28]. From a social marketing perspective, information should be presented in a way that positively influences attitudes, for example by informing about high vaccine coverage among the target group in other countries, rather than mentioning local insufficient coverage.
There is a considerable body of evidence on factors that influence COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and uptake among HCWs [29]. Other studies on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance by HCWs in Europe underpin the importance of trust and confidence [30-32]. We found a high overall capacity of this KA-7C questionnaire to explain variation in COVID-19 vaccine intention among healthcare and welfare sector workers. In comparison, socio-demographic differences explained a smaller proportion of variation (14%), which is surprising given the observation that vaccine coverage against influenza and against COVID-19 consistently differs substantially between socio-demographic and professional groups. A separate analysis will address the capacity of the KA-7C questionnaire to explain these variations between professional categories. Further psychometric analysis is required to validate the questionnaire and model structure with social conformism and confidence in systems as psychological antecedents.
Our study has some limitations. First, the study evaluates COVID-19 vaccine intention, but not eventual uptake. A considerable gap between vaccine intention and uptake exists [33], but looking at the factors that influence intention can at least contribute to explaining the thought processes that inform health decision-making as suggested in the Health Belief Model [33], the COM-B model [34] and the Theory of Planned Behaviour [35]. Second, for some knowledge questions we used relatively unspecific words, such as easily and frequently, which may not allow for the exact knowledge to be measured. However, more detailed estimates would probably have been difficult to expect apart from scientist HCWs and for some items (e.g. risk of long COVID-19) no precise estimate was available at the time of the survey. Third, data collection took place at the start of the COVID-19 vaccine campaign in France, during a period of constant communication of new information regarding vaccine efficacy and safety. However, our final model adjusted for the periods of survey participation such that the identified psychological antecedents should be independent of such trends. Finally, our results are limited to healthcare and welfare sector workers in France willing to participate in an online survey, while the relative importance of 7C item groups for COVID-19 vaccine intention may be different among non-participating healthcare and
8

welfare sector workers, other population groups and other countries. Also, while the importance of social conformism and confidence in systems have been described for other vaccinations including influenza and childhood vaccinations, it likely has been exacerbated by the epidemic situation and may be lower in other contexts and with other vaccinations.
Conclusions
Our study provides evidence that social conformism and confidence in systems are distinct psychological antecedents of vaccination and that attitude items play a larger role than knowledge in explaining vaccine intention. It may be worth considering social conformism and confidence in systems for more targeted vaccine promotion, although this would make the task more complex: a more detailed understanding of social influences and of opinions about working conditions and politics among subgroups is required. A first step could be insisting on the fact that vaccine decision among HCWs is a professional question to be addressed by occupational health, apart from private social environment on one side, and political claims on the other.
In January 2022, the COVID-19 vaccination mandate in France was extended to a booster dose. Our findings can help improve COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among French healthcare and welfare sector workers in the perspective of a long-term strategy beyond the mandate, but also in other population groups, for other vaccines and in other countries.

Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV- ) Omicron variant infections in children with congenital heart disease (CHD).

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on SARS-CoV-

Omicron-infected children with CHD who were admitted to Shanghai

Children's Medical Center from April ,

to May ,

. The clinical,

laboratory and imaging data, and the nucleic acid conversion time of the

children in this group were collected and analyzed.

Results: Thirteen patients were included in this study and had an average age of . ( . - ) years. Among the patients, patients were preoperatively treated, and were postoperatively treated. According to the severity of the disease, patient was diagnosed with the moderate type, and the remaining
patients were diagnosed with the mild type. The clinical symptoms were mostly associated with upper respiratory tract infections, including with fever ( %), with cough ( . %), with sputum production ( . %), of shortness of breath ( . %), etc. All patients were successfully discharged from the hospital, with . ± . days needed to obtain cycle threshold (CT) values  in nucleic acid testing and . ± . days of hospitalization.

Conclusions: For vulnerable patients such as children with CHD, SARS-CoV- Omicron variant infections mostly present with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms with negative or mildly changed chest imaging. Through appropriate treatment of the underlying disease in the quarantine ward, patients might obtain good outcomes, even after long periods of hospitalization.

Introduction
As of May 1, 2022, there have been more than 500 million people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 6 million deaths worldwide (1). On November 9, 2021, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1529, was first detected in South Africa, and the World Health Organization (WHO) named it the Omicron variant on November 26, 2021 (2-4). Due to the high transmissibility of the omicron variant, a new wave of global epidemics has occurred over the last several months (5-9). Moreover, a large number of pediatric patients with omicron variant infections were detected (10-12).
In late February 2022, a wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection rapidly appeared in Shanghai as of May 4, 2022, and 601,942 patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infections, including 503 deaths. All the new viral genomes in Shanghai were clustered into the SARS-CoV-2 BA.2.2 sublineage (13). Patients under 18 years old, including several patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), were admitted to the quarantine ward in Shanghai Children's Medical Center affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine during this outbreak in Shanghai. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no reports of Omicron variant infections among the pediatric CHD population. We presented the first single-center case series study of the clinical features of CHD children with Omicron infections.
Materials and methods
From April 1, 2022, to May 31, 2022, in our center, all patients younger than 18 years old who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test by pharyngeal/nasal swab (fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, cycle threshold (CT) cut-off value 43) were reviewed, and patients with CHD were included in this study. The hospital ethics committee approved this study and waived the need for individual consent (SCMCIRB-K2022053-3). During hospitalization, the patients were classified according to the Chinese Health Commission's Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program (Version 9) (14): mild, moderate, and severe. The discharge criteria (14) were as follows: (1) The patients' temperature had normalized for more than 3 days; (2) the respiratory symptoms had improved significantly; (3) chest imaging showed significant improvement; (4) a CT value 35 was noted for the N gene and ORF gene on two consecutive nucleic acid tests (based on the fluorescence quantitative PCR method with a threshold value of 40 and if the sampling interval was >24 h) or negative nucleic acid results on two consecutive tests (based on the fluorescence quantitative

Results
This study reviewed a total of 625 patients admitted to the quarantine ward in our center from April 1, 2022, to May 31, 2022. Finally, 71 patients (11.36%) had pre-existing medical conditions. Thirteen (2.08%) CHD patients were included in this study. Median age was 1.1 (0.16-14) years, and mean weight was 11.03 ± 5.59 kg. None of the children in our study were previously vaccinated. The clinical features of the 13 patients are listed in Table 1.
Among the 13 children with CHD, 3 patients were preoperatively diagnosed: 2 were diagnosed with ventricular septal defects (VSD), and 1 was diagnosed with pulmonary atresia with VSD (PA/VSD). Ten patients were postoperative: 3 patients had VSD, 2 had an atrial septal defect (ASD), 1 had severe mitral regurgitation (MR), 3 had pulmonary artery sling (PAS) with tracheal stenosis, and 1 had tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The time from operation to SARS-CoV-2 infection was 3.5 (0.5-114) months. Details of all 13 patients are shown in Table 2.
According to the severity of the disease, our study included 1 moderate patient and 12 mild patients. The moderate patient (patient 11) underwent VSD surgery 9 years ago. He was admitted to the hospital due to high fever and shortness of breath during this episode. The chest X-ray showed bilateral lung exudation. The patient was given oxygen inhalation with a mask during the first 5 days. Digoxin was used to strengthen the cardiac output, and furosemide was used for diuresis. The patient was successfully discharged after 20 days of hospitalization without the need for mechanical ventilation. Three mild patients (patients 2/4/5) underwent slide tracheoplasty while correcting the cardiac anatomy. These three patients were treated with nebulization and occupational therapy while they were in the quarantine ward to prevent airway obstruction due to excessive secretions. There was a special mild case (patient 3) who unfortunately suffered cardiac arrest after VSD repair and was saved by ECMO in the intensive care unit. Then, a second intervention was performed during ECMO support. Residual moderate tricuspid regurgitation and a 3 mm ASD were reserved. The patient was admitted to the quarantine ward after having been confirmed positive on the nucleic acid test, and the patient had residual anatomical problems. However, beyond our expectations, the patient was quite stable during the hospital stay and did not require any additional treatment.
The results of routine blood tests in the 13 patients admitted to the hospital are shown in Table 1. The results of chest X-ray examination are shown in Table 2. Obvious exudation was detected in only two patients, and mild or no change was detected in the remaining patients. No specific electrocardiographic or echocardiographic changes related to the infection were detected.

The pharyngeal/nasal swab nucleic acid test was an important laboratory test during hospitalization. The basic CT value of the nucleic acid N gene of the patients in this study was 25.09 ± 6.10, and it took 16.4 ± 2.9 days to meet the basic criteria for discharge. The duration of viral clearance was similar between patients infected during the early postoperative period (within 1 month after surgery) and the late postoperative period (15.0 ± 1.7 days vs. 16.7 ± 4.2 days, p = 0.528). The changes in the CT value of the nucleic acid N gene are shown in Figure 1.
All these patients were free of symptoms during the followup period. The three preoperatively diagnosed patients had regular clinic visit and the operations were scheduled in the near future.
Discussion
Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has become the most prevalent variant in the world. Several studies have also found that children have been susceptible to the Omicron variant in the last 6 months (10-12). There is no doubt that children with CHD are a special category in the pediatric population. We reported a series of 13 cases of pediatric patients with Omicron variant infections and congenital heart disease that have not been reported in previous studies. All patients were successfully discharged with no complications.
Since the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, children with CHD have been a vulnerable group for this type of disease. The severity, complications, and mortality of pediatric patients with CHD were higher than those without CHD. In an early study in 2020 (15), 53 CHD patients were reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Ten patients were children (2 moderate-severe cases), and there was a total of 3 (6%) deaths. In a retrospective study by Strah et al. (16) in 2021, a total of 160 cases of CHD pediatric patients were included. The patients with CHD were younger (1 vs. 11 years), had a longer length of stay (22 vs. 6 days), had a higher complication rate (6.9 vs. 1.1%), had higher mortality rates (3.8, 0.8%), and had higher costs ($54,619 vs. 10,731; p < 0.001 for all). Moreover, in a recently published study comparing children with CHD and non-CHD patients, it was found that the pediatric patients with CHD had a higher ICU admission rate (55.6% vs. 31.9%) and higher use of mechanical ventilation (18.5% vs. 6.5%).
As the first study on CHD combined with the omicron variant, there were no severe cases in our study, and all 13 patients were successfully discharged. This might be because the omicron variant was thought to be less severe than the former variants in terms of the disease severity (17). As was first reported regarding the Omicron prevalence in children in South Africa (10), seven (5%) of 138 children were ventilated, and four (3%) died during the study period. All deaths were related to complex underlying diseases. Therefore, CHD, as one of the most common underlying diseases in children, still needs

to be given special attention by clinical staff. In our study, our medical team in the quarantine ward included skilled CHD surgeons, intensive care unit specialists and experienced nurses who were very familiar with the pathophysiology of different types of CHD. Proper management of underlying diseases might be one of the factors that contributed to the successful discharge of all our patients in this study.
At present, the vulnerable factors of Omicron infection in children with CHD are described as follows:
First, the characteristics of the Omicron variant were reported in recent studies (6): due to the extensive spike protein mutation, which plays an essential role in SARSCoV-2 evolution via changes in receptor-binding domain and neutralizing antibody epitope presentation, the omicron variant had high levels of immune evasion and transmissibility. Furthermore, the Omicron receptor-binding domain increased ACE2 (host receptor) binding, which then worsened the SARSCoV-2 transmission and disease severity (18). The properties of these structures have led to the quick spread of Omicron variants around the world.
Another influencing factor was vaccination status. In adult studies, it was found that the 3 doses of vaccine provided a good protective effect against Omicron infection. In a recent study of pediatric patients (19), the estimated vaccine

effectiveness for 2 doses of BNT162b2 against symptomatic infection decreased rapidly (60.1 to 28.9% in children and 59.9 to 16.6% in adolescents), and among adolescents, it increased after a booster dose (71.1%). However, patients with CHD might be younger than non-CHD patients when infected. Due to the current policy, children with symptomatic CHD start getting vaccinated against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 6 months postoperation. They did not receive any sort of SARSCoV-2 vaccine. Therefore, the development of effective and safe vaccines for patients of younger ages and special populations is an urgent problem that needs to be solved.
From the perspective of children with CHD, there were also factors that made them more susceptible to infection than non-CHD patients. For children who are being treated prior to CHD surgery, some studies believe that (20) CHD-induced congestive heart failure (left-to-right shunt) or cyanosis (right-to-left shunt) might lead to chronic inflammatory responses. Moreover, the influence of SARS-CoV2 resulted in further immune activation and failure of some lymphocyte subsets. It requires special attention, as CHD could represent a population particularly at risk during the COVID19 pandemic.
For postoperative children, the whole or part of the thymus needs to be removed during the process to ensure

the surgical field of view since most CHD surgeries require the midsternotomy approach. However, premature removal of the thymus at a young age could also lead to abnormal T-cell differentiation. In a long-term follow-up study (21), thymectomized CHD patients more frequently developed cancer, autoimmune diseases, and atopic diseases and had a higher risk for viral infections (59.5 vs. 19.9%, p < 0.001). In this study, among the 10 postoperative children, all required a midsternotomy approach in cardiac surgery, and the possibility of removal of the thymus during the operation was high, which might be one of the factors why they were more likely to be infected by the Omicron variant. However, with the continuous advancement of surgical techniques, many CHDs can be treated surgically with the minimally invasive operation technique. They can be treated with a subaxillary incision, which could significantly reduce the proportion of surgeryrelated thymectomies.
Another possible factor might be cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Most CHD surgeries still need to be performed with CPB. However, early studies pointed out that the severe systemic inflammatory response caused by CPB (22, 23) often leads to the disturbance of immune function in the short term after surgery. In a case series study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections after cardiac surgery (24), the effect of CPB on the inflammatory system was regarded as a confounding factor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it requires special attention. All the postoperative patients underwent CPB during surgical repair in our study. Perhaps this might be one reason why the patients were infected.
In addition, some of the children with CHD had genetic abnormalities, the most common being Down syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome and Noonan syndrome. These genetic defects were associated with immune deficiencies, which may increase the risk of Omicron infection and the occurrence of severe diseases.
Another finding in our study was that it took a long hospital time (16.4 ± 2.9 days) for CHD patients to improve to meet the discharge standard, which was not reported in previous studies. A longer duration of infection might increase the risk of the patient developing severe disease. Therefore, one question to ask is how can we shorten the required time to reach the adequate CT value to prevent mild cases from developing into severe or critical cases? The baseline CT value in some of our patients was above 35. These patients were in the incubation period or early stages of the disease, and a decreased CT value could be found on Day 7 (Figure 1) in these patients.
Since 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected cardiac surgery to varying degrees (25, 26). The operation time of preoperative patients was delayed. Some children with severe heart diseases lost their indications for surgery and died. In our study, 3 patients were preoperatively enrolled. They were able to meet the discharge criteria at 22, 11, and 14 days. At present, there are several reports on the treatment of critically ill CHD after negative nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 (27) and

surgical treatment in the recovery period for SARS-CoV-2 (28). These studies have a positive effect on exploring the reasonable timing of surgery in children with CHD during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. As clinical staff are working on CHD disease patients, we should increase our attention to this type of research.
Limitations
This study had several limitations. First, our study was a single-center retrospective study with a limited number of samples and a short study time, and was limited by the selection bias. Second, the main criterion for discharge in this study was based on the CT value of the N gene on the nasopharyngeal nucleic acid test. However, in actual work, we found some sampling bias in the CT value results caused by the sampling techniques of nasopharyngeal swabs. Third, the sampling time of the nucleic acid in our study started from the 7th day after admission. We did not conduct nucleic acid sampling within 7 days because of the following reasons: (1) the possibility of children's CT value reaching the discharge standard was extremely low; (2) due to the large number of patients in the ward, it was reasonable to reduce the number of samplings in order to reduce the risk of medical staff being infected. Such a protocol inevitably led to a certain deviation in the nucleic acid CT value curve.
Conclusion
Children with CHD are at risk of infection with the Omicron variant. As the first report in CHD children with Omicron, none of the patients in our study became severe cases, and careful treatment of the underlying diseases might lead to successful discharge. Although the Omicron variant might be less serious, it took a relatively long time to meet the discharge criteria.

Introduction: Sexual and Reproductive Health access to Information services is still a pressing need for youth in Uganda even during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted health care access in many countries. The aim of this study was to explore the challenges in access and utilization of sexual and reproductive health services as faced by youth during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Uganda.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out from 28th April 2020 to 11th May 2020 in Uganda. An online questionnaire was disseminated to youth aged between 18 and 30 years over a period of 14 days. The snowball sampling method was used to recruit participants. STATA version 14.2 was used for statistical analysis.
Results: Of 724 participants, 203 (28%) reported that they did not have access to information and/or education concerning sexual and reproductive health (SRH). More than a quarter of the participants (26.9%, n = 195) reported that testing and treatment services of sexually transmitted infections were not available during the lockdown, and 27.2% could not obtain contraceptive supplies. Access to HIV/AIDS care services and menstrual supplies was also impaired. Lack of transportation was the commonest factor cited as limiting access to SRH services during the lockdown (68.7%), followed by the long distance from home to SRH facilities (55.2%), high cost of services (42.2%) and

the curfew (39.1%). Sexually transmitted infections were the commonest SRH problems related to SRH during the lockdown (40.4%) followed by unwanted pregnancy (32.4%) and sexual abuse (32.4%). Marital, educational, and employment status were significantly correlated with the reported experiences of the participants.
Conclusion: Access to SRH information and services for Ugandan youth was restricted during the COVID-19 lockdown and leaving them vulnerable to various SRH risks and adverse outcomes. Lack of transportation, long distances to health facilities, and high cost of services were important limiting factors. The Government and other stakeholders should incorporate SRH among the priority services to be preserved during future outbreaks.

INTRODUCTION
On 11th March, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic (1). As of 17 October 2021, 99,363,697 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed worldwide with 2,135,959 deaths. That report included 2,489,430 cases and 24,464 deaths in Africa. By that date, Uganda had registered 39,188 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 318 reported deaths (2). Many governments responded to the pandemic by instituting mass quarantine, lockdown, and/or social distancing (3). Uganda announced a lockdown and dawn-to-dusk curfew on 20th March 2020. Subsequently other COVID-19 pandemic control measures were introduced, all of which have severely curtailed access to sexual and reproductive health services with direct and indirect consequences for young people (4).
As quarantines and school closures were put in place to contain the spread of disease in many countries across the world (1, 4, 5), women and adolescent girls became more vulnerable to SRH problems such as coercion, exploitation, sexual abuse, and restricted access to contraception. Delays in the care of pregnant women and an increase in the number of unsafe abortions have also been reported (6, 7). The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in its COVID-19 Pandemic Global Response Plan emphasized that SRH is a significant public health issue that demands urgent and sustained attention and investment (8). Similarly, the Inter-Agency Working Group (IAWG) on reproductive health has also recommended that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services should be maintained (6).
The Government of Uganda issued directives to protect pregnant women's access to maternity services by allowing for transportation of pregnant women seeking care and access to call-in ambulance services provided by the Ministry of Health (7). However, other sexual and reproductive health services were not

a priority during the lockdown, resulting in diminished access to contraceptive and menstrual health supplies, and a reduction in SRH programs for comprehensive sex education, reduction of gender-based violence and support for victims of assault (7). The reallocation of already limited resources to deal with the pandemic and the re-assignment of health care workers from their usual duties limits the capacity to provide other essential SRH services, leading to adverse outcomes of chronic health conditions, disabilities, HIV, and pregnancy (9, 10). Reports are emerging of a rise in gender-based violence, unwanted pregnancy among young girls, unsafe abortion, closure of antenatal care services in some of the public health facilities, and a sharp decline in women and girls seeking SRH services (7). Youthfriendly corners at health facilities that had been established by the Ministry of Health of Uganda and donors to make SRH services more accessible were not available during the lockdown (7).
Uganda has a national adolescent health policy that aims to streamline adolescent health concerns into the national development process to improve youths' quality of life and standard of living (11). Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, SRH services for young people in Uganda were inadequate (12, 13). Studies have identified young people in Uganda and other sub-Saharan African countries as having limited access to contraception, and a lack of staff trained to address the sexual health needs and education gaps of youth. These deficits have negatively impacted upon youth's sexual and reproductive health include sexually transmitted infections (STIs), defilement, rape, substance abuse, and unwanted pregnancies which majority end into unsafe abortions (12, 14). The Uganda demographic health survey of 2016 highlights a 28% unmet family planning need and a prevalence of over 25% teenage pregnancies among sexually active young people by the age of 16 years (15, 16). Unintended pregnancy is common in Uganda with the attendant high levels of unplanned births, unsafe abortions, and maternal injury and death (15, 16).
This study was carried out to explore the challenges faced by youth in accessing and utilizing sexual and reproductive health services during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Uganda, and to inform appropriate

intervention measures to respond to young people's sexual and reproductive health needs during pandemics and other health emergencies.
METHODS
Study Population
The Uganda youth policy defines youth as all young persons, aged 12-30 years (17). This age group includes more than 10 million people, 22.9% of the Ugandan population (18). This study was focused on Ugandan youth of consent age of 18 years and above at the time of the study.
In Uganda, 78% of its population is below 30 years of age (19) and despite relatively high costs of voice and data services, nearly 71% of Ugandans own mobile phones, and the coverage of internet-enabled handsets is increasing (20).
Study Design and Setting
A nationwide cross-sectional online survey was conducted among Ugandan youth from 28th April to 11th May 2020.
Data Collection and Instrument
An online questionnaire was developed from a validated and published study on SRH needs and rights of young people in Uganda (21) and was composed of 22 questions. Six questions were related to socio-demographics (age, sex, marital status, educational level, location, occupation). Twelve questions addressed access to SRH information and services during the COVID-19 lockdown. Two questions dealt with factors that limited access to SRH information and services and two questions asked about SRH problems during the COVID-19 lockdown (Supplementary Table 1). As the study was conducted online, participation in the study required internet access, minimal computer literacy level, and ability to operate WhatsApp, Twitter, or Facebook. To ensure correctness and appropriateness to the local context, the questionnaire was pretested and reviewed by two independent reviewers and piloted in Bushenyi district of western Uganda whose responses were not included in the study.
To calculate the sample size, we hypothesized that at 99% confidence interval at 5% margin of error for a population of 10,326,072 Ugandan youth aged 18-30 years (21), 50% of the respondents would have a challenge related to SRH during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Using the Open-Source Epidemiologic Statistics for Public Health (OpenEpi), v.3.01 (Dean AG, Sullivan KM, Soe MM. OpenEpi: www.OpenEpi.com, updated April 06, 2013), a minimum sample size of 664 respondents was needed in this study. As the country was under lockdown, social media (WhatsApp, Twitter, or Facebook) was used to conduct the survey. A snowball sampling technique was used to pool the initial eligible respondents who were in turn encouraged to recruit more respondents from their acquaintances in different regions of the country by forwarding to them the link to the survey. The questionnaire was administered for a period of 14 days. On receiving and clicking on the link, participants were autodirected to an informed consent. Completion of this page was required in order to proceed to the questionnaire. At the end of

the data collection period, 724 participants had responded to the study tool from the four regions of the country (274 in Central region, 254 in Western region, 122 in Eastern region, and 74 in Northern).
Data Processing and Analysis Plan
Categorical variables were presented using frequencies, and/or figures whereas continuous variables were presented using means, standard deviations (SD). Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to investigate association of socio-demographics with factors that influenced access to SRH as well as the experienced problems in SRH during the COVID-19 lockdown. Results are presented as Crude Prevalence Ratios (CPR) and Adjusted Prevalence Ratios (APR), respectively. We used the Poisson Regression with Robust standard error option, which is appropriate for cross-sectional studies (22). STATA version 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA) was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS
A total of seven hundred thirty-three (733) participants completed the online questionnaire. Nine (9) participants were excluded from the survey because they were above 30 years of age. Responses from seven hundred twenty-four (724) participants were analyzed.
Socio-Demographic Characteristics of Participants
Males represented 56.4% of participants. The mean age was of 24.4 (SD ±2.8) years. The majority (78.0%) of participants were single and 87.2% had attained an educational level of university. Only 27.2% were salaried employees. Most participants were from central Uganda (37.8%) followed by western Ugandan (35.1%) (Table 1).
Access to Sexual and Reproductive Health Services of Participants During the COVID-19 Lockdown
Table 2 shows the reported availability of SRH services to the participants in this study. Out of 724 participants, 203 (28.0%) reported no access to information on SRH. Regarding STI's, 195 participants (26.9%) reported that they did not have access to testing and treatment for STIs while 29.6% participants did not know whether such services and information were available. About a third (27.2%) of participants did not have easy access to their preferred modern method of contraception during the COVID-19 lockdown. Inability to access HIV testing and counseling services was reported by 22% of participants.
Nearly half of the participants (49.3%) reported using family planning methods, the overwhelming majority of which used modern methods (Figure 1). Of the 320 participants using modern contraception, the majority (72.5%) used condoms, 10.3% reported using emergency pills, 6.9% relied on an IUD, 6.2% on an injectable contraceptive, and 4.1% used implants.

Lack of transport was the most commonly reported factor that impaired access to SRH services (43%), followed by distance from home (34.5%), cost of services (26.4%), and curfew (24.4%). Other factors were fear or/negative provider attitude (22.5%), no service provider at the facility (21.3%), school closure (12.3%), and lack of knowledge as to where SRH services could be obtained (Figure 2).
One hundred thirty-six of the participants (18.8%) reported having SRH challenges during the lockdown. Of these, STIs were the commonest problem (40.4%), followed by unwanted pregnancy (32.4%) and sexual abuse (32.4%). Other SRH problems included unsafe abortions (17.7%), pregnancy complications (17.7%), lack of anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) (13.2%), death of a child (5.9%), and obstetrical fistula (5.2%) as shown in Figure 3.
Relationship of Socio-Demographic Status
There was a statistically significant association between marital status and reports of difficulty in accessing SRH information and treatment (p < 0.001, Table 3). Cohabiting people [CPR: 1.3 (1.13-1.49)] were more likely to report limiting factors than single participants. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses indicated statistically significant association of educational status with reports of limiting factors to access to SRH information

Association of Socio-Demographic Factors With the Reported SRH Health Challenges
Prevalence of SRH problems was significantly associated with marital status (p < 0.001, Table 4). People who co-habited [CPR: 2.7 (1.88-3.74) and APR: 2.3 (1.60-3.29)] were more likely to report problems, while single people were least likely. Education level also had a significant associated with, as university educated participants were less likely to report SRH challenges.
DISCUSSION
In response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, Uganda introduced one of the most stringent lockdowns in Africa. The government banned public gatherings, shut down shopping centers, places of worship, schools and entertainment centers, restricted travel, and enacted a night-time curfew (15, 23). Although the travel ban was

partially lifted for pregnant women and people with HIV/AIDS, the government did not address access to other essential SRH services such as contraceptives, menstrual sanitary supplies, and access to treatment for HIV (15, 17).

Many participants in this study reported poor access to SRH during the lockdown. Inadequate access was already a significant problem before the pandemic in Uganda as well as in many other developing countries (12-24). A 2015 study reported a significant

unmet need for SRH services for young people in Wakiso district in Uganda (12). A qualitative study in the Kaborole district found widespread misinformation about contraception and STIs (25). Two major surveys in Uganda found that students, including those engaged in high-risk sexual behaviors, had limited access to SRH services and HIV/AIDS-related programmes (21-26). Despite efforts to improve access to SRH services, a survey of 70 resource poor countries found that <10% of adolescent women had access to health facilities and information about family planning (24). Inadequate access to SRH information and services has also been reported by studies in Kenya, Zambia, and Swaziland (27, 28).
Global health emergencies dictate shifts in priorities that present problems to the availability, accessibility, and affordability of SRH services (17). During previous epidemics and other outbreaks of infectious diseases in the past, poor access to SRH resources has been associated with increased maternal and childhood mortality (17). During West Africa's large multicountry Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak of 2014-2016, increased maternal mortality was attributed to closures of health facilities. Additionally, health care staff were reluctant to provide obstetrical care because infection control measures were

inadequate, and they feared for their own safety (29). A study in Guinea found a decrease of 51% in Family Planning (FP) visits during an Ebola outbreak (30). Economic factors seemed to drive a spike in pregnancy that occurred during an Ebola outbreak in Liberia, as girls reportedly had sex in exchange for water, food, or other forms of financial protection (31).
In this study we found there was restricted access to family planning in Uganda during the COVID-19 lockdown. Nearly half of the participants reported the use of contraception. However, among those who used modern contraception, 59% had difficulty accessing their preferred method. Lack of transport was the commonest (68.7%) limiting factor to accessing SRH services and information during the lockdown. This was followed by physical distance from home to the health care facility (55.2%), cost of services (42.2%), and curfew (39.1%). Travel in motor vehicles, including private cars, taxis and buses, was banned in an effort to contain the spread of the COVID-19 in the community. Lack of motor transportation is compounded if the clinic is so far from home that walking is impractical. The lockdown also had an economic impact, as businesses closed, unemployment increased, and the cost of living increased. Thus, SRH services became less affordable. Inequalities in the disease burden and access to health

care is prominent concern in Uganda and the economic impact of the shutdown could only exacerbate this problem (32).
STIs were the most commonly reported SRH problem. Lack of access to treatment is not only a problem for the infected individual. It is a public health problem due to potential spread of the disease. Participants also reported unwanted pregnancies, a significant public health problem that existed long before the pandemic. In 2008, more than half of the 2.2 million pregnancies in Uganda were unwanted (33). Teenage pregnancy has increased in Uganda during the COVID-19 lockdown (34). The closing of schools may have played a role in this increase, as girls are more vulnerable to abuse or rape outside the educational environment, which is more secure. It is also probable that a major additional factor was lack of access to SRH services, which are critical in the prevention of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion, reducing maternal and child morbidity-mortality and empowering women (35).
This study had some limitations. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions to enrich the study findings were not possible, due to social distancing restrictions during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. The study was limited to young people who had access to internet and social media and an understanding of the English language. Furthermore, a respondent driven virtual snowball sampling method was used. Therefore, our findings may not be taken as a representation for the general Ugandan youth's population; our sample was skewed, as a very high percentage of participants had a university education. Finally, we do not have baseline comparison data from before the COVID-19 lockdown.
CONCLUSION
In this study, young people in Ugandan reported poor access to sexual and reproductive health services during the COVID-19 lockdown. Lack of transportation and the price of services were the commonest factors reported as limiting access to SRH services. STIs and unwanted pregnancies were the most prevalent problems faced by Ugandan youth during the COVID-19 lockdown. There is a need for the Uganda government to collaborate with other stakeholders in developing guidelines for ensuring access to SRH information and services during any future outbreaks. Such guidance should include response plans for health facilities and the communities. New public health approaches are needed to strengthen supply chains and public information during crises that disrupt schools, health services, and community centers. Policymakers should define and promote sexual and reproductive health care as an essential service during any outbreak.
SUMMARY
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted access to healthcare, including sexual and reproductive health (SHR) services. An online cross-sectional study was conducted between 28th April and 11th May 2020 to explore factors affecting access to

SRH services among Ugandan youth during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. In all, 724 Ugandan youth participated in the online survey. More than a quarter of respondents reported that during the lockdown, they had limited access to SRH services, such as testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) treatment, and contraception. Lack of transportation, distance to health facilities, and the high cost of services were the most commonly reported barriers to access. Marital and employment status as well as education level were statistically associated with the reported factors and problems to access SRH services. The most commonly reported SRH problems were STIs, followed by unwanted pregnancies, sexual abuse, unsafe abortions, pregnancy complications and lack of antiretroviral drugs. These findings indicate that effective measures need to be put in place to ensure access and availability of SRH services for Ugandan youth during outbreaks such as the COVID-19 lockdown.

The COVID- pandemic has temporarily disrupted access to clinic-based

sexual health care for men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Netherlands.

The importance of home-based sexual health care has been underpinned

as an extension of clinic-based care. This paper aims to assess intention to

use, and acceptability of home-based sexual health care among MSM who

previously attended clinic-based sexual health care. In November

,

MSM who had attended an STI clinic pre-pandemic were invited to participate

in an online survey; MSM completed the survey (response %). Intention

to use self-sampling STI/HIV tests was assessed (median; scale - ) and

compared across sociodemographic and sexual behavior characteristics by

Kruskal-Wallis H tests. Descriptive analyses provided insights in acceptability

of home-based sexual health care. Of participants (median age ), . %

( / ) tested for STI/HIV in the past months, most of them attended a clinic.

The median score on intention to use self-sampling tests was . (SD = . )

and did not di er by sociodemographic or sexual behavioral characteristics

(all p-values > . ). Participants were positive toward online sexual health

counseling (median attitude = . , SD = . ) and their main preferred topics

were PrEP use and STI/HIV testing. MSM who attended clinic-based care

expressed intention to use self-sampling tests and a positive attitude toward

online sexual health counseling. Home-based sexual health care elements

are not currently integrated within Dutch clinic-based sexual health care and

should be considered an addition for continued provision of care and extended

reach of MSM.

Introduction
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States and China reported difficulties in access to testing services for sexually transmitted infections (STI) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (1, 2). Disruptions in access to sexual health care services were reported in many other countries, including in the Netherlands (3). Lower testing rates were observed in a context where MSM remained sexually active during lockdown situations and social distancing measures in the Netherlands, as to the United Kingdom reported sexual activity remained high (4).
In recent years, new opportunities for STI/HIV testing include commercial home-based alternatives, which include self-tests and self-sampling tests (5). To extend clinic-based care, home-based sexual health care could be a cost-effective possibility when compared with health care in a clinic, as demonstrated in the United Kingdom (6-8). Home-based sexual health care consists of self-collection of samples, and additional online sexual health counseling, for example about PrEP and chemsex. Home-based alternatives for testing can overcome perceived and experienced barriers among MSM for STI/HIV testing at STI clinics such as privacy, confidentiality, and time-constraints (9, 10). Home-based care options enable continual access to care for MSM who seek sexual health care, and due to COVID-19 restrictions, personal needs, or other reasons, experience barriers to clinic-based testing or sexual health counseling. Insights into added value remains limited on combining STI and HIV tests in complete homebased sexual health care, with high quality STI/HIV diagnostics and additional sexual health care opportunities, such as sexual health counseling on safe sex, PrEP and, chemsex (11, 12). An ongoing study from the United States identified a lack of counseling additional to home-based testing among male couples (13), but acceptability of sexual health counseling was not specified.
Self-sampling STI and HIV tests are provided by commercial initiatives in the Netherlands, with the main challenge being the lack of provision of complete sexual health care services, i.e., including testing for both STI and HIV, sexual health counseling, treatment, and partner services (14). Such comprehensive sexual health care is provided by location-based STI clinics. Selfcollection of samples for STI and HIV testing outside of a clinical setting has not yet been implemented in sexual health care by Dutch STI clinics (15, 16).
The current study assessed the opportunities for homebased sexual health care in MSM who previously attended clinic-based sexual health care. Therefore, we assessed the intention, behavioral determinants (e.g., attitude, social norms, self-efficacy) and acceptability of self-sampling testing and online sexual health counseling.

Materials and methods
Data collection
In the Netherlands, STI/HIV testing and sexual health care is organized via STI clinics (Public Health Services), offering free of charge care to high-risk groups, including MSM. Other care options include the general practitioner or hospital, though here patients may need to pay for STI and HIV tests. In November 2020 we invited 424 MSM by email to participate in an online survey. After two reminders were sent, respondents were able to complete the survey until February 2021. This was a cross-sectional study with a convenience sample. Respondents in this study had participated in a previous study before the COVID-19 pandemic (2018) and were recruited during their regular consultation by an STI nurse in one of nine STI clinics in the Netherlands (Supplementary Table S1). The invited study cohort consisted of respondents who previously consented to participate in future studies (Supplementary Table S2). Respondents were eligible to participate if they reported to be male and had sex with other men.
Measurements
The survey assessed STI/HIV testing behavior, intention to use self-sampling testing, related behavioral determinants, and acceptability of home-based sexual health care. Furthermore, sexual behavior, PrEP and drug use behavior were assessed. Sociodemographic information such as age, level of education and ethnicity were available from pseudo-anonymized data from the STI clinic consultation. Upon consent at the start of the survey, STI clinic data was linked to the survey data by a code.
STI/HIV testing behavior
Participants reported when and where they had tested for STI and HIV in the past 6 months. STI/HIV testing is defined as testing urogenital, anorectal, and oropharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), syphilis or HIV. A multiple response question assessed where participants tested the last time (e.g., at general practitioner, STI clinic, hospital, or, by a self-sampling test). Self-sampling testing was defined as self-collection of specimens analyzed by a laboratory for the results, whereas results of self-testing is interpreted by the individual (5). The survey defined selfsampling STI and HIV testing as "taking a urine sample, anorectal and oropharyngeal swabs and blood sampling by fingerstick". Online sexual health counseling was defined as counseling by a health care professional via videocalls, chat, or a telephone call. Participants were presented with

a context-in line with current Dutch practice-where these services would be available without costs and offered by the Public Health Service.
Intention to use a self-sampling test
Use of a self-sampling STI/HIV test is seen as behavior, which is determined by intention, behavioral beliefs, attitude, efficacy beliefs and normative beliefs of the individual (17, 18). In line with explanatory theory regarding behavior (e.g., Theory of Planned Behavior, Reasoned Action Approach) Table 1 shows items and measures to capture determinants of self-sampling testing.
Acceptability
Acceptability of self-sampling STI/HIV testing were assessed in mode of access (e.g., home delivery or pickup location), receiving instructions how to use the self-sampling tests (e.g., via website, via peers, through telephone counseling). Whether participant were positive toward online sexual health counseling was measured from "negative" (0) to "positive" (100) by the question "are you negative/ positive toward online sexual health counseling". Acceptability of modes of communication for online sexual health counseling (e.g., telephone call, webcam, or chat) and what topics to discuss (e.g., chemsex, PrEP use) were assessed using multi response questions (Supplementary Tables S3, S4).
Sociodemographic and sexual behavioral characteristics
For current analyses, age groups and numbers of sex partners were defined based on tertile distributions. Categories for ethnicity and level of education were based on definitions of the Central Bureau of Statistics in the Netherlands (www.//cbs.nl). Sexual behavioral data included number of sex partners, condomless anal intercourse (CAI) with a casual partner, HIV status, use of PrEP, engagement in chemsex, and STI/HIV testing in the past 6 months. For analyses, CAI was defined as either receptive or insertive anal intercourse without a condom. Casual partners included fuckbuddies, partners of whom they did not know their names, participants of group sex, customers (of sex work), sex workers, and friends. Chemsex was defined as having used one or more of the following drugs: crystal meth, cocaine, 2-CB, 3MMC, 4-FA, 4-MEC, GHB, GBL, ketamine, MDMA, mephedrone, speed and XTC, before or during sex in the past 6 months (19).

Statistical methods
Characteristics of the study population were presented by descriptive analyses; a Chi-square test compared these characteristics among respondents' and non-respondents' characteristics of the invited study cohort. Subsequently, a Chi-square test was used to compare sociodemographic and sexual behavioral characteristics between recent (past 6 months) and non-recent testers (more than 6 months ago). Self-sampling and participants' behavioral determinants, i.e., intention to use self-sampling tests were presented using descriptive statistics. Attitude, self-efficacy, and intention showed strong (>0.7) Pearson correlations, hence the strongest predictor for behavior according to Theory of Planned Behavior/Reasoned Action Approach (i.e., intention) was chosen as outcome to assess differences between population subgroups. A Shapiro-Wilk test revealed that intention to use self-sampling testing was not normally distributed (p = 0.000). Therefore, a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to compare median intention across sociodemographic and sexual behavioral subgroups. Last, acceptability was demonstrated by descriptive analyses and a Chi-Square test compared several (dis)advantages among participants with low and high intention to use a self-sampling test. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics V26.
Results
Of 424 invited MSM who previously attended a Dutch STI clinic, 154 MSM participated (response rate of 36%). Participants in this study were mostly of western ethnicity (95.5%; 147/154) and 63% (97/154) were highly educated, median age was 47 (IQR = 22.2) (Table 1). Majority of participants were HIV negative (81.8%; 126/154), 37.7% (58/154) reported PrEP use and 37.0% (57/154) engagement in chemsex in the past 6 months. Median number of sex partners was five (IQR = 8) and CAI with a casual partner was reported by 59.7% (92/154).
STI/HIV testing behavior
During the COVID-19 pandemic, 60.4% (93/154) of the participants tested for STI or HIV (mostly for both) in the past 6 months, 23.4 % (36/154) indicated to have tested more than 12 months ago. Of participants who tested in the past 6 months (recent), 84.9% (79/93) tested at the STI clinic (56.5%; 87/154), 9.7% (9/93) have tested at the GP or at a hospital (9.7%; 9/93). Only 3.2% (3/93) reported selfsampling STI or HIV testing, whereas no participant used a self-test. Among recent STI/HIV testing MSM a higher number of sex partners, CAI with a casual partner, PrEP

Intention to use a self-sampling test
Figure 1 presents scores from 1-100 on behavioral determinants. Score of intention to use self-sampling tests was 86.5 (IQR = 50) and participants had positive attitude toward self-sampling testing (median = 88.5, IQR = 50). In addition, participants felt capable of performing a self-sampling test (median = 100, IQR = 19), and they perceived self-sampling to be easy (median = 83.5, IQR = 42). The thought of performing self-sampling test made them reassured (median = 90, IQR = 42). Scores of expected social support of people whose opinion they value was 87 (IQR = 34) and 79 (IQR=44) for the expected approval of these people. Participants estimated that most of their male friends (median = 81, IQR = 29) and male sex partners (median = 77.5, IQR = 32) would use a self-sampling test.
The median scores on intention to use self-sampling testing were not statistically significantly different by ethnicity, age, level of education or, by sexual behavioral characteristics (all p-values > 0.1) (Supplementary Table S5).

Acceptability of home-based sexual health care
Self-sampling STI/HIV testing
Table 3 shows perceived advantages and disadvantages of self-sampling testing. Most reported advantages were saving time (77.9%; 120/154) and autonomy in deciding when to test (76.6%; 118/154). Participants with a high intention (53.9%; 83/154) to use a self-sampling test, reported these advantages more in comparison to participants with low intention. Perceived disadvantages included having to take the blood sample by themselves (57.8%; 103/154), and lack of a supporting conversation with a health care professional at a clinic (48.7%; 75/154). Participants with a low intention (46.1%; 71/154) to use a self-sampling test more often reported concerns about performing the test correctly.
As to obtaining self-sampling tests, 79.2% (122/154) of participants preferred home delivery, 38.3% (59/154) via pickup location (e.g., at a STI clinic, GP, or hospital), and 3.2% (5/154) to receive the test from a peer-friend or sex partner. Accompanying self-sampling tests, 33.1% (51/154) was unsure whether additional instructions were necessary, 33.8% (52/154) reported to probably need additional instructions and mentioned further instructions via a website (74.8%; 77/103), via support of a health care professional (52.4%; 54/103), or 5.8% (6/103) from peers. Of all participants, 83.1% (128/154) would

Discussion
This study provided insight into intention to use and acceptability of home-based sexual health care for MSM who previously attended clinic-based sexual health care. Most participants tested for STI or HIV clinic-based during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent testing was higher in MSM who had multiple sex partners, had CAI with a casual partner, used PrEP, and engaged in chemsex in the past 6 months. Most

participants recently tested in clinics, and they expressed a high intention to future use of (non-clinic based) self-sampling STI/HIV tests. These results did not differ between population subgroups. Self-sampling tests are preferably ordered online with home delivery, their instructions are equally preferred online. In addition, a positive attitude toward online sexual health counseling was found and topics most often preferred to be addressed in online counseling were PrEP use and ways of STI/HIV testing. We showed acceptability of homebased care to continue reaching MSM who attended clinicbased care. Preferably, home-based care would also be able to extend the reach of sexual health care, by decreasing testing barriers. More research is needed to assess whether home-based sexual healthcare increases the reach of sexual health care in populations who have no previous experience with attending sexual health care.
The uptake of STI/HIV tests has decreased among MSM during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a result of downscaling clinic-based sexual health care and stricter triaging (3). Therefore, this pandemic underlined the need for home-based sexual health care, including STI/HIV testing for MSM (1, 2). Global studies have reported high feasibility and acceptability among MSM of testing outside a clinic (20-22). The current study demonstrated intention to use self-sampling STI/HIV

testing in a population of MSM who previously attended clinicbased sexual health care. Additionally, we established a positive attitude toward online sexual health counseling. Several studies have suggested integration of home-based care in existing sexual health care to increase STI/HIV testing uptake and ensure quality of sexual health care (10, 11, 23). Particularly a recent study from the United States, which modeled an increase of HIV incidence when testing in clinical setting is completely replaced by home-based testing (24). Thus, home-based sexual health care should be considered an extension of existing clinicbased care.
Previous studies have emphasized minor variation in sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, education) among intention to use STI/HIV testing outside a clinical setting (25, 26). Consistent with results in this paper, we previously established a positive attitude toward self-sampling testing in a cohort of Dutch HIV-positive MSM (16). Therefore, homebased sexual health care should be designed for a diverse and extensive group of MSM who previously attended clinic-based care. An inclusive approach should be accomplished by tailored home-based sexual health care, which would provide with free and easy-to-use tests to tackle perceived barriers (26).
Implications from this study should be interpreted considering respondents' previous experience with clinic-based

sexual health care. Home-based care should not solely be designed to extend the reach of existing sexual health care, also to continue reaching MSM who attended clinic-based care before (27). Since participants mainly identified internet-based options, home-based sexual health care for MSM should provide with online opportunities. Fitting home-based care would consist of ordering self-sampling STI/HIV tests online accompanied with online instructional content. Consequently, previous research recommends use of illustration and detailed verbal instructions when self-sampling testing (28). Within home-based care, online sexual health counseling should be

available as an additional option to clinic-based counseling and could take place by telephone call, via a chat function, or webcam managed by a health care professional. In addition, previous studies have suggested the use of mobile apps as a mode of communication for home-based sexual health care (22, 29). Within online sexual health care counseling topics such as PrEP use and STI/HIV testing could be discussed. Furthermore, home-based sexual health care could be considered a costefficient option, (6, 8) therefore financial allocations can prioritize reaching out to higher-risk groups who are hard to reach with existing sexual health care. Future research should

also include assessing possibilities for home-based sexual health care for other key populations such as transgender people and sex workers.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, response for this follow-up study sample (36.3%; N = 154) was lower than anticipated. Yet, the sample may be only minimally subject to bias due to loss-to-follow-up as proportions of sociodemographic and sexual behavioral characteristics were similar to the invited study cohort (Supplementary Table S2). Second, the invited study sample included MSM with somewhat higher sexual risk behavior, the median number of sex partners (6 vs. 5, p = 0.02) and STI positivity rate were higher (23 vs. 19%, p = 0.02) compared to total MSM population who visited the participating STI clinics (19). This slightly affects the generalizability of the results of the study to all MSM who visit an STI clinic. However, we expect that impact on generalizability is minimal as intention to use self-sampling testing was not associated with numbers of sex partners and STI outcome. Generalizability of the results to MSM who did not visit an STI clinic is unknown, but it is possible that the intention to use home-based care and positive attitude toward home-based sexual health care might be lower in this group. Third, at the time of the study integration of home-based sexual health care elements were limited within Dutch STI clinics. Therefore, this study assessed behavioral determinants rather than actual use of self-sampling STI/HIV testing (30). Fourth, the quantitative nature of this study did not allow elaborate qualitative reporting on acceptability. Nevertheless, this study did provide detailed information on acceptability of homebased sexual health care among MSM who previously attended clinic-based sexual health care.
Conclusion
Although current self-sampling STI/HIV testing is rarely used by MSM who previously attended clinic-based sexual health care, results present that MSM would consider future use of a self-sampling STI/HIV test. Home-based sexual health care including self-sampling STI/HIV testing and online sexual health counseling might be a possibility to extend sexual health care to continue servicing MSM with proper sexual health care.

Abstract
Introduction: Men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who inject drugs (PWID) are disproportionately impacted by the HIV epidemic in Canada. Having the second-highest provincial diagnosis rate, an improved understanding of the epidemic among these populations in Québec could aid ongoing elimination efforts. We estimated HIV incidence and other epidemic indicators among MSM and PWID in Montréal and across Québec using a back-calculation model synthesizing surveillance data. Methods: We developed a deterministic, compartmental mathematical model stratified by age, HIV status and disease progression, and clinical care stages. Using AIDS and HIV diagnoses data, including self-reported time since the last negative test and laboratory results of CD4 cell count at diagnosis, we estimated HIV incidence in each population over 1975-2020 by modelling a cubic M-spline. The prevalence, undiagnosed fraction, fraction diagnosed that started antiretroviral treatment (ART) and median time to diagnosis were also estimated. Since the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted testing, we excluded 2020 data and explored this in sensitivity analyses. Results: HIV incidence in all populations peaked early in the epidemic. In 2020, an estimated 97 (95% CrI: 33-227) and 266 (95% CrI: 103-508) HIV acquisitions occurred among MSM in Montréal and Québec, respectively. Among PWID, we estimated 2 (95% CrI: 0-14) and 6 (95% CrI: 1-26) HIV acquisitions in those same regions. With 2020 data, unless testing rates were reduced by 50%, these estimates decreased, except among Québec PWID, whose increased. Among all, the median time to diagnosis shortened to <2 years before 2020 and the undiagnosed fraction decreased to <10%. This fraction was higher in younger MSM, with 22% of 15-24 year-olds living with HIV in Montréal (95% CrI: 9-39%) and 31% in Québec (95% CrI: 17-48%) undiagnosed by 2020 year-end. Finally, ART access neared 100% in all diagnosed populations. Conclusions: HIV incidence has drastically decreased in MSM and PWID across Québec, alongside significant improvements in diagnosis and treatment coverage--and the 2013 introduction of pre-exposure prophylaxis. Despite this, HIV transmission continued. Effective efforts to halt this transmission and rapidly diagnose people who acquired HIV, especially among younger MSM, are needed to achieve elimination. Further, as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV transmission are understood, increased efforts may be needed to overcome these.

We have the biomedical tools to eliminate HIV [1]. Yet, transmission continues to occur in Canada. In fact, HIV diagnoses have recently stabilized at counts near those observed in the

late 1990s [2,3]. Across Canada, key populations, including men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who inject drugs (PWID), are disproportionately burdened by the HIV epidemic. In Québec, which had the second-highest provincial HIV diagnosis rate in 2019 [2], only 3.4% of adult men

reported sex with another man in the previous 12 months [4]. Yet, MSM accounted for 71% of new male diagnoses that year [5]. People who ever injected drugs comprised 0.8% of Québec adults [4], but 0.7-5.5% of new diagnoses in recent years belonged to that population [5].
In 2016, Canada endorsed the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) efforts to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a public health threat [6]. Cities, where key populations often reside, play a crucial role in HIV epidemics [7]. Québec's epidemic epicentre lies in Montréal where 61% of new 2019 diagnoses occurred [5]. In 2017, Montréal became the first UNAIDS Fast-Track City in Canada, committing to HIV elimination by 2030 [8,9]. Interim, 2020 targets aimed for zero new HIV acquisitions, a strengthened treatment and care cascade (reaching 95% diagnosis coverage, 95% of those diagnosed on treatment, and, of those, 95% virally suppressed by 2025), zero discrimination and zero stigma [10]. Measuring the target of zero new HIV acquisitions is difficult as it cannot be directly observed. New diagnoses have been used as a proxy [10]; however, these reflect mostly past incidence and are affected by testing efforts. Analyses discerning new acquisitions from diagnoses while accounting for testing trends are needed.
Timely estimates of new HIV acquisitions are necessary to monitor progress towards elimination and identify unmet prevention needs. Doing so requires modelling tools synthesizing surveillance data, allowing the back-calculation of HIV incidence using information, such as CD4 cell count at diagnosis and HIV testing history [11]. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) estimates HIV incidence using a statistical back-calculation method based on HIV and AIDS diagnoses and HIV/AIDS-related deaths [12]. Overall national and provincial estimates, and those stratified by exposure category (e.g. MSM and PWID), are typically produced and provided to provincial public health authorities. Overall Québec estimates have been reported up to 2018 [13]. However, the last publicly reported exposure category estimates for Québec are from 2011 [14]. Moreover, age-stratified and city-level estimates are not available.
To inform provincial elimination efforts, we aimed to estimate HIV incidence in Québec and its largest city (Montréal) over 1975-2020, stratified by age, for two key populations: MSM and PWID. We simultaneously estimated key HIV epidemic metrics of prevalence, undiagnosed fraction and time to diagnosis. We achieved this by developing, parameterizing and calibrating a multi-state back-calculation mathematical model synthesizing granular surveillance data and capturing the disease's natural progression and treatment and care cascade. These metrics can provide detailed information for communities and health authorities to identify unmet prevention needs and sustainably curb HIV transmission.
2 METHODS
2.1 Data sources
We obtained surveillance data on AIDS cases (1979-1998) and new HIV diagnoses (2003-2020) from the Institut national de santé publique du Québec (INSPQ). The AIDS data are aggregated and stratified by exposure category and sex.

The HIV diagnosis data are annual and stratified by region, exposure category, sex, age, self-reported time since the last negative test and CD4 cell count at diagnosis. The exposure categories are mutually exclusive and assigned hierarchically, with men who had sex with another man classified as MSM and those who injected drugs as PWID. Those who both had sex with another man and injected drugs are categorized separately and not considered here.
2.2 Modelling framework
We developed a deterministic, compartmental mathematical model using Bayesian back-calculation methods to estimate HIV incidence over 1975-2020 among distinct, open populations of MSM and PWID (active and past injecting history) aged 15-99 years. Extending the approaches of others [15,16], we stratified the population of interest (MSM and PWID) by HIV status and, among people living with HIV (PLHIV), by primary infection and CD4 cell count categories, diagnosed status and treatment status (untreated and ever treated) (Figure 1). The model is further stratified by 5-year age groups.
Individuals enter the model susceptible to HIV acquisition (Figure 1). Those who acquire HIV progress to the primary stage, where the model assumes no diagnoses occur. After this short period, individuals enter the different CD4 cell count compartments, some at lower counts [17,18]. The subsequent horizontal flow models disease progression through decreasing CD4 cell count. The vertical flow models the clinical care cascade of diagnosis and starting antiretroviral treatment (ART). Individuals exit the model due to all-cause, injection-related (active PWID), or AIDS-related mortality.
The model is solved using an Euler algorithm and 0.01year time step, coded in R (v.4.0.3) using a C++ back-end via the Rcpp library [19-21]. Analyses are conducted separately by exposure category, sex and region (Montréal and the whole province), with Montréal defined by the public health unit "région sociosanitaire 06."
2.3 HIV incidence estimation
We modelled HIV transmission over 1975-2020 using a smooth incidence curve formed with cubic M-splines [16,22], setting the first coefficient to zero. The incidence rate denominator comprises those at risk of acquiring HIV: all susceptible MSM and actively injecting PWID, respectively. Where feasible, we modelled age-stratified incidence by estimating a random effect per 10-year age group. Finally, we varied the number and location of spline knots and determined the best fitting incidence curve considering both the Watanabe- Akaike information criterion (WAIC) and leave-one-out crossvalidation information criterion.
2.4 Parameterization: demography, testing and ART initiation
Demographic information was drawn from census data, population-based health surveys and vital statistics (Supplementary Materials). The MSM and PWID (ever injected) population sizes were assumed proportional to the male and total populations, respectively. The active PWID population

Figure 1. Model flow diagram. The index i indicates age groups (15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-

decreased with time (Figure S1), as informed by local estimates [23-25]. Disease progression was parameterized using published literature. Where possible, local studies informed the testing and ART parameters. Table S9 details all parameter sources.
We modelled HIV testing and diagnosis among those susceptible to and living with HIV. Testing rates differed by CD4 cell count, reflecting asymptomatic and symptomatic testing. Except for symptomatic diagnoses among those with CD4 <200 cells/l, testing started in 1985 and subsequently increased over time. It was modelled using a flexible logistic growth function capturing testing trends that reflect treatment advances, testing recommendations and recent empirical estimates. Upon a first positive test, a certain proportion of HIV diagnoses are reported to the surveillance database. Others, at times, may be delayed and classified as such ("delayed report"). The model accounts for these using a reporting fraction varying between 2003-2011 and 2012-2020, as the surveillance system started including those without Québec's universal health insurance in 2012.

ART initiation rates varied by time and CD4 cell count to match guideline changes. These indicated ART for those with CD4 350 cells/l from 1996 to 2012 [26-28], 500 cells/l from 2013 to 2015 [27-29] and all PLHIV from 2016 onward [29]. Accordingly, all ART initiation rates were zero until 1996 (upon highly active ART availability) or until the eligibility criteria indicated use. The rate additionally varied between 1996-2003 and 2004-2012, with a higher rate in the latter period reflecting increasing access and acceptability over time. The rates were fixed and assumed equal across eligible categories.
2.5 Model calibration
We calibrated the model to the following outcomes, excluding 2020 data due to uncertainties in how testing disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the observed diagnoses: (1) aggregated AIDS cases (1979-1998); (2) annual HIV diagnoses by sex and age (2003-2019), and CD4 cell count at diagnosis (2013-2019); and (3) annual proportion of

diagnoses reporting a negative HIV test result <12 months ago by sex and age (2003-2019). In estimating the agespecific incidence, we grouped the data by 10-year age categories to avoid small counts of diagnoses and ensure the stability of estimates. CD4 cell count had missing data (12% and 11% among MSM and 22% and 19% among PWID in Montréal and Québec, respectively), which were assumed to be missing completely at random. Regarding testing history, individuals who were unsure when last tested (<4% of observations) were considered not to have been tested for HIV in the past 12 months. As reported elsewhere [30], initial crossvalidation suggested that self-reports of a negative test <12 months ago were subject to a telescoping bias. We accounted for this by assuming these self-reports referred to periods up to 18 months.
We adopted a Bayesian calibration framework. Specifically, we used maximum a posteriori estimation [31] with prior distributions elicited for each unknown parameter (Table S9). Point estimates were obtained by minimizing the negative posterior log-likelihood of the model. This optimization occurred in two steps. First, we defined a distribution using a Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm with starting values from the Nelder-Mead algorithm [32]. Secondly, to approximate the posterior distribution, we performed sampling importance resampling using 50,000 parameter sets from that proposal (i.e. multivariate t-distribution) and resampling 1000 sets without replacement, applying standardized importance weights. We summarized posterior distributions using the median. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles approximated 95% credible intervals (CrI).
2.6 Additional epidemic metrics
With the estimated incidence curve, we calculated the HIV prevalence (total PLHIV/total population), the fraction undiagnosed (total in primary and undiagnosed compartments/total PLHIV) and the fraction of diagnosed PLHIV that started ART (total in ever treated compartments/total in diagnosed [untreated] and ever treated compartments). Lastly, we calculated the median time to diagnosis annually using period life tables [33]. Each life table began with the total new HIV acquisitions from a given year and, over time, counted diagnoses from each CD4 cell count category or upon AIDSrelated death, assuming those who acquired HIV were subject to that same year's testing rate throughout their lifetime.
2.7 Sensitivity analyses
Due to uncertainties in the active PWID population size, we varied the assumed size to assess the impact on mortality. We also varied some of the assumed parameters for disease progression and treatment initiation, as described in the Supplementary Materials (Section 5). Lastly, calibrating up to 2019 data and predicting incidence through 2020 assumes incidence was unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In sensitivity analyses, we included 2020 data in calibration and assessed the incidence with 0%, 25% and 50% reductions in testing rates over March-December 2020.

2.8 Ethics
This study received ethics approval from the McGill University Research Ethics Board (REB#: A12-E84-18A). Consent was not necessary as we used aggregated information (from deidentified and anonymized databases) from routinely collected surveillance data.
3 RESULTS
3.1 Surveillance data
From 1979 to 1998, 3582 AIDS cases classified as MSM were reported across Québec [34], with 2791 from Montréal [35]. Over that same period, 375 AIDS cases classified as PWID were reported provincially [34], with 300 from Montréal [35]. The new HIV diagnoses reported over 2003- 2019 among MSM totalled 3488 and 2286 across Québec and Montréal, respectively. Of these, 23% and 26% reported recently testing negative in those same regions. Among PWID, 390 and 174 new HIV diagnoses were reported in Québec and Montréal, respectively, 10% of which recently tested negative in both regions. Lastly, since 2013, the CD4 500 cells/l category had the highest proportion of reported new diagnoses, comprising 40% and 43% of MSM diagnoses and 31% and 38% of PWID diagnoses in Québec and Montréal, respectively.
3.2 Model selection and fits
Our calibrated models reproduced the surveillance data and key epidemic features (Figure 2 and Figures S4-S9), with almost all data points falling within the modelled uncertainty bounds. The best-fitting models had 3-5 knots depending on strata (Table S13). In general, the WAIC did not change substantially across the models explored.
3.3 Epidemic trajectory: men who have sex with men
The HIV incidence curves among MSM exhibited two peaks throughout the epidemic. The first, in the mid-1980s, reached its highest and impacted all ages. Montréal MSM had the highest overall incidence rate of 1.2 per 100 person-years (PY; 95% CrI: 0.9-1.6 per 100 PY) at its first peak in 1985, with 501 (95% CrI: 397-640) HIV acquisitions that year (Figure 3). The provincial MSM epidemic closely followed this trend, albeit with a smaller peak of 0.8 per 100 PY (95% CrI: 0.6-1.0 per 100 PY), but 617 (95% CrI: 493-778) HIV acquisitions. For more than a decade afterward, incidence among MSM declined. Nevertheless, it again started trending upward by the end of the 1990s. Around then, differences in the estimated age-stratified incidence became apparent, increasing considerably in those aged 25-34 and 35-44 years (Figure 4 and Figure S10). After reaching an overall rate of 0.4 per 100 PY (95% CrI: 0.3-0.6 per 100 PY) and 0.3 per 100 PY (95% CrI: 0.2-0.4 per 100 PY) in the mid-to-late-2000s in Montréal and Québec, respectively, this trend reversed. Finally, in 2020, incidence potentially increased. At 2020 year-end, the estimated incidence rate was 0.2 per 100 PY (95% CrI: 0.0- 0.5 per 100 PY) and 0.3 (95% CrI: 0.1-0.6 per 100 PY) in

Model fits to the calibration outcomes among men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who inject drugs (PWID) in Montréal and the province of Québec: (a) the number of reported AIDS cases; (b) the number of reported new HIV diagnoses; (c) proportion of reported new HIV diagnoses that recently tested negative (<18 months ago); and (d) proportion of reported new HIV diagnoses per CD4 cell count category. The black points and lines display the model-predicted outcomes, with the black bars and grey bands showing their corresponding 95% credible intervals. The coloured points and bars display the outcomes from the Institut national de santé publique du Québec (INSPQ) data and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals, where applicable.

Montréal and Québec, with 97 (95% CrI: 33-227) and 266 (95% CrI: 103-508) HIV acquisitions estimated that year in each region, respectively (Table 1 and Figure 3).
HIV prevalence followed a trend similar to incidence, peaking in the early 1990s at 9.5% (95% CrI: 7.6-12.0%) in Montréal and 6.3% (95% CrI: 5.1-7.8%) in Québec (Figure 5). After dipping slightly, following the peak in AIDS deaths (Figure S18), the prevalence continued rising until the midto-late-2010s. These trends were largely mimicked across age groups, except for those <35 years, whose prevalence stabilized (Figure S11). By 2020 year-end, prevalence in MSM was estimated at 10.4% (95% CrI: 8.3-12.6%) in Montréal and 7.8% (95% CrI: 6.2-9.2%) provincially (Figure 5).
The undiagnosed fraction decreased upon testing availability in 1985 (Figure 5). Among MSM, an estimated 4.3%

(95% CrI: 2.3-7.2%) and 7.9% (95% CrI: 4.6-12.4%) of PLHIV in Montréal and Québec, respectively, were undiagnosed at 2020 year-end (Table 1 and Figure 5). Correspondingly, up to the start of 2020, the median time to diagnosis decreased to 1.5 (95% CrI: 1.3-1.7 years) and 1.9 years (95% CrI: 1.7-2.1 years) in those same regions (Figure 5). Important differences in the percentage undiagnosed were observed in younger MSM, especially 15-24 year-olds, among whom 21.2% in Montréal (95% CrI: 8.5-39.0%) and 31.1% in Québec (95% CrI: 17.0-47.5%) remained undiagnosed by the end of 2020 (Figure S12). Lastly, the percentage of diagnosed PLHIV that started ART increased over time, reaching almost 100% (Figure 5 and Figure S13).
Sensitivity analyses incorporating testing reductions and including 2020 data in calibration resulted in lower incidence

Estimated HIV incidence over 1975-2020 among men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who injected drugs (PWID) in Montréal and the province of Québec: (a) the annual number of HIV acquisitions among MSM and active PWID; and (b) the HIV incidence rate among MSM. Incidence rates are not presented for PWID due to uncertainties in the denominator (the active PWID population size over time).

unless testing was reduced by 50%, where it was similar to our main results (Figures S19-S21 and Table S14). The undiagnosed fraction was also lower unless testing was reduced by 25% and 50%, where it was similar to and possibly higher than our main estimates.
3.4 Epidemic trajectory: people who inject drugs
The HIV incidence curve among actively injecting PWID had one peak. The highest annual incidence occurred in the late1980s-to-early-1990s with 70 (95% CrI: 53-96) and 105 (95% CrI: 56-179) HIV acquisitions in Montréal and the province, respectively. After these peaks, incidence trended downward (Figure 3). In 2020, 2 (95% CrI: 0-14) and 6 (95% CrI: 1-26) HIV acquisitions were estimated in Montréal and Québec, respectively (Table 1 and Figure 3). Similar regional trends were seen among active male and female PWID (Figure S14), but with wider uncertainty ranges and more acquisitions estimated among males. Due to uncertainties in the time-varying active PWID population size, incidence rates are not presented for this population.
HIV prevalence among lifetime PWID increased until the late-1990s-early-2000s, reaching 3.3% (95% CrI: 2.5-4.7%) and 2.4% (95% CrI: 1.6-3.7%) in Montréal and Québec,

respectively (Figure 5). As AIDS-related deaths diminished (Figure S18) and incidence somewhat levelled off, prevalence stabilized and decreased slowly to 2.4% (95% CrI: 1.7-3.5%) in Montréal and 1.8% (95% CrI: 1.2-2.6%) in Québec by 2020 year-end. When stratified by sex, similar trends were estimated (Figure S15).
The PWID population also saw large declines in the undiagnosed fraction (Figure 5 and Figure S15). By 2020 yearend, 1.6% (95% CrI: 0.4-7.1%) and 2.8% (95% CrI: 1.0-8.0%) of PLHIV were undiagnosed in Montréal and Québec, respectively (Table 1 and Figure 5). The median time to diagnosis also decreased up to 2020, reaching 1.3 (95% CrI: 0.8-3.4) and 1.8 (95% CrI: 1.0-3.2) years in those regions (Figure 5). Finally, the percentage of diagnosed PLHIV that started ART similarly increased to almost 100% (Figure 5 and Figure S15).
None of these results were appreciably impacted by the active PWID population size or ART initiation rates. Including 2020 data in calibration did affect results (Figures S19-S21 and Table S14). Among Montréal PWID, there were potentially fewer HIV acquisitions in 2020, even with testing reduced by 50%. In contrast, acquisitions and the undiagnosed fraction increased among PWID across Québec as, in this case, the observed diagnoses substantially increased from 2019 to 2020.

4 DISCUSSION
Accurately measuring progress towards elimination is challenging, yet, synthesizing complex information from surveillance and other data can help overcome some limitations. We developed a multi-state back-calculation Bayesian model and estimated key elimination indicators of new HIV acquisitions, the burden of disease and the cascade of care. Our findings suggest that--among key populations historically bearing the highest burden--HIV incidence has drastically decreased and,

in MSM, may have reached near 0.1 per 100 PY, the proposed elimination threshold for HIV as a public health threat. However, the goal of zero new HIV acquisitions was not reached and could be further from sight due to HIV service interruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. While less than 14 HIV acquisitions could have occurred among PWID in Montréal, we projected 97 (95% CrI: 33-227) HIV acquisitions in 2020 among MSM. Across the province, 6 (95% CrI: 1-26) acquisitions in PWID and 266 (95% CrI: 103-508) in MSM were projected.

Our results also point to rapid and robust improvements in the treatment and care cascade. The fraction of undiagnosed PLHIV is estimated at 4.3% (95% CrI: 2.3-7.2%) among Montréal's MSM, a finding supported by the Engage cohort [36,37], and 1.6% (95% CrI: 0.4-7.1%) among PWID. Therefore, Montréal has already reached the 2025 goal of 95% diagnosed among these populations. However, setbacks could have occurred since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Provincially, slightly higher proportions were unaware of their status: 7.9% of MSM (95% CrI: 4.6-12.4%) and 2.8% of PWID (95% CrI: 1.0-8.0%). Previous studies suggested PLHIV residing outside of urban areas could face additional barriers in accessing healthcare, including stigma, further distance to providers coupled with inadequate transportation and local providers being less experienced with HIV and/or key populations [38,39]. There were also proportionally more young MSM unaware of their status, highlighting their unmet prevention needs. Lower diagnosis coverage among younger PLHIV also reflects HIV's transmission dynamics: young people have a higher incidence and smaller cumulative testing exposure [33,40]. Concomitant with diagnosis coverage improvements, we estimated shortened diagnostic delays. Still, further reductions could impact onward HIV transmission if linkage to care is prompt.
Finally, almost 100% of diagnosed PLHIV have taken ART-- in line with empirical estimates from a Montréal clinical cohort [41] and Engage [36], suggesting high proportions of diagnosed PLHIV are being linked to care. While this does not speak to current use or levels of viral suppression, these

studies did estimate >95% of those diagnosed were on ART and, of those, >88% were virally suppressed [36,41]. Although we do not model the impact of ART on transmission directly, its successful scale-up likely played a part in the incidence declines over the last decade. Moreover, preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was introduced for MSM in 2013 and could have accelerated incidence reductions, especially amidst increased usage in recent years [42,43], where coverage (i.e. those currently on PrEP) rose from 5% to 10% between 2017 and 2018 in Montréal [43].
Given the richness and granularity of Québec's HIV surveillance data, we tailored our model to its intricacies. PHAC's back-calculation method is general to accommodate the different provincial data streams. We explicitly describe the clinical course of HIV, allow testing rates per disease stage and calibrate to multiple sources of recency information, all of which could more accurately estimate incidence. Moreover, modelling ART captures reduced mortality and improves our prevalence estimation. The trends in incidence did follow those modelled by PHAC until 2011 among MSM and PWID in Canada [14]. Their 2011 Québec-specific estimates suggested 425 (290-560) and 9690 (7880-11,500) MSM acquired and were living with HIV that year, respectively [14]. Among PWID, they estimated that there were 60 (40-80) HIV acquisitions and 3000 (2400-3600) PLHIV [14]. In that same year, we projected fewer HIV acquisitions (297, 95% CrI: 215-370 in MSM and 10, 95% CrI: 6-17 in PWID) and a smaller population of PLHIV (6928, 95% CrI: 5469- 8334 MSM and 1046, 95% CrI: 689-1544 PWID). Despite

possibly underestimating incidence in the mid-1990s, from 2000 onward, our MSM incidence rate and prevalence estimates reassuringly aligned with that observed by cohort studies in Montréal (Figures S16 and S17).
This study has several limitations. First, the paucity of data informing the active PWID population sizes, and the potential underrepresentation of active PWID in the available estimates, necessitated additional assumptions in this regard. Therefore, we did not provide HIV incidence rates for PWID and focused on HIV acquisitions. Moreover, we lacked appropriate PWID cross-validation data as local studies [44,45] have focused solely on individuals actively injecting, whereas we modelled all people who ever injected drugs. Further, despite modelling reporting delays, we did not have strong estimates to inform them. However, we believe most transmissions occurring and diagnosed in Québec have a high probability of being reported without delay, and our calibrated reporting fractions reflect this (approximately 70-80% across populations). Concerning demography, we do not capture the migration of PLHIV. Not unlike other models, this could affect the prevalence and undiagnosed fraction, the extent to which depends on the level and direction of the net migration of PLHIV in the MSM and PWID populations. In our setting, we expect net migration to be small and our estimates to be robust. Our cross-validation to the Engage study's prevalence is also reassuring. Finally, HIV testing could have fluctuated in recent years. Potential increases alongside PrEP scale-up, for example, could identify more undiagnosed PLHIV through consultations, leading our model to overestimate incidence [46]. Despite this, the number of diagnoses remained relatively stable. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted testing in 2020, and the extent to which is not yet known [47]. Thus, we explored this in sensitivity analyses.
5 CONCLUSIONS
The UNAIDS Fast-Track City goals are ambitious. Meeting and maintaining targets of zero new HIV acquisitions, 95% diagnosis coverage, 95% treatment coverage and 95% viral suppression requires an actionable response and epidemic monitoring. Leveraging detailed surveillance data complemented by other sources, we provided up-to-date estimates of important epidemic metrics among key populations in Montréal and across Québec. This work demonstrates how such back-calculation mathematical models can be applied in a Canadian context to estimate incidence, compared to only monitoring diagnoses, and other jurisdictions with similar data could do the same. Identifying effective policies to progress towards and sustain elimination is crucial, especially in light of the possible setbacks from the decline in prevention service access and use during the COVID-19 pandemic [47]. Future work exploring the population-level impact of interventions that could be scaled-up, such as PrEP, could inform these.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is a recent outbreak in mainland China and has rapidly spread to multiple countries worldwide. Pulmonary parenchymal opacities are often observed during chest radiography. Currently, few cases have reported the complications of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. We report a case where serial follow-up chest computed tomography revealed progression of pulmonary lesions into confluent bilateral consolidation with lower lung predominance, thereby confirming COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, complications such as mediastinal emphysema, giant bulla, and pneumothorax were also observed during the course of the disease.

INTRODUCTION

CASE REPORT

Since December 2019, several cases of "a new coronavirus infection" having an unknown origin have emerged from the city of Wuhan in China's Hubei province (1, 2). The novel coronavirus was identified on January 6, 2020 and was termed as 2019-nCoV (3); the virus was speculated to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Market, Wuhan. As of February 25, 2020, widespread human-to-human transmission has resulted in 80239 cases in 26 countries, with 2701 deaths (4). To date, there have been few reports on chest computed tomography (CT) findings of complications arising from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. We reviewed a case of COVID-19 pneumonia with mediastinal emphysema, giant bulla, and pneumothorax.

A 38-year-old man from Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, presented with binaural hearing loss and tinnitus lasting for two months. He underwent endoscopic tympanometry on January 16; on the second postoperative day, he went outdoors and caught a cold. His body temperature was elevated to 38.1°C.
Laboratory examination revealed a normal percentage neutrophil count (75%, normal range: 40-75%) and a decreased percentage lymphocyte count (14.8%, normal range: 20-50%). Screening was negative for multiple respiratory pathogens including influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human parainfluenza virus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and chlamydia pneumoniae. The patient's sputum tested positive for 2019-nCoV in a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay.
On January 26, the patient developed a high fever and cough and was initiated on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy. The fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2) was 80%, while the gas flow-rate was 20 L/min. The patient was continued on HFNC oxygen therapy from January 26 to February 4. On February 1, he suffered from chest tightness and palpitation. The arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) could reach 90% after oxygen therapy. On February 5, he exhibited aggravated dyspnea and severe hypoxemia (SpO2 < 70%). He received non-invasive mechanical ventilation in

the intensive care unit until February 10 with symptomatic relief. The initial FiO2 was 60%, while the gas flow-rate was 50 L/min. The modes used were pressure support ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure with 1.18 KPa (12 cmH2O) and 0.98 KPa (10 cmH2O), respectively. Thereafter, the patient continued to receive HFNC oxygen therapy until the last follow-up CT scan.
The initial chest CT showed ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the left lower lobe (Fig. 1A). Over the next 10 days, the lesions increased in extent and density and progressed to consolidation (Fig. 1B-D). The clinical symptoms deteriorated, and acute respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed. A follow-up CT scan revealed emphysema (Figs.1D, 2A, B). After 15 days of supportive treatment, chest CT showed an improvement in the pulmonary lesions, disappearance of the mediastinal emphysema, and appearance of a giant bulla in the left lung (Figs. 1E, F, 2C, D). Eight days later, the final follow-up CT scan revealed a small pneumothorax and pleural effusion in the left thorax (Figs. 1F, 2E, F).

DISCUSSION
Due to its high sensitivity and ease-of-use, chest CT is an important screening tool for suspected COVID-19 patients. The most common CT finding in COVID-19 pneumonia is GGO in the subpleural regions of the lower lobes (5). These findings are mainly seen in the early stages of COVID-19 pneumonia and may be attributed to alveolar swelling, a small amount of exudation in the alveolar space, and alveolar septal inflammation caused by infection (6). Some cases respond poorly to treatment, and localized lung lesions progress to multiple and diffuse lesions.
This case, occurring in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pneumonia outbreak, illustrates the potential severity of this disease. Serial follow-up chest CT showed the progression of the pulmonary lesions into confluent bilateral consolidation with a lower lung predominance. The patient did not have a history of pneumothorax or any underlying pulmonary disease; no abnormalities, such as a small bulla or emphysema, were observed in the initial CT

scan. The patient had no history of smoking. As a result of diffuse alveolar injury in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the alveoli may be prone to rupturing. Furthermore, the patient developed a pronounced cough, which may also induce alveolar rupture. Mediastinal emphysema results from a sudden increase in the alveolar pressure, causing alveolar rupture and air leakage with interstitial emphysema (7); this can be observed in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (8). In addition to the giant bulla, chest CT also revealed multiple bullae in the subpleural lung zones (arrowheads; Fig. 2C, E), where pneumonic consolidation was more prominent than in the contralateral areas, which could easily rupture and cause pneumothorax. While mediastinal emphysema and pneumothorax are well-known complications of mechanical ventilation, the patient only received HFNC oxygen therapy before the emphysema

occurred. Therefore, in this particular case, we speculate that the mediastinal emphysema and pneumothorax may be related to COVID-19 pneumonia.
In conclusion, we reported the CT findings in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed mediastinal emphysema and pneumothorax. Once the signs of these complications are observed during the course of COVID-19 pneumonia, special attention should be paid, and active measures should be taken. Therefore, early imaging diagnosis and timely treatment of COVID-19 complications can improve the therapeutic effect and reduce mortality.

Abstract: We conceptualized and numerically investigated a photonic crystal fiber (PCF)based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor for rapid detection and quantification of novel coronavirus. The plasmonic gold-based optical sensor permits three different ways to quantify the virus concentrations inside patient's body based on different ligand-analyte conjugate pairs. This photonic biosensor demonstrates viable detections of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-bindingdomain (RBD), mutated viral single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) and human monoclonal antibody immunoglobulin G (IgG). A marquise-shaped core is introduced to facilitate efficient light-tailoring. Analytes are dissolved in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and surfaced on the plasmonic metal layer for realizing detection. The 1-pyrene butyric acid n-hydroxysuccinimide ester is numerically used to immobilize the analytes on the sensing interface. Using the finite element method (FEM), the proposed sensor is studied critically and optimized for the refractive index (RI) range from 1.3348-1.3576, since the target analytes RIs fluctuate within this range depending on the severity of the viral infection. The polarization-dependent sensor exhibits dominant sensing attributes for x-polarized mode, where it shows the average wavelength sensitivities of 2,009 nm/RIU, 2,745 nm/RIU and 1,984 nm/RIU for analytes: spike RBD, extracted coronavirus RNA and antibody IgG, respectively. The corresponding median amplitude sensitivities are 135 RIU-1, 196 RIU-1 and 140 RIU-1, respectively. The maximum sensor resolution and figure of merit are found 2.53 × 10-5 RIU and 101 RIU-1, respectively for viral RNA detection. Also, a significant limit of detection (LOD) of 6.42 × 10-9 RIU2/nm is obtained. Considering modern bioassays, the proposed compact photonic sensor will be well-suited for rapid point-of-care COVID testing.

1. Introduction
Considering the existing and continuously developing label-free biosensing assays, the emergence of fast mutating Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) necessitated more compact, inexpensive, scalable, and portable solutions for rapid viral pathogen detection and associated integrative systems with point-of-care (PoC) compatibility. Having highly contagious nature, as of May 27, 2022, the number of worldwide confirmed COVID-19 cases has been over 525 million with reported casualties of over 6.2 million since its exposure in the city of Wuhan, China in 2019 [1]. In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledged this unprecedented outbreak as a global pandemic posing a high risk to vulnerable countries with underdeveloped healthcare systems [2]. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the positive-sense singlestranded RNA virus group which manifests quick respiratory illness than its former strains, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) [3].

In addition to predominant abnormal respiratory symptoms, infected patients with acute cardiac arrests, kidney damages and liver function irregularities have been largely documented indicating myocardial, renal, and hepatic injury due to the pathogenic activity of this virus [4]. The capacity to jump over cross-species barrier facilitates this virus to mutate at a large scale which is apparent by its frequently introducing variants e.g. B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B1.351 (Beta), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) [5]. Regardless of the variants, this virus consists of four biologically significant proteins. Spike glycoproteins act as the viral RBD, whereas the envelope proteins and the membrane proteins are scattered on the lipid bilayer membrane. Nucleocapsid protein or the single-stranded RNA is encapsulated inside this external frame. To get access to host cells, after infiltrating the prospective body from contaminated surfaces or aerosols, a subunit of spike RBD binds with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is available in most of the vital human organs [6]. Therefore, this subunit has been at the peak of researchers' attentions, as preventing surface receptor binding of the virus could be a potential treatment for this disease [7]. On the other hand, extraction of the viral RNA has also been highlighted for studying reverse genetically engineered antiviral platforms [8]. Moreover, the RNA proteins and spike RBD proteins are being constantly used in laboratory-based coronavirus screening.
To date, real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is regarded as the gold standard for RNA detection. However, it is restricted to well-equipped healthcare facilities with experienced users and hence, not suitable for in situ monitoring of COVID-19 patients. To avoid procurement delays, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been adopted by several researchers. Lately, Tang et al. [9] presented a LAMP assay coupled with a glass nanopore-based digital amplicon counter which is only enabled for qualitative analysis of the virus. The lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) are very cost-efficient paper-strips-based testing kits, commonly used in medicine for PoC medical diagnostics. Despite being convenient for rapid low-cost detection of SARS-CoV-2 in resource-poor areas, this simplified assay can only give binary (yes/no) outputs disabling further quantitative assessment [10]. The new chemiluminescent assay (CLIA) possesses limited scalability for its costly operation [11]. Nouri et al. [12] presented a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-assisted nanopore biosensor which suffers from sensitivity constraints for a limited turnaround period.
Viruses need to intrude appropriate host cells for replicating and propagating genetic materials. The human immune system produces monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) i.e. different immunoglobulins to terminate infected cells via phagocytosis and among them, IgG usually becomes available within 3-6 days following infection [13]. For SARS-CoV-2, the measurement of immune response to this antigenic invasion by detecting and quantifying mAbs plays an important role both in rapid detection of the virus and antibody therapeutics. For home use, 47 antibody PoC diagnostic test kits have been approved by The Board Decision on Additional Support for Country Responses to COVID-19 [14]. As their accuracies were not up to the mark, some lab-based detection schemes are also presented by biomedical engineers. For example, Tré-Hardy et al. [15] depicted the use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting anti-spike protein antibodies.
Modern plasmonic optical biosensors are anticipated to have great prospects for multiplexed PoC coronavirus sensing. In a work by Cady et al. [16], the emission of fluorescence in a multiplexed coronavirus sensor was amplified by surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) to successfully boost up its sensitivity. Furthermore, SPP-assisted quantum dot-based aptasensor and microplate reader are depicted by other researchers [17,18]. Localized SPR sensors integrated with microfluidic chip and silver nanoarray are lately employed for detections of antiviral antibodies and spike glycoproteins, respectively [19,20]. Two Kretschmann configuration-based COVID-19 sensors are demonstrated in Ref. [21,22] which suffer from the disadvantages of having cumbersome rotary apparatus. To avoid such bulkiness, optical fiber-based SPR biosensors have been heavily appreciated in reported studies [23]. Cennamo et al. [24,25] designed two plastic optical fiber sensors with decent LODs for rapidly screening spike RBD of COVID-19 virions. The above

discussion points out several drawbacks of the current assaying technologies for SARS-CoV-2 particle detections, such as (i) not all existing diagnostic assays and biosensors are PoC-supported; (ii) some required lengthy processing time with trained medical personnel; (iii) many assays are limited by either high cost and/or procurement time and/or portability and/or scalability; (iv) some showed high propensities of false-positive responses; (v) numerous present assays provide only binary (infected/not infected) results and thus, do not allow quantitative analysis; (vi) several coronavirus sensors have not proffered practically favorable performance; (vii) to enable additional sensing options, careful integration of multiple assaying setups is needed; (viii) A very few SARS-CoV-2 sensors are enabled for all 2 types of viral and 1 type of antiviral analytes (spike RBD, RNA, mAbs) detection, and therefore, identifying false-positive outcome becomes difficult.
Simultaneous multianalyte usability makes plasmonic sensors more compact and multioperational. Because of the high degree of freedom in designing PCFs, they are considered one of the perfect candidates for researching multianalyte SPR biosensing [26]. In PCF sensors, sensitivities are enhanced by efficiently facilitating the SPP excitation by means of structural variations. For instance, wavelength sensitivities of a multianalyte sensor by Zheng et al. [27] could reach up to 1535 nm/RIU and 1550 nm/RIU for its different channels using a wagonwheel-shaped design. Controlled single-mode light propagation and birefringence let enhanced superiority to the PCF-based plasmonic sensors over the regular optical fiber sensors. Moreover, microstructured PCFs can demonstrate desirable confinement parameters without requiring specific dopant inclusion for performing critical internal reflections [28]. In 2019, Kaur and Singh [29] showed an undoped silica-based PCF sensor for dual-channel sensing with channel 1 and 2 peak wavelength sensitivities of 1000 nm/RIU and 3750 nm/RIU, respectively. Prior to this, another dual-analyte PCF-SPR sensor also exhibited similar decent sensitivities [30]. External etching of conventional fiber cladding using different mechanical and chemical methods produces various unexpected experimental errors [31]. These problems are absent in PCF fabrication which allow it greater robustness for sensing applications. Yet, no PCF-based SPR sensors have been explored for the purpose of COVID screening so far.
In this work, we conceptualized a PoC compatible plasmonic biosensor for accurately quantifying COVID-19 viral specimens based on a propagation-controlled core PCF which is supported by the SPR phenomena. We did FEM-based numerical simulations and attained improved sensitivities and LODs for our proposed photonic sensor. The location of the analyte layer is selected to be outside the fiber for facilitating fast operations and to simplify the swapping procedure of analytes. Being a stable element, gold (Au) is employed externally to constitute the plasmonic sensing interface and thereby, the likelihood of oxidation is minimized. Two individual channels are introduced to enable real-time on-site multianalyte detections. It is shown that the proposed dual-channel sensor operates without the deficiencies categorized in the texts above. All structural parameters of the PCF (pitch and air hole sizes) and Au thickness are critically studied and numerically optimized. This being the first PCF sensor for early novel coronavirus detection and quantification, it will play an important role in our fight against COVID-19.
2. Sensor design & operation
2.1. Theoretical modeling
A biosensor can be viewed as a device including a transducer and signal processing unit. The sensing interface of the transducer, in association with bioreceptor(s), specifies certain analytes which are eligible for detection by a particular sensor. Our PCF-SPR sensor can promptly detect all three analytes which are investigated so far for SARS-CoV-2 screening. To activate the sensor, certain bioreceptor molecules (which show affinity to the target analyte) act as ligands and are immobilized onto the sensing surface to bind with the chosen proteins. The RI of the sensitive interface of the device then changes depending on the dynamics of the microprotein

organisms. An SPR will be mandated when these ligand-analyte conjugates receive the highest energy from the transmitted light within the leaky fiber core. This peak energy transaction results in a sharp intensity drop (confinement loss) of the input signal at a definite wavelength (aka resonant wavelength) for a fixed analyte RI. Also, the optical frequency perfectly matches with the frequency of naturally oscillating SPPs under satisfied resonance conditions.
We designed a silica PCF that has three sequential rings of hexagonally patterned air holes. The core of the fiber is constructed by scaling down several air holes (RI of air = 1) from all of these rings so that light can propagate within the core by performing modified total internal reflections (mTIR). The electromagnetic wave will distribute throughout the holy core, as the smaller air holes are allowing some high RI regions (fused silica RI 1.45 for visible lights) surrounding them. The refractive properties of background silica can be obtained using the Sellmeier Eq. (1) as a nonlinear function of broadband wavelengths [32].

Here, Bi = 1, 2, 3 and Ci = 1, 2, 3 are defined as the Sellmeier coefficients (B1 = 0.696166300, B2 = 0.407942600, B3 = 0.897479400, C1 = 4.67914826.10-3µm2, C2 = 1.35120631.10-2µm2 and C3 = 97.9340025 µm2).
As depicted in Fig. 1(a), four, six and two air holes diameters are decreased in size from the first, second and third rings, respectively. Thus, the shape of the core resembles that of a marquise-cut diamond. The stacking of glass capillaries to obtain this kind of lattice configuration is displayed in Fig. 1(b) which allows easy fabrication and facilitates mass production. This arrangement of core (small) airholes deliberates 2 horizontal leakage paths through which evanescent electric fields will dissipate energy to the plasmonic Au layer for SPP excitation. Drude-Lorentz model is employed to functionalize the complex relative permittivity of the metal and the optical constants of Au can be accessed from Ref. [32].

The semicircular dual-channels can be used to simultaneously run two independent COVID-19 tests without any interference between them. And there are also no prerequisite conditions for doing so i.e. both tests can either be of the same analyte of different RIs or of different SAR-CoV-2-associated samples. The analyte, dissolved in Sterile Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), will be streamed over the sensor surface for detection. With a pH of 7.4, uncontaminated PBS depicts an RI of 1.3348. Virus transport media (VTM) are used to limit the chance of contamination while carrying or experimenting with any viral sample. The use of PBS is encouraged by the Food and Drug Administration owing to the shortage of conventional COVID-19 VTM [33]. Moreover, as the analyte-PBS solution yields an increasing RI with any denser viral concentration which is slightly greater than clean deionized (DI) water (RI = 1.33), we leveraged this to complete our desired SPR functionalization for target molecules. To visualize the multianalyte sensing feasibility, in Fig. 1(c), we showed the x-polarized mode confinement loss response of our proposed sensor when both channels are filled with the same analyte and when they are filled with different analytes. One can see that the loss spectrum consists of only one resonant peak for the given PBS RI 1.3348 filled in both of the channels. For unknown analytes of RI 1.33 and RI 1.35 in opposite channels, two resonant peaks are observed within a single loss curve.

2.2. Structure & sensing operation
Fabrication of our proposed PCF biosensor is very convenient in all respects. This type of hexagonal lattice with uniformly spaced air holes does not require micro-drilling, since the

structure can be achieved by simple stack and draw method involving capillaries of different wall thicknesses. Cladding layer assists in controlling the desirable levels of light confinement and the field leakage by means of mTIR. Therefore, our FEM-based investigation involves optimization of the core-clad dimensions to confirm our expected waveguiding operation. We finalized the optimum values for regular air hole diameters (d) and small air hole diameters (dc) which are 1.075 µm and 0.33 µm, respectively. A 1µm analyte layer (AL) is found to be adequate for the sensor to function sensitively. The proposed PCF has constant center-to-center spacing (pitch size, ) of two air holes situated next to each other. Upon verifying the holy fiber for several pitches, we selected the optimal pitch to be 1.65 µm. In terms of performance, we showed that an Au nanolayer with a width (t) of 40 nm exhibited improved sensitivity. We recommend atomic layer deposition or nanoparticle layer deposition for placing the Au layer over the round surface of the fiber to confirm greater uniformity and no contamination [34,35].
Figure 2 displays the schematic setup of the presented sensing system. As our sensor is practically a single-mode fiber coated with an Au annular nanofilm, a broadband light source transmits a range of optical frequencies through the fiber after the light is polarized by a transverse magnetic or p-polarizer. Our sensor operates within the suitable visible wavelengths due to the plasma frequency characterized by Au. The COVID-19 samples can be collected from affected patient's nasal cavity using nasopharyngeal swabs and are inactivated through heat or gamma ray [36], whereas the IgG proteins are only available through patient's blood sample. Due to fine compatibility of our sensing kit with most of the RNA extraction procedures, user conserves the freedom to choose either magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) or RT-PCR for segregating the virus RNA [37]. After the samples are dissolved in PBS and floated over the sensor surface, the change of molar concentration varies the activity of the target analytes significantly and results in equivalent RI fluctuation in a linear manner [38]. So, the resonant peaks are relocated by the different molar concentrations of analytes in the sensing channels. 1-pyrene butyric acid n-hydroxy-succinimide ester (PBSE) is responsible for immobilizing the viral and antiviral particles onto the sensor surface. The immobilized bioparticles work as the acting ligand and attach to the target analytes. Besides PBSE, modified ACE2 can be alternatively utilized as spike protein immobilizers [39]. For the range of RI variation for SARS-CoV-2 detection (RI 1.3348-1.3576), a digital system is trained beforehand with the experimental loss curves. The polarized light will show a maximum loss in intensity based on the unknown RI flowing over the sensor. A charged-coupled device or an optical spectra analyzer, probed to the aforesaid computational system, is deployed to collect those modal loss curve readouts. After necessary interpolation, the system retrieves the exact losses and compares them with the in-memory SPR responses to display the final result on a monitor.
It is understandable that our PCF-SPR sensor is basically a refractometer that can precisely measure the RI of the aqueous solution flown over its active surface. To make this optical device

viable for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we translated the molar concentrations of COVID-19 RNA, spike receptor-binding subunit and mAb IgG particles in terms of their equivalent RIs. Mimicking the actual interaction mechanism between SARS-CoV-2 antigens and human ACE2, Forssén et al. [40] and Lan et al. [41] established a rate constant distribution algorithm with the help of adaptive interaction distribution algorithm (AIDA) which is used to approximate the concerned RIs initially in our study. Later, we finalized the RIs by evaluating linear regressions following articles [42-44]. The equivalence is listed in Table 1 where the COVID positive/negative threshold is defined in Ref. [45].

3. Simulation results and discussions
3.1. Performance analysis
To perform our wave optics modal analysis based on FEM, we sketched, modeled and simulated the sensor in the commercial software COMSOL v5.5. We selected a large mesh size to increase the modal data accuracy. The simulation was conducted by choosing a predefined cylindrical

perfectly matched layer with default boundary conditions which is liable for absorbing the scattered evanescent field.
Our structure shows very high polarization dependence which results in dominant plasmonic responses in one polarized mode in comparison to the other optical mode. This is engineered by introducing two energy transfer pathways in the lateral direction using our proposed core while blocking other possible paths in the vertical directions setting higher air-contrasted cladding layers. Figure 3(a) displays the leaky electric field dispersions of the fundamental core-guided mode and the SPP mode in the highly responsive x-polarized mode for the RI of uncontaminated PBS. The loss of light intensity due to this core to plasmon energy transference is viewed as the incapacity of confinement of light by the fiber. This is termed confinement loss which can be computed in dB/cm by the following equation where k0 is the wave number and Im(neff ) is the imaginary modal effective index,

(dB/cm) = 8.686 × k0 × Im(neff ) × 104

(3)

Phase matching condition is defined as the coincidence of real modal RIs of the core and the plasmon modes at a particular wavelength. Figure 3(b) shows the occurrence of this phase matching of the presented sensor at wavelength 615.7 nm for analyte RI 1.3348 where the SPR has been triggered. This certifies very strong light-analyte interplay at the sensing channels. The huge difference between peak propagation losses of x and y-polarized modes indicates the induction of intense birefringence. The polarization dependency is allowing this enhanced birefringent response which facilitates the overall stability of the optoelectronic device [46]. The birefringence spectrum at RI 1.3348 in Fig. 3(c) can be found by the absolute difference of effective RI real components for x and y-polarized lights.

The resonant wavelengths change towards the higher or lower spectral region, since they are contingent upon the concentration of microbes at the sensor plane. This happens, because the variation of SPP mode real RIs depending on the activeness of the microproteins defines a newer phase matched SPR point where the loss peak has been updated. Highly concentrated analytes on the sensitive layer produces a large number of ligand-analyte complexes and vice versa. In our PCF sensor, the peak energy transfer points move to the longer wavelengths (red-shifts) because of enhanced viral activity and return to shorter wavelengths for poor number of active analyte bindings. To demonstrate our claim, we numerically inspected all three approaches to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 infection severity and immune responses within patient's body in terms of RIs (correspondent molar densities) of the pertinent analytes.
As discussed above, many of the extraction methods for isolating nucleocapsid protein are time-killing and not PoC usable. Therefore, a faster (30 minutes) MNP-based RNA isolation

strategy has been proposed by a group of scientists that has the capacity to replace the conventional RT-PCR-based nucleic acid extraction in near future [45]. We recommend this novel technique for expediting this RNA extraction process from bulk viral samples. To ready the viral nucleic acid particles for detection, it is mixed with PBS and glided through both channels of the sensor for molar concentration measurement. This is done for RI 1.3462 to RI 1.3576 as mentioned in column 2 of Table 1 and the loss spectra are presented in Fig. 4(a), displaying the red-shifting SPR peaks. We can see the escalations of loss depths for increased applied RIs inside sensor channels. Because, while the test RI is increasing, the declining RI contrast between the fundamental core mode and the plasmon mode results in upgraded modal loss peaks [26]. The peak propagation loss increases from 62 dB/cm to 101 dB/cm when the uncontaminated PBS is exploited with 300 nM viral RNA, equaling an RI of 1.3576. In this experiment, the SPR spectral shifts are 24.3 nm, 2 nm, 3 nm, 6.5 nm, 6.5 nm, 7 nm and 9 nm for the test saline concentrations of 0 nM, 150 nM, 165 nM, 180 nM, 210 nM, 240 nM, 270 nM and 300 nM, respectively. The resonant shift caused by a unit change in RI (na) is defined as the wavelength sensitivity (4).

S(nm/RIU) = peak (4) na

We sited a maximum sensitivity of 3948 nm/RIU at RNA concentration 270 nM or RI 1.35532 in
the wavelength interrogation method, whereas the mean sensitivity is 2745 nm/RIU. Besides, for
the positive threshold concentration, this sensitivity is 2851 nm/RIU. The sensing parameters
are tabulated in Table 2. We intentionally took non-uniformly different molar concentrations of
coronavirus RNA for the analysis as our highest priority was to achieve extremely exact operation
around the positive threshold RI value. As a result, the corresponding RIs varied in accordance
with molar densities and so do the sensitivities. The initial sensitivity decrease is proffered by
the large RI gap form pure PBS to 150 nM RNA solution. Afterward, the sensitivities showed a
consistent increase with our expected estimations. With an approximation of minimal spectral resolution (min) as 0.1 nm, a sensor resolution of 2.53 × 10-5 is calculated for the detection of this COVID-19 genetic material. In amplitude interrogation, a peak sensitivity of 240 RIU-1 is outputted for the initial RI with an average sensitivity of 196 RIU-1 (please see Fig. 4(b)). The threshold RI amplitude sensitivity is estimated to be 185 RIU-1. Amplitude sensitivities are
calculated using the Eq. (5) below.

sensitivity and the full-width-half-maxima (FWHM) at the same RI, specifically for our sensor,
FOMs show high proportionality to the sensitivities. Because the FWHMs are found significantly
constant (3739 nm) for our designed structure. Including these abovementioned performance
indicators, LODs (=Resolution/ S) for RNA sensing are also contained in Table 2. A very small LOD of 6.42 × 10-9 RIU2/nm is offered by the proposed SPR sensor at applied RI of 1.35532. Figure 4(c) shows that the R2 is almost approximating unity (0.9992) when a second-order
polynomial curve is fitted to interpolate the resonant wavelengths.
The antigenic spike RBD sensing and quantification involve the same series of tasks. In
incorporation with PBS, the solution will be pumped into the sensing channels for PoC detection.
The loss behavior and sensitivities are checked by applying the RIs from 1.3348 to 1.3468 who are
representing concentrations from 0 to 62.5 nM (as listed in column 4 Table 1). The right-shifted
resonant maxima are portrayed in Fig. 5(a) as they proffer wavelength sensitivities from 1867
nm/RIU to 2284 nm/RIU for spike protein RIs according to their order in the Tables 1, 3. The
threshold sensitivities and the exact spectral positions for each SPR are also available in Table 3. The average amplitude sensitivity and FOM are 135 RIU-1 and 53 RIU-2, respectively and the
individual sensitivity spectra are visualized in Fig. 5(b). Minimal wavelength resolution and LOD are estimated to be 4.38 × 10-5 RIU and 1.92 × 10-8 RIU2/nm while investigating spike glycoproteins for experimented molar concentrations. Here, the R2 equals unity and we depicted
the fitted characterization curve in Fig. 5(c).

quantification is also of great interest in generating longitudinal data for qualitative studies on
administered vaccines [47]. From the list in Table 1, RIs corresponding to IgG concentrations
(RI 1.3348-1.3465) are studied and maximum and median spectral sensitivities are respectively
obtained 2257 nm/RIU and 1984 nm/RIU, where the COVID positive threshold sensitivity is
1786 nm/RIU. The loss curves and representative amplitude sensitivity curves are depicted in
Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), respectively. More numerical details regarding the detection of mAb IgG are summarized in Table 4. The highest FOM and smallest LOD are computed to be 59 RIU-1 and 1.96 × 10-8 RIU2/nm respectively for antibody sensing. The magnitude of R2 is again found to
be 1 (see Fig. 6(c)) indicating simplified computation of arbitrary RI by the processor.

3.2. Multianalyte operation
Figures 7(a-c) show real-time multianalyte sensing ability of the prescribed biosensor for practical coronavirus cases. Here, channel 1 is consistently infiltrated with unadulterated PBS when channel 2 analyte is sequentially varied by the highest concentrations of PBS-dissolved microanalytes (300 nM RNA, 62.5 nM spike protein and 27.8 nM antiviral IgG). Their corresponding RIs can be located in Table 1. Within the singular loss spectrum, the resonant loss peaks in lower wavelengths are due to the pure PBS, whereas our analytes are causing the 2nd loss peaks at higher wavelengths in those three figures. Individual channels containing differently active micro-organic solutions are allowing this efficient multianalyte COVID-19 quantification by optically coupling with the same PCF core at separate SPR frequencies depending on the viral infectivity.

To better understand this simultaneous multianalyte detection opportunity, we further elucidated the procedure while experimenting the viral RNA and evaluated the correspondent sensitivities. In Fig. 7(d), we can see similar double peak loss spectra when both channel 1 and channel 2 RIs are continuously being altered. For sample RI 1.3348 in Channel 1 and RI 1.35076 in channel 2, the peaks are sited at 615.7 nm and 655 nm respectively. Other two RI pairs representing RNA samples are (1.34730, 1.35532) and (1.34848, 1.35760) and the spectral locations (in nanometers) of their associated resonant loss peaks as ordered pairs are (646, 662) and (650, 674) respectively. On the other hand, Fig. 7(e) is portraying loss curves for analyte variations from RI 1.3462 to 1.3576 in channel 2 when channel 1 analyte is kept fixed at RI 1.3348. All of them depicted two distinguishable SPR peaks within a single curve. Therefore, it is also evident that the inductions of double SPRs are similarly distinct for constant RI in one channel. During multianalyte performance inspection, we found the highest amplitude sensitive response of 233 RIU-1 as shown in Fig. 7(f). Alongside real-time multipurpose detections, this feature gives the leverage of identifying false-positive and false-negative responses (if they occur) instantly unlike many other immunoassays. The erroneous results are detected when the user is aware that the

Research Article

Vol. 30, No. 22 / 24 Oct 2022 / Optics Express 40288

channels are engaged with the same unknown SARS-CoV-2 sample of the same concentration and yet displaying more than one SPR peak in one loss spectrum. Afterward, the original sensing output can be obtained by simply recalibrating the system and repeating the test. This is very useful even though the proposed sensor is designed to avoid all false detections. Au-based plasmonic sensors usually show these fake responses because of losing the steepness of resonant curves in longer wavelengths [48]. The consistency of FWHM (38 nm as seen in Tables 3&4) for changing RIs warrants that this problem does not apply to our sensor.

3.3. Optimization & tolerance investigation
To maximize the sensor efficacy and estimate tolerable fabrication imperfections, we fixed all of the dimensional variables of the proposed PoC sensor by investigating the optimality of operation. The critical study is done in terms of modal loss variations for x-polarization when RI 1.3348 (Pure PBS) is infused in both channels. Because, sensor sensitivity is directly reliant upon the propagation loss proffered by the optical device [26]. The Thickness of the annular metal coating regulates the RI contrasts surrounding the analyte layer and directly modulates sensitivities as a consequence. Figure 8(a) depicts the confinement losses when the thickness of the Au deposit changes from 30 nm to 50 nm where that modal loss is suppressed by escalating widths of the Au layer. In addition to RI 1.3348, we used RI 1.3465 to evaluate the spectral and amplitude sensitivities. Resonant points moved in the forward direction by about 21 nm, 24 nm and 26 nm for t equaling 30 nm, 40 nm and 50 nm, respectively. This clearly implies better wavelength sensitivity for thickened Au layers. However, from the perspective of amplitude interrogation, the sensitivity at RI 1.3348 drops to 214 RIU-1 from 229 RIU-1 due to this increase (please see Fig. 8(b)). The changing trend of amplitude sensitivities is similar to the trend of loss depth variation. We selected an Au coating of 40 nm for our SPR sensor considering the trade-off of sensitivities in different interrogation methods so that we can receive decent performance regardless of the interrogative approach.

The elegance of the propagation-controlled design can be understood by the high structural tolerance it has demonstrated. The PCF showed high sustainability of its loss characteristics when scrutinized for structural changes up to ±10%. For instance, Fig. 8(c) is literally showing no fluctuations of SPRs in respects of spectral positions and depths of losses for varied analyte layers

(AL) from our prescribed value. Furthermore, for any change in optimal pitch size (=1.65µm), the spectral shift is no more than 2 nm. Figure 8(d) displays that the confinement loss magnitudes increased by 16 dB/cm and decreased by 15 dB/cm for  of 1.82 µm and 1.48 µm, respectively. The cladding air holes changes depicted even lesser variations (see Fig. 8(d)). The change of losses in core-guided mode range from merely +9% to -9% for ±10% fluctuations from our suggested diameter size (d = 1.075). When moderating core air holes, peak losses of 47 dB/cm, 54 dB/cm, 71 dB/cm and 83 dB/cm were observed for successively varying the dc = 0.33µm by -10%, -5%, 5 and 10% as shown in in Fig. 8(f). Again, for both types of air holes, movements in SPR wavelengths are not heavily inflected showing maximum deviations of 2.5 nm due to these changes in diameters. The above discussion proves that the likely levels of fabrication defects will not have major impacts on the overall sensing functionality and detection performance.
4. Conclusions
We designed a PCF sensor for accurate multianalyte detection purposes of influential coronavirus specimens with PoC supportable features. The operating principle of this sensor is the SPR shifts of condiment loss tips resulting from varied analyte concentrations over the sensing interface. Molar concentrations of living micro-organic compounds are representative of their pathogenic activities inside the host's body. Therefore, we interpreted equivalent RIs of those concerned concentrations and successfully showed detection feasibility by plasmonic PCF-based photonic sensing strategy. The proposed sensor offers highly sensitive detections of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and RNA proteins as well as serological quantification of antibody IgG. The sensor is designed to give COVID-positive results provided that at least the threshold concentrations were sensed and negative results for lower concentrations. Apart from only depicting positive or negative outcomes, it can appropriately measure the exact concentration of corona particles in a given viral sample. So, it can be used as a bioparticle counter which is in high demand in the field of antibody therapeutics and vaccinology. To further accelerate rapid diagnosis, we engineered this photonic sensor enabling the option of multiple operations using two channels for different COVID tests at the same time. In our proposed procedure, PBS solution and target groups of analytes act as solvent and solute respectively to realize the detection. To evaluate the performance, we adopted FEM-based numerical analysis and examined the spectral characteristics in terms of confinement loss curves. We found average wavelength sensitivities of 2,745 nm/RIU for RNA detection, 2,009 nm/RIU for spike protein detection and 1,984 nm/RIU for IgG quantification. Also, the corresponding amplitude sensitivities are 135 RIU-1, 140 RIU-1 and 196 RIU-1. The most intensified sensing responses are observed for viral RNA detection, and it exhibited a high FOM of 101 RIU-1 with a significantly small LOD of 6.42 × 10-9 RIU2/nm. The proposed sensor will be a very useful portable device in resource-limited medical facilities and will significantly surpass the limitations of existing viral assays.

ABSTRACT (max 200 words)
Objective To describe the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the incidence of paediatric viral respiratory tract infection in Oxfordshire, UK. Methods Data on paediatric Emergency Department (ED) attendances (0-15 years inclusive), respiratory virus testing, vital signs and mortality at Oxford University Hospitals were summarised using descriptive statistics. Results Between 1-March-2016 and 30-July-2021, 155,056 ED attendances occurred and 7,195 respiratory virus PCRs were performed. Detection of all pathogens was suppressed during the first national lockdown. Rhinovirus and adenovirus rates increased when schools reopened September-December 2020, then fell, before rising in March-May 2021. The usual winter RSV peak did not occur in 2020/21, with an interseasonal rise (32/1,000 attendances in 0-3yr olds) in July 2021. Influenza remained suppressed throughout. A higher Paediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS) was seen for attendees with adenovirus during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic (p=0.04, Mann-Witney U test), no other differences in PEWS were seen. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 caused major changes in the incidence of paediatric respiratory viral infection in Oxfordshire, with implications for clinical service demand, testing strategies, timing of palivizumab RSV prophylaxis, and highlighting the need to understand which public health interventions are most effective for preventing respiratory virus infections.

INTRODUCTION
Respiratory tract infections (RTI) represent a major global disease burden in children, particularly in children under five years of age. Lower RTI are one of the top ten causes of mortality and morbidity considered by the World Health Organisation (WHO)(1). Although many RTIs are mild and self-limiting, they remain one of the commonest reasons for primary care consultation, attendance in emergency departments, hospital admission and antibiotic prescribing. In the UK, incidence of upper RTI is around 300,000 cases per 100,000 people per year(2), with children <5 years experiencing as many as 10 infections/year(3).
Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, common causes of RTI included bacterial pathogens (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae [in settings with low vaccination rates], Haemophilus influenzae) and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza, adenoviruses, rhinovirus, respiratory enteroviruses and non-SARS-CoV-2 human coronaviruses (hCov), with viral infections accounting for ~40-50% of RTI presentations. Symptomatic paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection remains uncommon, accounting for <2% of COVID-19 cases in England, with few severe infections and deaths (1-5/100,000 paediatric infections requiring admission, and even fewer requiring intensive care admission). Particular attention has been related to rare presentations in children with paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally-associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) which can be life-threatening, with 44% of PIMS-TS admissions in the UK requiring intensive care(4-6).
Notably however, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in major observed changes to the wider epidemiology of RTIs, driven by social distancing, use of face coverings and periods of lockdown including closure of daycare and educational settings. This has led to reduced opportunities for virus transmission, and potential shifts in interactions and competition amongst respiratory pathogens. This includes significant reductions in non-SARS-CoV-2-associated RTIs in adult and paediatric populations(7-13). Atypical rebounds and peaks in rhinovirus and RSV infections have been observed following the loosening of social restrictions and reopening of educational settings, likely partly driven by waning population immunity given the lack of exposure to these pathogens during 2020(14-23). This has been particularly prominent in the case of RSV, with presentations reported in a significantly older population of children than would usually be affected(23).
Here, we describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of paediatric viral RTI in Oxfordshire, UK.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) is a tertiary referral centre consisting of four hospital sites in Oxfordshire: three hospitals in Oxford serving a population of 655,000, and a fourth in Banbury with a catchment population of around 150,000. Emergency Departments (ED) in Oxford and Banbury see children between the age of 0-15 years.
Data on paediatric ED attendances, baseline characteristics such as age, gender, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation (IMD), hospital admission (general wards vs. critical care), respiratory virus test results (within the first 24 hours after arrival at ED), vital signs (all heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation readings recorded in the ED) and mortality (within 14 days of a positive respiratory virus test) were sourced from the Infections in Oxfordshire Research Database (IORD, https://oxfordbrc.nihr.ac.uk/research-themes-overview/antimicrobial-resistance-and-modernisingmicrobiology/infections-in-oxfordshire-research-database-iord/).
During the study period, respiratory virus testing was performed according to local protocols, detailed in table 1. Platforms used are detailed in supplementary table 1.
Data on the strictness of lockdown policies restricting people's behaviour in England were sourced from Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)(24). This `stringency index' is calculated from containment and closure policy indicators capturing information on containment and closure policies such as school closures and restrictions in movement, plus an indicator recording public information campaigns.
Data were categorised into pre-pandemic (before 23-Mar-20) and pandemic (23-Mar-20 onwards) periods. 23-Mar-20 was the date that the UK government announced plans for a national lockdown, selected here to reflect the approximate time when widespread behaviour changes occurred in the UK, rather than the date when SARS-CoV-2 was first introduced into the UK. As only heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturations were reliably available, partial Paediatric Early Warning Scores (PEWS) using the Alder Hey PEWS(25), were used as a marker of disease severity, and calculated based on highest heart rate, highest respiratory rate and lowest oxygen saturation recorded, in attendances where all 3 parameters were available.
Statistical analysis Data analysis was performed using R version 4.0.2. For comparisons between pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, Pearson's Chi-squared test was used for categorical data and Mann-Whitney U test for numeric data. Kruskal-Wallis was used for comparisons between the PEWS for different pathogens.

RESULTS
Demographics of patients presenting to Paediatric ED Between 1-March-2016 and 30-July-2021, 155,056 Paediatric ED attendances were recorded from 81,339 individuals (supplementary figure 1). The median number of attendances per individual was 1 (IQR 1-2, range 1-52). 41.3% were aged 0-3 years, 37.9% aged 4-11 and 20.7% aged 12-15. The majority of attendances were by males (87,010 (56.1%)) and children of white ethnicity (118,314 (76.3%)). The median Index of Multiple Deprivation score (IMD) was 11.7 (IQR 7.1-20.1, range 0.5-80; a lower score indicates less deprived areas, placing the median score in the 2nd least deprived quintile in England). There were small but statistically significant differences in age, ethnicity and IMD score between pre-pandemic and pandemic periods (Table 2).
Pre-pandemic, a median of 2,580 attendances were recorded per month, with peaks in attendance each November in the 0-3 year age group. A median of 211 cases (8.2% of attendances) were admitted per month, 8 (0.3%) to critical care. During the pandemic, median attendance was lower at 1,871 per month (p = 0.0002), and the usual seasonal winter peaks were lost, with an atypical summer peak in attendance in June/July 2021 (>1,250 attendances per month, compared to usual June/July attendance rates of ~900/month). A median of 186 cases were admitted per month (10% of attendances), 2 (0.1%) to critical care (p=0.02 and p<0.0001 compared to pre-pandemic, respectively) (Table 2, Figure 1A).
Respiratory virus testing patterns over time A total of 7,195 respiratory virus tests were performed on children during the period observed (1,179 FluA/B/RSV PCR, 1,005 Biofire respiratory multiplex PCR and 5,011 SARS-CoV-2 PCR). Respiratory virus testing rates varied by assay and time (Figure 1B). A median of 4.5 Influenza A/B/RSV PCRs/1,000 attendances were performed pre-pandemic, compared to 7.2/1,000 attendances during the pandemic (p = 0.95), a median of 3.9 Biofire multiplex PCR/1,000 attendances were performed pre-pandemic, compared to 16.7/1,000 attendances during the pandemic (p<0.0001). No SARS-CoV-2 PCRs were performed prepandemic, compared to 163/1,000 attendances during the pandemic. Demographic differences between those tested vs. not tested are shown in supplementary table 2.
Prior to the pandemic the majority of tests (1,119/1,355; 83%) were performed on 0-3 year olds, 182/1,355 (13%) on 4-11 year olds and 54/1,355 (4%) on 12-15 year olds. During the pandemic testing
6

increased in the older age groups; 3,039/5,840 (49%) of tests were performed on 0-3 year olds, 1,773/5,840 (30%) on 4-11 year olds and 1,028/5,840 (18%) on 12-15 year olds, reflecting changes in attendance patterns and testing policies over time.
Respiratory virus detection rates over time One or more respiratory viruses was identified on 1,128/7,195 (16%) respiratory virus tests, on 935/155,056 ED attendances. The distribution of viruses in pre-pandemic and pandemic periods are shown in Figure 2 and Supplementary table 3. Rates of pathogen detection varied over the study period and by assay performed (Figure 1C). The first case of paediatric SARS-CoV-2 in this study was seen on 24-Mar-20, and in the period since the start of the pandemic it has accounted for 15% of respiratory viruses diagnosed in patients attending Paediatric ED.
Pre-pandemic, seasonal peaks of RSV and influenza A/B were observed in September-February and December-March respectively, and to a lesser extent with hCoV in December-March. Rhinovirus and adenovirus exhibited less seasonal variation, with rising case numbers in February in some years. Numbers of parainfluenza and metapneumovirus were too low to detect seasonal variation. The highest incidence of diagnoses was seen in the 0-3 year olds for all pathogens (Figure 3).
The patterns of suppression and resurgence during the pandemic varied by pathogen (Figure 3, Supplementary figure 2). Detection of all pathogens was suppressed during the first national lockdown and during summer 2020 (7 months). Rhinovirus (Figure 3B) and adenovirus (Figure 3D) were the first pathogens to re emerge in September 2020 with incidence rising to to 25 and 10 cases/1000 attendances/month in the 0-3 year age group respectively (a period where schools and childcare facilities were open and lockdown rules were relaxed). Rates fell in January-February 2021, during a period of increased stringency of lockdown measures, then rose again March-June 2021 to 19 and 6 cases/1000 attendances/month in the 0-3 year age group respectively, when stringency of lockdown measures was reduced. No statistically significant difference was seen in age of attendees between pandemic vs prepandemic periods (rhinovirus: pre-pandemic 0.7yr [IQR 0.3-1.6] vs. pandemic 1.3yr [0.7-2.1], p = 0.46 and adenovirus: pre-pandemic 1.2yr [0.6-1.6] vs. pandemic 1.3yr [1.1-1.8], p = 0.35, Chi-squared).
In contrast, RSV (Figure 3A) cases remained suppressed for the first 15 months of the pandemic, much longer than rhinovirus and adenovirus; the usual seasonal winter peak did not occur in 2020/21. In July 2021 RSV rates rose out of season in the pre-school age group (32/1,000 attendances/month in 0-3yr olds), more than double the rate seen pre-pandemic in December 2019 (14/1,000 attendances/month). The median age of RSV attendees was higher during the pandemic (pre-pandemic 0.3yr [IQR 0.2-0.9] vs. pandemic 1.8yr [IQR 0.7-2.8], p = 0.03, Chi-squared).

Influenza A/B (Figure 3C) remained suppressed throughout the pandemic period reported here, with only 1 sample positive in October 2020. This was from a two year old child, with both Influenza A and B detected by PCR, which is highly likely to represent detection of vaccine strain following recent intranasal seasonal influenza vaccination (Fluenz Tetra, which contains live attenuated influenza A and B). Parainfluenzavirus and hCoV rates were unusually high in May-June 2021 to 12 and 7 cases/1,000 attendances/month in the 0-3 year age group respectively (Figure 3F,G). Very few cases of metapneumovirus (Figure 3E) were seen during the pandemic, however baseline rates are usually low.
Samples positive for multiple respiratory viral pathogens Of the 935 ED attendances where a positive respiratory virus test was obtained, 770 tested positive for one pathogen and 165 for more than one (134 with two pathogens, 27 with three pathogens and 4 with four pathogens). There were no samples positive for >1 pathogen during the first national lockdown. Samples positive for >1 pathogen, potentially representing either active co-infection, or several infections arising over a short time period, took longer (2 months) to re-emerge after the relaxation of restrictions than samples with one pathogen. No samples positive for four pathogens were observed during the pandemic (Figure 4).
Disease severity Partial PEWS were calculated for 571 attendances with positive respiratory virus PCRs. There were no significant differences in PEWS between attendees diagnosed with different respiratory viral pathogens pre-pandemic (p=0.27, Kruskal-Wallis). There was no significant difference between PEWS pre- and during the pandemic (p=0.24, Mann-Witney U test). A higher PEWS was seen for attendees with adenovirus during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic (p=0.04, Mann-Witney U test), no other differences in PEWS between pre-pandemic v.s. pandemic periods were seen for other pathogens (all pvalues >0.1, Mann-Witney U test) (Figure 5). There were fewer deaths within 14 days of a positive respiratory virus PCR during the pandemic than before the pandemic (0.3 vs. 0.8 deaths per 100 positive PCRs respectively, p <0.0001).
DISCUSSION
Major changes in the incidence of paediatric viral RTI occurred in Oxfordshire during the pandemic, similarly to the rest of the UK. Following an initial period of low incidence for all pathogens during the first national lockdown, pathogen-dependent patterns of resurgence were seen from September 2020 onwards, with early resurgence of rhinovirus and adenovirus, and a delayed inter-seasonal resurgence of
8

RSV. Although RSV detection rates in July 2021 were high, and occurred in older infants, cases were not clinically more severe.
Oxfordshire data pre-pandemic are representative of seasonal paediatric viral infections, with seasonal winter fluctuations of RSV and influenza(26). Seasonal winter patterns were eliminated during the first UK lockdown period and incidence remained low, as had been the case across Europe (with the exception of France and Iceland)(27), until an inter-seasonal spike in RSV incidence in Oxfordshire in July 2021. Similar inter-seasonal RSV resurgences have been seen in the UK, Europe and countries in the Southern Hemisphere(9,15,21-23), also in older children(27,29-31) (likely due to lack of pre-existing immunity in 12 year olds due to decreased exposure), raising challenges for management of varying presentations of RSV in this older age group. It has been hypothesised that nursery and primary school closures have an impact on RSV transmission due to predominance in children under 5 years old; France and Iceland both had policies of keeping primary schools and daycare facilities open(27). In Oxfordshire, the inter-seasonal RSV spike occurred just as schools closed for the summer holidays, alongside presentations occurring predominantly in pre-school aged children, this raises the question whether daycare settings for younger children (which largely remain open over the summer) are the primary source of transmission, with case numbers fueled by easing of lockdown measures within the general population, parents returning to work and easing of COVID restrictions in daycare settings.
This inter-seasonal RSV peak required a change of testing strategy with an introduction of out-of-season RSV testing and an extension of monthly preventative palivizumab for infants at risk for severe RSV disease(26,28), and contributed to an uncharacteristic summer peak in paediatric ED attendances and pressure on staffing. Influenza remained suppressed throughout, a pattern seen globally(32), presenting challenges for the selection of vaccine strains for the future winter influenza vaccination campaign.
In contrast, less seasonal variability was seen with rhinoviruses pre-pandemic; although their relative prevalence decreases in winter due to influenza interference, they are usually the most prevalent respiratory viral agent during summer months (33,34). Rhinovirus incidence increased to rates above those seen pre-pandemic in September-December 2020 (a period where schools and daycare were open and lockdown rules were relaxed), fell in January-February 2021, and rose again March-May 2021. Similar rhinovirus resurgences were seen in Australia(35), Germany(18), New Zealand(19), Japan(20) and in adults in England(17). A rapid rise in adenovirus, similar to that seen for rhinoviruses after school re-opening, was seen in this study. HCoV show a winter seasonal pattern pre-pandemic, with a rise in detection in May-June 2021. Parainfluenza virus patterns were inconsistent pre-pandemic, rising in June 2021. SARS-CoV-2 incidence reflects the national pandemic infection curves. Reassuringly, no increase in severity (measured by PEWS) was seen in the pandemic period, except for adenovirus.
9

Although it is clear that social distancing measures and school/daycare closures dramatically decreased the incidence of all respiratory viruses at the start of the pandemic, it is difficult to disaggregate the effect of social distancing in general vs. the specific impact of school closures thereafter. It is interesting to note that whilst rhinovirus and adenovirus cases tend to fluctuate with school openings, the rise in RSV cases in July 2021 occurred at the point when schools were closing for the summer holidays. Furthermore, the majority of cases in this study are in pre-school aged children, likely a combination of a true high incidence in this age group (as is usually the case) and a higher likelihood of severe illness in pre-school age children requiring hospital attendance. Therefore paradoxically, the greatest benefit of school closures and lockdown might be reducing community incidence of respiratory viruses and therefore acquisition and hospitalisation in the pre-school age group. An important piece of future work will be to understand which components of the public health interventions were most effective for preventing various respiratory virus infection and hospitalisation in different age groups, in particular understanding the contribution of school closures, given the many negative effects of closing schools on children and on society.
There are several hypotheses exploring the different patterns of resurgence between viral pathogens, including differences in the durability of immunity and the impact of reduced exposures on natural "boosting", respiratory virus "interference" in which one epidemic delays the start or accelerates the end of the other viral epidemic (as was seen in the 2009 influenza pandemic in which the RSV epidemic was also delayed)(36-38), and differences in viral structure (for example the presence of an envelope) or transmission altering susceptibility to social distancing and inactivation by handwashing and surface cleaning.
There were limitations to this study. The retrospective nature of this study is subject to biases in data collection; respiratory diagnoses amongst ED attendees represent the more severe end of the disease spectrum and although these reflect community prevalence (this study shows similar trends to Public Health England surveillance data(39)), they likely over-represent diagnoses in the pre-school children more likely to require hospital care for respiratory infection. Furthermore, some children, for example those with croup who are not conventionally sampled, are not represented in the dataset. Changes in healthcare seeking behaviours during the pandemic impact the calculated rates of infection, for example, families may have been deterred from attending hospital in person during the pandemic due to concerns about exposure to SARS-CoV-2. However this is partly mitigated by presenting respiratory diagnoses per 1000 attendances. The increased incidence of rhinovirus, adenovirus, hCoV and parainfluenza in the pandemic relative to pre-pandemic in this study is likely exaggerated by an ascertainment bias, due to increased use of the more comprehensive Biofire respiratory pathogen panel test for deteriorating patients or those requiring aerosol generating procedures during the pandemic and introduction of quadruple Influenza A/B/RSV/SARS-CoV-2 admission screening in July 2021.
10

Although we have divided the study period into "pandemic" and "pre-pandemic" periods, SARS-CoV-2 circulated in the UK during the early weeks of 2020, defined here as "pre-pandemic". Since not all periods of lockdown are equivalent in terms of stringency, we used the Oxford COVID-19 government response tracker's Stringency Index(24) to indicate the degree of restrictions in place throughout the study. However this stringency index does not capture population adherence to lockdown and social distancing measures.
Further studies, including the `Bronchstart' study(40), will be required to assess the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on respiratory virus incidence in both paediatric and adult populations, to inform workforce planning to adapt to changing seasonal patterns of service demand, altered testing strategies and use of anti-viral prophylaxis in high risk groups. We also need to understand which public health interventions are most effective for different pathogens, and assess whether any ongoing social distancing measures (for example public health messaging about hand washing, social distancing, ventilation and masking) could be useful to reduce the burden of RTI in the long term.

Abstract
Objective
To describe the rapid conceptualization and implementation of an interdisciplinary epilepsy clinic for children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) at Arkansas Children's Hospital (ACH) during the COVID 19 pandemic.
Methods
Focusing on care design and care coordination for children with DRE, multiple stakeholder groups decided to implement a clinic after the systematic rating of constructs present in a theoretical meta-analytic framework. Based on the projected success, the new interdisciplinary clinic (composed of an epileptologist, a neurosurgeon, and a neuropsychologist and coordinated by a full-time nurse) was established. Clinic operations were further refined through discussions with patients, families, and care providers. We collected data retrospectively (August 2020 to June 2021) to determine referral patterns, clinic scheduling metrics, patient characteristics, clinical recommendations, and epilepsy quality metrics.
Results
Of the 32 Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs assessed, 24 were positively rated to predict a high probability of successful implementation of the clinic. For approximately 100 patient visits, appearance and usage rates were >75%, yielding a clinic utilization rate of approximately 60%. Among 76 unique patients (average age of 12 years, 60% focal epilepsy), 39 patients (51.3%) were deemed eligible for epilepsy surgery evaluation. The majority of the patients (53.9%) were advised for additional diagnostic testing, and 31.6% of patients were scheduled for vagus nerve stimulation. More patients (33%) had changes in their existing anti-seizure medication (ASM) regimen rather than an addition of a new ASM (7.9%). Standardized epilepsy quality measures showed >80% to 90% adherence in 3 (reproductive counseling, depression and anxiety screening, documentation of seizure frequency) out of 4 metrics.
Significance
This is the first study to show that an interdisciplinary clinic can be a valuable attribute of care models in high-need children with DRE by enabling comprehensive one-stop service for diagnostic evaluation, surgical consideration, and brief assessment of psychiatric comorbidities without compromising consensus-based best practices.

Introduction
Epilepsy is the costliest and most common chronic neurological condition in children. [1] Although most children with epilepsy have self-limiting and easy-to-control seizures, approximately one third of patients develop drug-resistant epilepsy(DRE). [2] These children with DRE have a high risk of mortality, poor intellectual growth, and development of psychiatric comorbidities. [2]
The Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on the Public Health Dimensions of Epilepsies recommended improving access to a more advanced level of care for patients with DRE, emphasizing the coordination of epilepsy-specific services. [3] Integrated specialist services can significantly help many children with DRE by optimizing medical therapy, adopting dietary therapy, or using neuromodulation and epilepsy surgery. [4] Despite the accumulation of solid evidence of the use of epilepsy surgery and other nonmedical treatment approaches for DRE, these are underutilized due to the need for an expert interdisciplinary team dedicating to conduct all necessary evaluations [detailed history, physical examination, recording of ictal events with simultaneous electroencephalography( EEG) and video monitoring, neuropsychological evaluation, advanced anatomic and functional neuroimaging]. [5,6] This complex workup usually requires multiple outpatient and inpatient visits, all of which became significantly restricted during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A global survey reported that >90% of pediatric neurology services had been affected by restricted outpatient care, decreased access to EEG, limited use of dietary therapy, restricted admission in epilepsy monitoring units, and canceled or limited epilepsy surgery. [7] Although most health care systems worldwide face unique challenges in providing basic epilepsy care with the increasing adoption of telehealth during this time, existing literature does not shed light on how to integrate highly specialized quality epilepsy care, especially when interdisciplinary evaluation and workup was not feasible in a virtual care environment. [8,9,10]
Arkansas Children's Hospital (affiliated with the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences [UAMS] and serves as a teaching hospital with the College of Medicine Department of Pediatrics) is the only pediatric healthcare system in Arkansas. Its comprehensive epilepsy program is the state's only pediatric Level 4 program. As a Level 4 program, ACH is committed to offering complete evaluation and treatment options for epilepsy, including epilepsy surgery. However, providing coordinated and streamlined care for children with DRE has been difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic. These children require multiple clinic visits by various specialists, additional diagnostic tests, and inpatient admission for optimum treatment.

Although a multidisciplinary care model can allow mitigation of stress associated with attending multiple hospital or clinic visits by coordinating management across various disciplines, there is limited knowledge on how to systematically evaluate a local context to decide the appropriateness of clinical service and effectively assess clinic performance to optimize patient access and operational efficiency. There is also a paucity of data regarding various clinical recommendations provided during interdisciplinary complex epilepsy clinics and the quality of epilepsy care using standardized metrics. This paper describes how ACH designed and adapted an integrated complex epilepsy clinic based on a systematic meta-analytic framework analysis during the COVID pandemic and maintained operational efficiency without compromising the quality of epilepsy care.
Methods
Organizational planning and strategy
Since 2017, ACH has successfully used many organizational strategies to expand its epilepsy surgery service. The main challenges for the service expansion were identifying all children with DRE, streamlining workup for these patients, and improving care coordination among disciplines to provide high-quality patient-centered care. In 2020, a neurologist received an Implementation Science/Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) grant to evaluate the epilepsy treatment gap at the ACH. He met with neuroscience leaders to brainstorm solutions for improving epilepsy care and subsequently conducted several group meetings and one-toone semi-structured interviews with 11 individual stakeholders, focusing on care design and care coordination for children with DRE. A meta-analytic theoretical framework, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), was applied for coding the transcribed interview data against 32 constructs of the 5 major domains: characteristics of the clinic (e.g., evidence, strength, quality, complexity), the outer setting (e.g., patient needs and resources), the inner setting (e.g., compatibility of the clinic with the existing epilepsy services, leadership engagement), characteristics of individuals(e.g., stakeholders' attitudes toward the clinic establishment), and the process of implementing the program (e.g., quality and extent of planning, engagement of key stakeholders). [11] A systematic rating process was applied to determine the implementation success of the clinic.[12]
Based on the projected success, a new interdisciplinary clinic (named Complex Epilepsy Clinic or CEC) moderated by a full-time epilepsy nurse coordinator was proposed to evaluate children with DRE to address the unique needs of the population (Figure 1). Barriers and facilitators of the clinic were comprehensively evaluated (Table 1). Finally, the decision was made to move forward with the establishment of the CEC for various reasons: the need for an integrated team to optimally manage children with DRE, demand for efficient means of delivering patient care ('one-stop approach'), improvement in care coordination and patient satisfaction, continuing

education resources for referring physicians, enhancement in collaborative teaching, promotion of research-based disease-specific patient registry, and an upgrade in the expedited treatment approach using nonmedical therapy (including appropriate presurgical diagnostic evaluation via the Epilepsy Surgery pathway for selected patients).
CEC startup
We centralized the clinic's location in the Neuroscience Center to streamline patient visits and improve communication among providers. Rather than separate discussions with various specialists, patients were allowed to discuss treatment options with all relevant specialists available in the clinic room. The interdisciplinary team included an epileptologist (weekly rotation among 5 board-certified physicians), a neurosurgeon, a neuropsychologist, and the nurse care coordinator. Epileptologists were involved to ensure completeness of previous diagnostic evaluation, optimization of medical therapy, and exploration of other appropriate nonpharmacological options. The neurosurgeon was engaged to play a collaborative role in guiding the multidisciplinary conversation about epilepsy surgery and neuromodulation. The neuropsychologist was involved in the rapid assessment of these children's cognitive challenges and psychiatric issues. A dietician, rehabilitation specialist, and social worker contributed on a part-time basis. The team holds a weekly half-day clinic and consults four patients per session.
Patient identification and workflow
Because of the rapid roll-out of the program, 2 strategies were used for patient identification of children with DRE following the definition of the International League Against Epilepsy(ILAE). [13] Neurologists and epileptologists were able to refer patients directly to the clinic by contacting the care coordinator. It was determined that one epileptologist would temporarily take primary responsibility for the potential surgical patients referred by neurologists to complete the remaining diagnostic workup, present the patient's information to the epilepsy surgery conference, facilitate surgical planning with the neurosurgeon, and provide immediate follow-up after surgery. However, the patient would eventually return to the original neurology providers, who would maintain autonomy during the shared decision-making process. [14] To further promote the referral process, the coordinator also used a self-service cohort query tool (Epic Slicer-dicer) to identify all patients with DRE who are scheduled for clinic. [15] She sent weekly reminders to the providers with a list containing potentially eligible patients to allow providers to offer CEC appointments to the willing families during the regular clinic visit. We educated providers about ideal referral candidates, focusing on recognized etiologies and syndromes associated with DRE, such as tumors, mesial temporal sclerosis, cortical dysplasia, hypothalamic hamartoma, and hemispheric syndromes. [16] We also expressly indicated that cases typically perceived as difficult candidates for surgery (e.g., very young age, developmental disabilities, psychiatric issues, lesion overlapping the eloquent cortex, multifocal epilepsy)

would not be a contraindication to referral to this clinic. We encouraged earlier referral for younger patients. Additionally, we considered some patients eligible for the clinic even if they were not formally diagnosed with DRE but had an epilepsy syndrome strongly associated with DRE and were potentially surgically remediable. Some DRE patients were not included in the clinic if they were already receiving coordinated care in another multispecialty clinic, such as tuberous sclerosis, neurogenetics, and neuro-oncology clinics. The CEC medical director met weekly with the care coordinator to discuss new referrals for assessing eligibility and urgency in scheduling patients. The care coordinator scheduled patients for clinic visits, coordinated diagnostic tests, entered patient data in a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database, communicated with the surgical case conference coordinator to present appropriate patients in the conference, talked directly with patients and families assigned to the clinic during office hours, and handled all electronic messages received from these families.
The clinic started operating in August 2020. The cohort of all patients attending the clinic (with at least one visit) was identified from August 2020 to June 2021. We collected data retrospectively from the electronic medical record and the REDCap registry to determine referral patterns, clinic scheduling metrics, patient characteristics, treatment recommendations, and epilepsy quality metrics.
Clinical recommendations and quality of epilepsy care data during the first clinic visit were manually abstracted from the individual charts. Clinical recommendations included noninvasive diagnostic recommendations (e.g., video EEG, neuroimaging, advanced source imaging specific for presurgical evaluation), invasive diagnostic tests (e.g., intracranial monitoring), optimization of medical treatment by either dose change of ASM or addition of a new ASM, recommendations for epilepsy surgery, and recommendations for vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and dietary therapy. Quality of epilepsy care was evaluated by 4 metrics from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 2017 Epilepsy Quality Measurement Set: 1. counseling for women of childbearing potential with epilepsy (percentage of all patients of childbearing potential, 12-44 years old, diagnosed with epilepsy and counseled regarding epilepsy treatment and its effects on contraception and pregnancy in at least 2 of the 3 counseling topics, which include the need for folic acid supplementation, the drug interactions with contraception medication, and potential antiseizure medications effect[s] on fetal/child development and/or pregnancy); 2. depression and anxiety screening for patients >12 years old with epilepsy (percentage of patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy who were screened for depression and anxiety; no specific screening tool was required, but most frequently depression was screened by the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 [PHQ2] and 9 [PHQ-9], and anxiety was screened by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2 [GAD-2] and 7 [GAD-7]; 3. patient visits with current seizure frequency documented for each seizure type; 4. patients >4 years old with age-appropriate condition-specific quality of life assessed (no specific screening tool was required, but most

frequently, Pediatric Epilepsy Learning Healthcare System Quality of Life Questions [PELHSQOL-2] was used). [17] Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the patient population, frequency of various recommendations, and quality of epilepsy care data. [18]
To further optimize clinic functioning, 6 providers and 26 caregivers were interviewed following a semistructured format regarding satisfaction with the services, including the overall quality of the clinic. The caregivers also provided feedback regarding the amount of information given in the clinic, the attitude of the clinic staff, time spent during visits, recommendations for clinic use to other patients, and comfort in contacting clinic staff after the clinic visit. The feedback was used to enhance the effectiveness of the clinical program.
Our project received approval from our ethical standards committee on human experimentation (UAMS Institutional Review Board associated with the Arkansas Children's Hospital) for any experiments using human subjects.
Results
Systematic rating of constructs using CFIR framework
Of 32 CFIR constructs assessed, 24 constructs were positively rated (+1 or +2) to predict a high degree of implementation success of the interdisciplinary clinic (Table 2). Only 7 constructs did not have adequate data or could not be applied in our context. We identified four constructs (cost, cosmopolitanism, compatibility, and external change agents) with the potential to affect the implementation plan negatively. As many stakeholders were concerned about the costs and compatibility of the clinic with the existing workflows, we employed several strategiestemplate modification, close monitoring of scheduling metrics, and employment of a dedicated clinic coordinator- to overcome these concerns during the pre-implementation period. We also actively networked with other organizations and healthcare professionals from other institutes to understand the on-the-ground challenges to run similar clinics and further refined our implementation plan. In summary, the systematic rating process confirmed that stakeholders saw the benefits of establishing this new clinic.
Operational efficiency of the clinic
The clinic scheduling metrics were assessed for the operational efficiency of the clinic (Figure 2). Parameters included, clinic slots eligible to have patients scheduled (total 164 slots available during the study period), slots occupied by appointments (127 scheduled), and slots for which patients attended the associated visit (100 appeared with 76 new visits; 10 no-shows, 17 cancellations). The appearance rate (appeared/scheduled) was calculated as 78.7%, the usage

rate (scheduled/available) as 77.4%, and the utilization rate (appeared/available=usage rate*appearance rate) as 61%.
Demographics
Our population demographics (N=76) showed an average age of 12 years (±5) when presented to the clinic (Table 3). As expected, more than two-thirds of these patients were referred by neurologists. Due to the primary focus on epilepsy surgery, the most common seizure type was intractable focal epilepsy (60%). Still, due to expedited evaluation for other nonmedical therapies, patients with generalized (27.6%) or mixed seizures (9.2%) were also seen in the clinic. The most common etiologies of epilepsy were either structural (34.2%) or genetic (32.9%) in nature.
Clinical recommendations
We reviewed the individual chart of the first CEC visit to screen recommendations (Table 4). A total of 39 patients (51.3%) were deemed eligible for epilepsy surgery evaluation. But most patients did not have enough previous diagnostic workup to proceed to direct intracranial monitoring or epilepsy surgery. Therefore, only 12 (15.8%) patients were recommended for intracranial monitoring (stereo-EEG or subdural grid and strip methods), and an additional 4(5.3%) patients were scheduled for epilepsy surgery. The majority of the patients (41; 53.9%) were advised for further diagnostic testing, and 13(17%) patients benefited from diagnostic bundling (scheduling multiple diagnostic tests in a single session). Although only 5(6.6%) patients were recommended for dietary therapy, 24 (31.6%) patients were scheduled for VNS. Regarding optimization of medical treatment, more patients (25; 33%) had a change in their existing ASM regimen rather than an addition of a new ASM (6; 7.9%).
Quality epilepsy care
Four metrics for assessment of quality epilepsy care showed excellence in documenting seizure type (100% adherence) and reproductive counseling for women of childbearing potential (only 1 out of 19 patients did not meet the criterion for counseling recommendation as her clinic note had documentation of folic acid supplementation but without any mention of potential drug-drug interaction and impact of ASM on the fetus and/or pregnancy) (Table 5). Adherence to anxiety and depression screening was good, but many patients were excluded from the screening due to known active diagnoses of anxiety and/or depression. Finally, the quality of life assessment was only modest, with close to 40% of the charts not having specific screening documentation.

Discussion
This article details the conceptualization and processes that contributed to the rapid organization and implementation of an interdisciplinary clinic for children with DRE. To our knowledge, this is the first study that used a meta-analytic framework (based on Implementation Science theories) to project the successful implementation of a coordinated interdisciplinary epilepsy clinic. The limited use of implementation theories to guide clinical services may be related to the unfamiliarity of the Implementation Science in neuroscience research. However, the typical use of the rapid cycle improvement (Plan-Do-Study-Act model) process can be challenging in situations where prior systematic context analysis for the first implementation process is necessary. [19,20] We utilized a systematic rating process to project high-degree implementation success before carrying out the change process. Using a systematic framework is also beneficial for generating generalizable knowledge for future applicability in diverse real-world contexts, bringing a higher degree of methodological rigor in the clinical investigation compared to traditional quality improvement efforts, and strengthening external validity over time as other centers may use the same framework to estimate probabilities of success or failure of a particular clinical service. [12]
After establishing the clinic, schedule-based analysis was used to provide a framework to assess changes in the clinic operations. For approximately 100 patient visits, appearance and usage rates were >75%, yielding a utilization rate of approximately 60%. Other international and US studies showed similar no-show and cancellation rates in pediatric neurology clinics before the COVID pandemic to suggest a robust clinic efficiency in the middle of this challenging time. [21,22] As previous studies suggested, long distances from the clinic (patients from all over the state traveled to this clinic) and insurance status (Medicaid population) may be responsible for some scheduling inefficiency. [23] A long delay of the appointment time was perhaps not related as most patients were scheduled within 4 weeks of the referral. Though not directly assessed, periodic extreme weather, sickness in patients or caregivers (COVID and other infections), fear of COVID exposure in the clinic, lack of transportation, and transient improvement in seizure control were perhaps associated with some cancellations. Tracking cancellation lag time and trying to schedule another patient in the slot may further improve scheduling efficiency. The patients were reminded about the upcoming visits, from 7 days to 24 hours before the visit, using text messages, phone calls, and email to decrease no-shows related to forgetfulness. We also plan to have the coordinator call families 72 hours before the appointment as some patients did not have the optimum benefit from the clinic because their seizures were already better controlled between the referral and the actual visit in the CEC or they had a recent change in the medical therapy before the CEC visit that required longer follow-up to assess response rather than another change of treatment plan during the clinic visit.

The clinic's establishment was motivated by the desire to expand epilepsy services amid the COVID pandemic. Although the clinic was primarily developed to streamline diagnostic workup to move patients faster toward epilepsy surgery, overtime, the model was adapted to serve patients more comprehensively by medical therapy optimization, completion of the diagnostic tests, the use of alternative nonmedical medical therapies (diet and neuromodulation), and the attention paid to behavioral and cognitive challenges associated with DRE. We had only 4 patients with lesional epilepsy who could proceed directly to surgery based on concordant video EEG and MRI data. As noted in recent studies, the complexity of epilepsy surgery has dramatically increased with a further need for intracranial monitoring and/or advanced noninvasive source imaging before surgery. [24-27] Within a brief period, the clinic facilitated a robust uptake of presurgical evaluation (10-20/year previously to 40/year), intracranial diagnostic procedures (0-5/year to 12/year, and the implantation of neuromodulation devices (10-12/year to 24/year). Other patients with multifocal or generalized epilepsy and children with epileptic encephalopathies benefited from genetic testing (a more defined pathway for genetic testing in the clinic can further improve the workflow), medical therapy, neuromodulation, dietary therapy, and palliative surgery. [16, 28-31] Interestingly, we observed significantly more patients receiving a recommendation for VNS compared to dietary therapy. It is unclear if regular access of a neurosurgeon in the clinic caused a bias recommendation toward VNS. It is also possible that providers refer more patients suitable for VNS to this clinic due to the presence of a neurosurgeon in the clinic. We did not capture information regarding previous or existing dietary therapy, which may have excluded some patients for repeat recommendations about dietary treatment.
Multidisciplinary care is more effective than traditional clinic visits in many disciplines in medicine, including neurology. [32-36] The literature to support interdisciplinary care for many chronic neurological disorders showed its effect on increased adherence to clinical care guidelines, efficient resource utilization, reduced hospital admissions and emergency room visits, improved quality of life, and decreased mortality. [37, 38] For example, a multidisciplinary intervention for Parkinson's disease showed improved quality of life and disease-specific rating scores than standard general neurology care. [39] While the need for an interdisciplinary clinic in children with epilepsy makes intuitive sense, there is a paucity of data in the literature with only some data available related to multidisciplinary transitional clinics for adolescents and patients with psychogenic nonepileptic events. [38,39] In the only previous study of a multidisciplinary clinic of children with DRE, Williams et al described the establishment of the epilepsy clinic with various specialists (pediatric neurologist, nurse practitioners, psychologist, psychology examiner, social worker, educational specialist), assessed the referral patterns, and analyzed the factors predictive of parental satisfaction attending the clinic. [42] However, this study did not specifically evaluate the clinical

recommendations of the clinic visit and did not determine the quality of the epilepsy care. Multidisciplinary discussions are common for intractable patients (especially in the presurgical evaluation), but usually happen in the absence of and with no direct input from the patients during the meeting. [43] The distinct benefit of the interdisciplinary clinic is that epileptologists, neurosurgeons, and neuropsychologists can discuss and review the surgical option with patients and families, in person and from multiple viewpoints, to develop a practical treatment decision in one visit. Epileptologists can give input regarding potential epileptogenic zone, completeness of diagnostic workup, and the probability of seizure freedom. Neurosurgeons can elaborate on the technical limitations and risks of the proposed procedure, and neuropsychologists can discuss the impact of surgery on the behavioral and memory comorbidities. We noted that several patient profiles benefited most from the clinic: 1. children with focal intractable epilepsy with no previous advanced source imaging (e.g., 14 patients scheduled for magnetoencephalography); 2. potential neuromodulation candidates but needing comprehensive review by a multidisciplinary team for evaluation of epilepsy surgery (24 patients scheduled to receive VNS); 3. patients needing bundling of diagnostic tests; and 4. patients needing neuropsychiatric evaluation (other than determining patients who would need detailed assessment, the presence of neuropsychologist was helpful for practical tips for children with learning disorders, autism, and attention deficit hyperactive disorder, and neuropsychologists had more information about the patients directly from the other physicians, which may lead to better neuropsychiatric assessment). In general, both healthcare professionals and families expressed that the interdisciplinary clinic was a highly effective method of evaluating children with DRE, and the combined expertise of the team was estimated to be superior to individual specialists working alone. [44]
We noted >80% to 90% adherence to the 3 out of 4 AAN standardized epilepsy quality measures (updated 2017 version), which were created to improve the delivery of care for patients with epilepsy. [18] This finding was consistent with previous studies (primarily based on the first set of epilepsy measures published in 2009) showing 83% to 94% adherence for providers with high volume exposure to epilepsy patients or additional fellowship training in epilepsy. [45] The adherence rate was much better than that noted in other studies (including our unpublished data from our general neurology clinics, recorded in previous years during divisional audits and quality improvement efforts) involving a broad group of neurologists. [46] However, we had only modest documentation of screening information about healthrelated quality of life. Although physicians consistently documented various components of a patient's life affected by seizures or ASM, specific quality of life scores or screening methods were frequently omitted in the clinic notes. Further quality improvement initiatives (provider education, reminders for documentation, standardized template, structured support tool in the electronic medical record, and electronic data capture with near-time data analysis) to address this gap may allow patients, families, and physicians to identify areas of concern related to poor

quality of life, improve clinical practice, and track trends longitudinally to determine the impact of a new treatment. [45,47-50]
Besides the benefit of interdisciplinary clinics described above, these clinics for intractable epilepsy are ideally disposed to serve as a gateway to clinical research. We created a comprehensive REDCap registry to track clinical outcomes, evaluate adherence to clinical standards, maintain quality care, and follow these patients longitudinally. The availability of a disease-specific registry allowed us to participate in multicenter Pediatric Epilepsy Research Center's collaborative research projects. Additionally, patients and families seeking multidisciplinary care are very motivated to learn about and participate in the research. Finally, the research staff may follow a relatively smaller pool of patients to recruit for the relevant clinical studies (as most epilepsy trials involve patients with DRE).
Despite the rapid implementation of this clinic, many challenges remain, including the unbillable service of the nurse coordinator, who played an essential role in the smooth functioning of the clinic and provided interdependent interaction within and across disciplines. Although not directly assessed, a single-person contact for the clinic allowed easier coordination of tests, consistent tracking of patients, and prompt case presentation for the surgical conference. However, interdisciplinary clinics are expensive to establish and run. Institutional profit may not be higher than the traditional one patient-one doctor model without a significant increase in the downstream revenue. A formal definition and assessment of the quality and value of multidisciplinary care for DRE are increasingly needed, which can justify using a dedicated care coordinator for the clinic. Alternatively, this position may be funded by philanthropic support in the future. Although the clinic reduced the significant travel burden for the families, many patients still had to travel long distances (as CEC was the only such specialized clinic in the state) to come to our clinic. Further improvement in care value is possible by using telehealth without losing the quality of care. [51] However, most families showed hesitancy to substitute in-person visits for telehealth, and many families live in rural areas without the high-speed internet access needed at home to participate in telehealth visits. Improvement in the mobile health technology and establishment of the networked programs (remote health clinics with high-speed internet connections) and point-to-point connections (linking several primary care clinics to our organization, allowing patients to be evaluated from their pediatrician's office) in the future may be helpful in that regard. A further concern would be reimbursement for multidisciplinary video visits. Further expansion of the clinic may also need to optimize community support, involve advocacy groups, and engage families via social media.
The research has several limitations. The clinic cohort has been relatively small so far, and some patient characteristics were not systematically investigated in the study, including seizure

frequency, complete ASM regimen, and the impact of clinic recommendations. We acknowledge that we lack longitudinal follow-up data in the current pilot phase to fully understand the clinic's impact. However, the study has not been primarily designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the interdisciplinary clinic or study healthcare utilization and cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the study focused on the successful implementation of a practice model. Regardless, we will follow these patients long-term to determine clinical outcomes and costeffectiveness of surgery in eligible patients. Moreover, in this cohort, we also did not have a control group for comparison purposes. In the future, children assigned to the interdisciplinary clinic and children receiving regular care can be compared objectively to assess differential outcomes. However, the lack of previous studies related to interdisciplinary epilepsy care may cause problems reaching consensus about definite metrics to track related to patient-centered outcome data to prove the impact of a multidisciplinary clinic.[52] However, we successfully followed several pertinent quality metrics in this cohort to show high-quality care. An additional limitation of the study is that the structure and personnel of the CEC were based on the availability of needed experts. The implementation process is based on a single center and may not be generalizable outside the population. To counteract that, we demonstrated a systematic rating system that other centers could use before implementing a new clinical service; consistent use of this systematic framework may generate robust evidence supporting a particular establishment when rapid improvement cycles are difficult to implement.
In summary, our study suggests that it is feasible to implement an interdisciplinary complex epilepsy clinic at an academic medical center with rapid uptake of comprehensive evaluation and treatment. Throughout the continually evolving pandemic, our clinic provided consistent care for children with DRE with robust utilization. We believe the framework shared here could be adapted for practical implementation in other institutions to provide individualized, specialized, and comprehensive care in children with DRE. With limited previous evidence that interdisciplinary clinics have an impact on the quality of epilepsy care, our study showed care coordination integrated into the care delivery system could be a valuable attribute of care models in high needs children with DRE by enabling comprehensive one-stop service for diagnostic evaluation, surgical consideration, and brief assessment of psychiatric comorbidities and cognition without compromising evidence-based and consensus-based best practices.

specialists

The relative efficacy of the interdisciplinary clinic for the management of epilepsy is unknown

The cost-effectiveness of the intervention is unknown

Time lag to understand the effectiveness of the clinic

External influence over the organization

Reimbursement challenges for the multispecialty clinic

Organization characteristics

Lack of standardized workflow in the clinic
Lack of availability of a dedicated research coordinator and robust technological support

Facilitators Initial EEG data, seizure semiology, brain MRI can be discussed among key clinicians responsible for the particular patient to develop tailored recommendations about further testing to complement the evaluation.
Faster evaluation of the patient in this weekly clinic without waiting for the epilepsy surgical conference, which occurs once every four weeks, and pediatric cases are discussed with adult cases
Potentially allow fewer studies and resources due to the tailored approach to the diagnostic workup and thus may decrease healthcare expenses
Joint discussion and decision making with patients and families
More convenient knowledge sharing among various specialists
More effortless longitudinal follow-up of these children with drug-resistant epilepsy Several other comprehensive epilepsy centers have already established similar clinics.
Sharing experience, brainstorming ideas, and networking opportunities with other similar clinics to successful implementation and expansion of the clinic
Formation of a disease-specific database that can facilitate intramural research and foster multicenter research collaboration, for example, participation in the Pediatric Epilepsy Research Collaboration efforts
Implementation grant awarded to a neurologist for planning and maintenance of the clinic.
Patient preference and wish to get to see all the relevant providers in a single visit
The regular clinic of the assigned epileptologist was blocked for that day to facilitate dedicated time for the clinic
Neuroscience leadership /organizational commitment
Establishment of a REDCap data registry to collect clinical information of these patients to facilitate longitudinal follow-up and assess clinical outcomes

Consensus about the added value of multidisciplinary care

Practice staff and clinicians

The busy workload of specialists, particularly the availability of the neurosurgeon

Constructs with illustrative statements that strongly and positively influenced the implementation
Relative advantage: `That intractable clinic; that's going to help a lot. Before, I wouldn't be quite sure how to send them to somebody other than asking my nurse. Just try to figure out what to do before. So it was a little bit complicated. Now, we have this clinic and I can refer to the clinic coordinator; I think that's going to make things a lot better'. (Neurologist)
Patient Needs & Resources: `It is a huge advantage for the patients to get to see so many specialists in one visit and informed about the plan' (Neuroscience scheduler)
`Does Arkansas have something to offer us? And they start looking go, Oh my God. Yeah, they have this clinic. We should go at least check them out. And those people, when they have good experiences and then they go back to their homes, they then sing your praises and sing the institution's praises to everybody they know, and you start getting more patients from that area'(Neuroscience leader)
Peer Pressure: `Most large centers have multidisciplinary programs that they want to bring in

people from everywhere... Come here and get, you know, high-end specialty diagnostic assessment and treatment' (Epileptologist)
`I think it's a very reachable goal... it would put us into the top tier of some of the busiest places in the country'. (Neuroscience administrator)
`We'll do like a collaborative conference together'(Epileptologist)
Structural Characteristics: `Neuroscience council and physician-nurse dyad is vital to organize this[clinic]'(Neurosurgeon)
Culture: `We collaborate with neurosurgery with so many projects' (Nurse coordinator)
Tension for Change: `I'm interested in quality. I want us to get the clinic right. And as we continue to grow and see more and more patients, several things are going to transpire. One is as a team; we're going to synergize better. We will communicate with each other better'. [Neuroscience leader]
Not just the epileptologists, not just the surgeon, not just the nursing staff, all of us will sync with each other better and better over time, our volumes will increase. So experiences, individual provider's experiences will also go up. And as you see more, you will be more confident about doing more. [Epileptologist]
`"Good fences. Make good neighbors" So I'm happy to be friendly with you [other programs]. I'm happy to collaborate with you. I'm happy to have conferences with you, but I'm not interested referring all patients to you. I prevent that by providing a competitive service. So it's not, it's not by trashing you, it's not by trying to tear down what you're doing. It's by trying to build up a comprehensive service and let the people decide where they want to go'.

BACKGROUND: The Pediatric Anesthesia COVID-19 Collaborative (PEACOC) is a research network to advance the care of children during the pandemic. Here we calculate the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among children undergoing anesthesia, look at prevalence in the population data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and assess independent risk factors for infection. METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study. Children aged 28 days to 18 years scheduled for anesthesia services at 12 centers requiring universal COVID-19 testing from March 29, 2020 to June 30, 2020 were included. COVID-19 positivity rates among those tested were plotted and trends were assessed using the Cochran Armitage test of trend. Independent risk factors were explored using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Data were collected and analyzed on 33,320 anesthesia encounters including 265 children with COVID-19. Over the study period, the rates of infections in the pediatric anesthesia population did not demonstrate a significant trend. In the general population, there was a significant downward trend in infection rates (P < .001). In exploratory analysis, multivariable risk factors for a COVID-19 positive test were Black/African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status III or above, overweight and obese body mass index (BMI), orthopedic cases, abdominal cases, emergency cases, absence of injury and trauma, and West region (all P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of COVID-19 in pediatric anesthesia patients were consistently lower than in the general population. Independent risk factors of a positive test for children were identified. This is the first time universal testing for a single infectious disease was undertaken on a wide scale. As such, the association of infection with surgical case type or emergency case status is unprecedented. (Anesth Analg 2022;00:00-00)

Prevalence of COVID-19
· Findings: We found that the prevalence of COVID-19 was low among pediatric patients presenting for anesthesia. Risk factors for infection included Black/African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status III or above, overweight and obese body mass index (BMI), orthopedic cases, abdominal cases, and emergency cases.
· Conclusions: Rates of COVID-19 were very low in this early phase of the pandemic. Nine independent risk factors for infection were identified, and this is the first time surgical case type or emergency case status has been associated with COVID-19.
GLOSSARY ASA = American Society of Anesthesiologists; BMI = body mass index; CDC = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; CI = confidence interval; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019; ER = emergency room; HCUP = Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project; MCAR = missing completely at random; OR = odds ratio; PEACOC = Pediatric Anesthesia COVID-19 Collaborative; PPE = personal protective equipment; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; STROBE = Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology; WHO = World Health Organization

In late 2019, a new viral illness causing severe disease was putting stress on the medical systems in Wuhan, China.1 By January 2020, cases were detected in 18 countries outside of China, including the United States, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, the organization's highest level of alarm.2 The Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named the new virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)3 in March 2020 and by the end of the month, there were cases in all 50 states.4 The WHO named the disease caused by this novel virus coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a statement on March 18, 2020 to delay indefinitely elective surgical procedures5 to preserve limited personal protective equipment (PPE) and prepare for a surge of patients. Only trauma surgery, cases addressing threat to life, limb or eyesight, urgent cancer surgery, and organ transplants were allowed to proceed.6 Most hospitals in the country developed policies to test all surgical patients for COVID-19 to assess both clinical risk and risk to health care workers in aerosol generating procedures, such as intubation.
During these early days of the pandemic, the risk of COVID-19 to children was unclear. Expedient politicians minimized the risk to children, alarming most health care professionals.7 Testing was limited, making assessment of risk to the pediatric population difficult. However, children undergoing surgery were tested. This offered a unique dataset of results in children who were tested regardless of symptomatology.
PEdiatric Anesthesia COvid-19 Collaborative (PEACOC) is a perioperative pediatric COVID-19 outcomes research network of academic centers. In the present study, we aim to calculate the prevalence of COVID-19 among children presenting for anesthesia services and to calculate positive rates in publicly

available population data. We then propose to look at demographic and clinical features associated with positive test results in the pediatric cohort. Our aim is to quantify the infection burden on our population, compare it to publicly available population data and identify risk factors for infection.
METHODS Ethics Institutional review board (IRB) approval or exemption was achieved locally at each participating medical center using the Oregon Health & Science University protocol as a standard. The requirement for written informed consent was waived by the IRB at all centers. Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines were followed.8 Outcomes were defined and established a priori at initiation of the study design. Statistical analysis and reporting adhered to the SAMPL Guidelines. Individual institutions (Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table 1, http://links.lww.com/AA/E50) began contributing data following approval by local institutional review boards or equivalents. Study data were collected and managed at the Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Oregon Health & Science University. Individual institutions were not identifiable and were represented using an institution code only.
Population Anesthesia records were extracted from electronic medical records using a standardized protocol. Anesthesia encounters for children ages 28 days to 18 years from March 29 to June 30, 2020 were included. All encounters with testing were included, even if the procedure was canceled. Both polymerase chain reaction and antigen detection technology were accepted. All patients were tested in the context of their hospital encounter within 72 hours of an anesthetic. For patients admitted to the centers, through the emergency room (ER) for instance, the

test was administered as part of the preoperative workup. If a patient was transferred from an ER of another hospital with a documented test result, the COVID test was not repeated so long as the test was within 72 hours of the procedure. If the surgical procedure needed to be performed and there was no test result, patients were tested during or just after their anesthetic and they were managed as a COVID-positive patient until definitive results were available. All centers had a protocol in place for universal testing. Data were collected from a given center starting on the date universal testing of anesthesia patients began at that center. Anesthesia encounter dates were coded by week, with each week representing a prevalence point. Data collected included state of residence, age, sex, race, ethnicity, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, procedure, diagnosis, weight, height, and ambulatory or emergency procedure status. Emergency status was determined from the anesthesia billing designation of ASA physical status, ASA physical status IIIE for instance. For centers where this billing data were not available, emergency status was determined by the urgency of the case booking based on the severity of the disease process and the speed of predicted deterioration.
Statistical Analysis Data were rigorously validated, cleaned, and coded according to a standard codebook. Body mass index (BMI), expressed in kg/m2, was calculated from height and weight for children >2 years of age, then converted to z scores based on age and sex using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth reference and the Zanthro add on package for Stata software9 (version 16.1, StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX). The z scores were used to generate BMI percentiles and children were categorized per the CDC definitions as underweight (<5th percentile), normal weight (5-85th percentile), overweight (85-95th percentile), and obese (>95th percentile). Diagnoses were queried for diseases in 4 binary categories: circulatory, including diseases of the heart and circulatory system; respiratory, including respiratory diseases; injury, including injury and trauma; and neoplastic, representing cancers and neoplasms. This was accomplished using groupers adapted from Clinical Classifications Software Refined from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) of the federal Agency for Healthcare and Research and Quality.10 Procedures were categorized manually using groupers derived and created from the body of cases done by participating centers. Chest cases included cardiac and respiratory procedures; abdomen cases included general abdominal surgery, urology, and gynecology; head and neck included otolaryngology, oral surgery, dental, and ophthalmology; orthopedics included surgery on joints, tendons, bones, and spine for scoliosis; neurosurgery included intracranial procedures, vagal

nerve stimulators, spine for unstable cervical spine, cord, or disk. Sedation for radiology included sedations for computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine, positron emission tomography. Other included procedures in soft tissue, multisite, echocardiography, central venous access, lumbar puncture, and bone marrow biopsy. Procedures performed in interventional radiology were classified according to the nature of the procedure and the anatomy in question. For instance, a cecostomy tube exchange was considered an abdominal procedure, whereas a thoracentesis was considered a chest procedure. Geographic analysis utilized regions defined by the United States Census.11
Prevalence of COVID-19 among anesthesia patients was calculated as a straight ratio: number of positive cases divided by the total tested. Incident cases of COVID-19 infections were collected from publicly available data published by the CDC.12 These were expressed as a ratio of positive cases divided by total tests. The CDC data tracker was constantly updated. For consistency, all data were therefore downloaded on a single day, October 18, 2021.
Weekly positive test rates were plotted separately for the study and general populations and trends over the study period were assessed using the Cochran Armitage test for trend.13 Case-level data were presented for positive and negative cases. All categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages. The 2 test or Fisher exact test were implemented for univariate comparisons between positive and negative cases. Fisher exact test was implemented where observed counts for a given variable were <10 within a given category. In this exploratory analysis, all variables were included in a multivariable logistic regression model for determining independent risk factors of a positive test, with results reported as adjusted odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and P values.14 A sensitivity analysis was implemented while excluding patients with missing data on race. A forest plot was constructed for significant multivariable COVID-19 risk factors in exploratory analysis. A 2-tailed P < .05 was used as the criterion for statistical significance in this exploratory analysis. Stata software (version 16.1, StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX) was utilized for statistical analyses. Based on the number of positive test events and nonevents among our pediatric study population, the study had 80% power to detect an OR of 1.38 and 90% power to detect an OR of 1.44 using logistic regression with a 2-tailed  level of .05 (PASS software version 15, NCSS LLC, Kaysville, UT).

inconclusive and therefore excluded, leaving 33,320 for analysis (Table 1). Patients represented 12 centers, 44 states, and the District of Columbia. There were 116 international patients. The prevalence among pediatric anesthesia patients over the entire study period was 0.79%. Publicly available population data from the CDC demonstrated a significant downward trend from 18.8% to 7% over the study period, whereas the pediatric anesthesia data were comparatively flat going from 1% to 1.7% (Figure 1A, B).
Regional Variation in Positive COVID-19 Test Rates The rates of positive cases varied by region (Figure 1C). The West and Midwest were relatively flat. The Northeast had a steep decrease in the early weeks, starting at 5.6% and tapering to zero. In contrast, the South started at 1.4%, stayed flat during the study period, and showed a steep increase to 3% by the end of the study period.
Emergency Cases The proportion of cases classified by emergent case status decreased over the course of the study (Figure 1D). This downward trend was statistically significant going from a peak of 22% in the week beginning April 5, 2020, to a steady 5% during the last 5 weeks of the study period (P < .001).
Risk Factors for COVID-19 On univariate analysis, race, ethnicity, ASA, procedure type, BMI category, ambulatory status, emergency status, circulatory disease, respiratory disease, and region were all associated with positive status (Table 2). In an exploratory multivariable logistic regression model including all variables, Black/ African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, ASA physical status III or above, overweight and obese BMI, orthopedic cases, abdominal cases, emergency cases, absence of injury and trauma, and West region were independently associated with positivity (P < .05; Table 3, Figure 2). In a sensitivity analysis using multivariable logistic regression excluding patients with missing or unknown race, significantly higher adjusted odds of COVID-19 infection was found for Black/African American race as compared to White race (adjusted OR = 2.96; 95% CI = 1.58-5.55; P = .001).
DISCUSSION COVID-19 prevalence among pediatric anesthesia patients was lower than in the general population. We identified 9 independent risk factors for infection.
Prevalence On analysis of 33,320 pediatric anesthesia encounters, the rate of COVID-19 was low at 0.79%. It was

lower than the general population throughout the study period. This is consistent with de Lusignan et al,15 who found that children aged 0 to 17 years had a lower infection rate, 4.6%, than any adult age group (12.6%-19.5%) between February and March 2020.
Societal factors may have contributed. The lowest rates of infection in our data set fell between April 5 and June 20, 2020, corresponding tightly to the dates of school closures. All US schools were closed by April 5.16 This is consistent with Kaufman et al,16 who demonstrated that interventions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including school closures,

Figure 1. Trend in COVID-19-positive cases among pediatric anesthesia patients and the general population data from the CDC data. A, COVID-19-positive test results in pediatric anesthesia patients. Pediatric rates were relatively flat over the study period, going from 1% to 0.5% the week of May 10th and rising to 1.7%. B, COVID-19-positive test results in the general population. Publicly available population data from the CDC are plotted. The general population data began at 18.8%, reached a nadir at 4.2% the week of June 7th, and increased to 7% by study end. C, COVID-19-positive test rates showing regional variation. The Northeast had the highest rates during the beginning of the pandemic and decreased to zero by study end. In contrast, the South saw a steep rise in cases in the last 2 weeks of the study. The Midwest and West were relatively flat throughout. D, Ratio of cases performed under emergency status. Proportion of emergency cases trended downward from 22% to 5% over the study period. This trend was statistically significant (P < .001) and was largely driven by the restart of elective case schedules.

resulted in fewer infections and deaths. Further, we found regional variation (Figure 1C). The West and Northeast had higher rates overall (Table 2; Figure 1C), but the South saw a steep increase in the last weeks of the study. This corresponds temporally to the loosening of public health restrictions and suggests that state policy, such as mask mandates, indeed had an effect on infection rates.16,17
Clinical and Demographic Risk Factors This is the first study describing risk factors of COVID-19 infection in pediatric patients undergoing surgery. Our analysis reveals that patients undergoing abdominal and orthopedic procedures were at higher

risk (Table 3; Figure 2). This may be due to the proportion of fractures and appendectomies. Both comprise generally healthy children who become acutely ill. They are active in their communities just before illness, which may put them at greater risk.
Children undergoing emergency surgery were at higher risk. This was surprising given that elective cases that were canceled due to COVID-19 were captured in our dataset. Bailey et al18 found that children tested in an emergent setting were at increased risk, but do not specify why the children were tested. Presumably, a large proportion was tested for viral or respiratory symptoms. We know that patients in the present study were not tested for symptoms, rather

in the context of an anesthetic. Yet, we too saw the association with that emergency context. As the elective surgeries resumed and the percentage of emergency cases decreased, the risk of COVID-19 actually increased in our data set. After April 26, 2020, emergency cases made up fewer than 10% of cases, but the children who presented with COVID-19 rose from a nadir of 0.5% the week of May 10th to 1.7% by the end of June (Figure 1A, D).

Figure 2. Forest plots depicting 9 significant independent risk factors for positive COVID-19 test. In exploratory analysis, multivariable risk factors for a COVID-19-positive test were Black/African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, ASA physical status III or above, overweight and obese BMI, orthopedic cases, abdominal cases, emergency cases, absence of injury and trauma, and West region (all P < .05). Of these, Black/ African American race (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.43-4.78) and Hispanic ethnicity (OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.62-5.01) had the highest adjusted OR. ASA indicates American Society of Anesthesiologists; BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio.

emergency surgeries proceed before the COVID-19 results are determined. Knowing that the emergency nature of a case increases the risk of infection can help direct clinical management. Universal testing created a unique opportunity to look for patterns for COVID19 infection among surgery types and case urgency. As such, this is the first time emergency case status has been associated with the prevalence of an infectious disease.
We identified factors independently associated with infection in our study population. These were Black/ African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, increased BMI meeting overweight or obese criteria and ASA physical status III or higher (Table 3; Figure 2). Other studies similarly found that Black/African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, severe disease, and obesity were associated with a higher risk.18-21 However, we found that merely overweight children were at a near 2-fold higher risk as well. Unlike previously published work, we did not find that Asian race or older children were at higher risk.18,20,22 Adult data demonstrated that male sex, Black/African American race, and increased BMI were associated with higher rates of infection.15 We did not find that men were at increased risk, consistent with other pediatric studies,18,20 suggesting that the higher risk for men is conferred in adulthood.
None of the 4 disease categories demonstrated a higher risk of infection. This is in contrast to previous work finding higher infection rates in patients with malignancy, cardiac disease, and others.18

Interestingly, there is no evidence in any literature that patients with respiratory disease, such as asthma, are at higher risk for infection.23 Patients with a diagnosis of injury or trauma actually had a lower risk of COVID-19. We suspect that true emergent trauma cases were washed out by other diseases included in this category by HCUP, such as wound infections. The difference between our findings and those of more general pediatric data may be due to the fundamental difference in our population. Here we evaluate children in preparation for surgery and anesthesia, whose risk profile is different than in the general pediatric population.
Study Limitations Study limitations include a lack of a comparable population of anesthesia patients to compare to our pediatric population. We rely on publicly available data of incident cases in the general population. Despite the sample size, we are underpowered to detect differences among individual states or Native American, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders. The multicenter sampling allows for data from all geographic regions throughout the country; however, it is not a sample chosen randomly. The exploratory univariate and multivariable analysis included many variables, which may lead to type I error inflation due to multiple testing. The data included a substantial amount of missing data, especially for patient race. The missing data may not be missing completely at random (MCAR) which introduces bias; however,

the difference reported by race between White versus Black or African American were observed in multivariable exploratory analysis with unknown/missing included as a category.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This is the first study examining children who were tested for to assess risk for anesthesia and surgery. We compare our pediatric population to the general population. Identifying risk factors can guide clinical decisions. This work prompts additional questions. The underlying reasons for differences by surgical case type warrant further investigation. Work by the PEACOC Research Network to assess the risk of COVID-19 infection on pediatric surgical outcomes is

RESEARCH
Exit strategies from lockdowns due to COVID-19: a scoping review
Madhavi Misra1*, Harsha Joshi1, Rakesh Sarwal2 and Krishna D. Rao3

Open Access

Abstract
Introduction: In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, countries have adopted various degrees of restrictive measures on people to reduce COVID-19 transmission. These measures have had significant social and economic costs. In the absence of therapeutics, and low vaccination coverage, strategies for a safe exit plan from a lockdown are required to mitigate the transmission and simultaneously re-open societies. Most countries have outlined or have implemented lockdown exit plans. The objective of this scoping review is to (a) identify and map the different strategies for exit from lockdowns, (b) document the effects of these exit strategies, and (c) discuss features of successful exit strategies based on the evidence.
Methods: A five-step approach was used in this scoping review: (a) identifying the research question and inclusion/ exclusion criteria; (b) searching the literature using keywords within PubMed and WHO databases; (c) study selection; (d) data extraction; (e) collating results and qualitative synthesis of findings.
Results: Of the 406 unique studies found, 107 were kept for full-text review. Studies suggest the post-peak period as optimal timing for an exit, supplemented by other triggers such as sufficient health system capacity, and increased testing rate. A controlled and step-wise exit plan which is flexible and guided by information from surveillance systems is optimal. Studies recommend continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing, use of facemasks, and hygiene measures, in different combinations when exiting from a lockdown, even after optimal vaccination coverage has been attained.
Conclusion: Reviewed studies have suggested adopting a multi-pronged strategy consisting of different approaches depending on the context. Among the different exit strategies reviewed (phase-wise exit, hard exit, and constant cyclic patterns of lockdown), phase-wise exit appears to be the optimal exit strategy.

Background The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for infecting 362 million people. Around 5.6 million people have lost their lives [1]. To mitigate the effects of this pandemic, most countries have implemented

various degrees of population movement restrictions. This has involved closing borders, closing non-essential workplaces and schools, restrictions on gatherings and movements of people (road, air, sea). Some of the mitigation strategies ranged from complete lockdown as seen in India [2] to moderate strategies like in the United Kingdom supported by increased testing, tracing, and quarantining [3]. Other mitigation measures included age-selective distancing. For instance, in New Zealand and South Africa, the older population and those with co-morbidities were recommended to be isolated at

home, while the younger population were allowed to go to work [4].
These restrictive measures have significant social and economic consequences, especially in low income, and low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). These measures adversely affected the disadvantaged population as it led to the shutdown of economic activities, loss of employment, disruption in education, challenges in access to essential health services and other public services, including food insecurity [5]. There is, therefore, a need to exit from lockdowns while simultaneously mitigating the COVID-19 transmission. In the absence of therapeutics and a significant vaccination coverage, a situation that is commonly seen in many LMICs, there is a need for strategies for a safe exit from the restriction measures.
To circumvent the challenges faced following the lockdowns, countries have attempted to devise optimal strategies to exit from lockdowns. Many countries have defined graded exit plans with each phase informed by triggers such as case numbers, infection rate, health system capacity, etc. Other countries have relied on seroprevalence studies and increased testing prior to opening up. The phase-wise exit plans are usually structured by type of business, school, and size of gatherings, etc. The timing and containment measures during exit also varied. Almost all exit strategies studied suggest the continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs- These include physical distancing, use of face mask, and hygiene measures, and other restrictive measures such as stay at home, school closures, travel restrictions, border closures, and steps to address ventilation measures especially in closed spaces) in various combinations suited to country contexts. Countries such as New Zealand and South Korea began relaxing restrictions only after the number of new daily cases reached almost zero. Austria began implementing its exit plan when the daily caseload fell below 100, so the health system wasn't overwhelmed [4]. However, many countries have opted to open up when transmission rates were falling, but had significant

daily case numbers. Therefore, measures for containing the spread of disease need to be in place while opening, to avoid the health system from being overwhelmed by another wave.
The objective of this scoping review is to systematically document the evidence regarding exit strategies related to COVID-19 lockdowns. This scoping review has the following specific aims: (a) to identify and map the different strategies that have been adopted by countries, and are suggested from modelled scenarios of exit from COVID-19 related lockdowns, (b) document the effects of these exit strategies, and (c) discuss features of successful exit strategies based on the available evidence.
Countries are at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. While increasing vaccination coverage is a global goal, many countries have not been able to achieve this due to constraints related to vaccine availability and affordability. With new variants emerging such as Omicron in November 2021, some countries responded with a knee-jerk reaction of imposing travel bans and strict lockdowns [6, 7]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has criticized travel bans, as they affect lives and livelihoods more than the spread of virus [8]. Planning how best to exit from lockdowns is an important policy and public health decision. Depending on the local health system capacity, ongoing calibration of restriction measures is required. There is limited evidence so far on the effects of different exit strategies and findings from this scoping review can guide countries in identifying optimal exit strategies.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria This scoping review was based on searches conducted on the PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and WHO (https://www.who.int) databases in the interest of time (Electronic search strategy for PubMed database provided as Additional file 1). The inclusion criteria for the search included studies from all countries and the time frame was the start of the pandemic in

2020 till May 2021 (refer to Table 1 on PICOS framework). The most recent electronic database search was conducted on 7th June 2021. Full-length, peerreviewed and pre-print literature available in the English language related to exiting from a lockdown/ opening from a lockdown/ removal of lockdowns was included. All clinical studies including drug trials, hospital-based studies, and vaccine efficacy studies were excluded.
Data synthesis After removing the duplicates, two reviewers (MM and HJ) independently examined the abstracts and selected 197 articles for full-text review. Ninety articles were removed as they did not match inclusion criteria as per PICOS and 107 articles were retained for the review. The exclusions after full-text review were discussed among the two reviewers. Data from the included articles were extracted in an excel sheet under pre-populated themes on the timing of exit, determinants for exit, process of exit, components of exit strategy, and

effects of opening up. Qualitative synthesis of findings was undertaken and reviewed by all four authors (MM, HJ, RS and KR).
Results
Search outcomes The search yielded 555 articles using keywords such as Covid, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), exiting from lockdown, and exit strategies. We found 406 unique studies combining both databases and after reviewing the abstracts and full-text review, retained 107 studies as a part of this review (refer to Fig. 1 on study selection flow chart).
Description of the included studies Of the 107 studies, 98 (91.5%) were original research studies, seven (6.5%) were reviews and two (2%) were policy papers. Of the 98 original research studies, 82 studies (84%) were based on mathematical modelling, and 16 (16%) were observational studies (refer to Fig. 2 on types of studies found).

Fig.2 Types of studies included in the review

The majority of the studies (68%) were from highincome countries (as per the World Bank classification of countries by income, accessed from https://datahelpdesk. worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world- bank-country-and-lending-groups), about 18% of studies were based in middle-income countries and only two studies were based in low-income countries. The review found eleven studies (11%) that had used global databases.
Types of exit strategies and their effects Based on the review, we have identified the following key themes to describe an exit strategy (refer to Table 2).
1. Timing of exit- Here the focus is on pre-requisites for opening up after lockdown and determinants for deciding the timing of exit.
2. Process of exit- This section covers strategies adopted to exit from lockdown and the effect they have had on COVID-19 outcomes.
3. Supporting conditions for exit strategies- This section reports on the types of public health measures for containment, and use of NPIs during exit from lockdown.

1. Timing of the exit
Post peak period reducing number of cases and better health system capacity Two review articles based on global data [9, 10] observe that most countries have opted for opening during the `post-peak period'. In this period, a plateauing of cases and hospital admissions are maintained for 2 weeks, implying that the health system can cater to the cases without a crisis. However, this approach risks the formation of new clusters, triggering the next wave of the pandemic, as most of the population is likely not exposed yet to the virus. A strong surveillance system to classify the epidemiological situation is required during the post-peak period. Petersen et al. [10] have adopted the WHO guideline to classify new cases in the postpeak period as imported (from other countries), part of a known cluster, or those with an unknown source.
An article [9] has highlighted that governments need to take into account individual healthcare, economic and social considerations while deciding on the timing of opening, emphasizing that context is important. A policy paper

[4] has summarized various triggers to determine the timing for exiting from lockdowns such as (a) health system capacity (number of beds, equipment available), (b) health system demand (e.g. ICU admissions), (c) death rate (e.g. New York's plan to ease restrictions after 14days continuous fall in death rate), (d) mode of transmission (New Zealand's plan explicitly relates easing levels with change in the mode of transmission- to households only), and (e) costbenefit analysis. Cuschieri [11] has described Malta's experience of reopening from the COVID-19 lockdown where the government considered gradual relaxation of lockdown when the `Reproduction number' (R- The effective reproductive number is the average number of secondary cases per infectious case in a population made up of both susceptible and non-susceptible hosts. If R>1, the number of cases will increase, such as at the start of an epidemic, and where R<1 there will be a decline in the number of cases [12])' went below one. Raje et al. [13] have found crossover time point (when the case recovery rate is greater than case active rate) as an effective trigger to initiate relaxation of restrictions, based on country experiences. Importance

of an evidence-based approach for the timing of exit, which takes into account prevalence and spread of the disease has been advocated in several studies [14, 15].
Findings from modelling studies are corroborated by empirical studies (refer to Table 3). These studies demonstrate the postponing of restrictions, farther beyond the peak may have additional benefits in reducing the number of cases. A US based [16] and an India-based [17] modelling study shows benefits of prolonged removal of restrictions possibly due to progressive exhaustion of the infectious pool in the population.
Findings from an Italy-based modelling study [18] suggest that the stricter the period of lockdown, the longer it might take to exit from the lockdown. In this scenario of a strict lockdown, the subsequent wave is anticipated to be stronger as well. Similarly, if the lockdown is lifted before reaching the peak of the COVID-19 cases, the next wave of cases will have a sharper peak. Studies based

· Early relaxation of NPIs before sufficient immunity has been achieved can lead to a larger wave of infection · If all restrictions are removed only after the entire adult population has been offered two doses (assuming vaccine provides 85% protection against infection), there will still be a next infection wave. (Except, when vaccine uptake is 95, 90, and 85% in those aged 80years and older, 50-79years, and 18-49years, respectively)

in different contexts [18-20] have modelled scenarios of premature exit and demonstrated the risk of sharper and rapid infection peaks.
Another modelling study from Italy [21] hypothesized that the true number of infected cases and relative testing capacity are better determinants to guide lockdown exit strategies. It concludes that decisions on opening should be taken at the local/regional level based on capacity to identify new cases and social contacts. Based on a modelling exercise on data from different regions of Italy, local testing capacity was suggested to be more than 16 times the estimated true number of newly infected cases if a decision to re-open is to be taken. Sufficient health system capacity to cater to stable daily cases was emphasized as a determining factor for opening up [23].
Vaccination coverage/immunity Vaccines to protect from COVID-19 are now an important part of the exit strategy. Moore et al. [22] estimate the effects of vaccination coverage and lifting of restrictions in the UKbased modelling study. The study finds future waves of infection and deaths can be reduced by increasing levels of vaccine-derived immunity in the population. Early relaxation of NPIs before sufficient immunity has been achieved can lead to a larger wave of infection. Furthermore, the study adds vaccination alone cannot bring R below one, and control the epidemic. As per the modelling exercises, with assumptions of vaccine offering 85% protection against the infection and vaccine uptake above 75%, R would reduce to 1.58, which is still greater than the required value of below one. Therefore, NPIs such as face masks, physical distancing, and hygiene measures are required, even after the adult population is fully vaccinated and a stricter lockdown has been lifted.
2. Process of exit Thirty-six studies in the review examined different processes of exit- a) phase-wise/progressive/gradual, b) hard exit (resuming all activities at one time), c) cyclic exit (short cycles of opening and closing) and, d) zonal lockdowns (containment in clusters). The majority of studies have identified phase-wise exit as the most appropriate strategy (refer to Table 4).
Six studies [24-29] included comparisons of different exit strategies. Out of these, four studies [24, 26, 28, 29] compared hard exit with gradual exit and concluded gradual exit to be effective. One study [25] compared zonal strategy with cyclic strategy and concluded zonal

strategy to be effective in LMIC settings. The sixth study [27] was inconclusive about the findings.
Findings related to the process of exit from the select studies have been listed in Table 5.
Phasewise Studies done in Belgium [30, 31, 38], Germany [32], US [33], Netherlands [39], Spain [40], and India [34, 35] show evidence for a phase-wise opening. A study from Germany [41] suggests phase-wise opening should be reversible (i.e., if the reproduction number- R starts going up, the lockdowns can be easily re-imposed) and be pilot tested for four-eight weeks before complete opening up of all restrictions.
Cyclic/rolling lockdown
· To get to an optimal exit strategy, a study from Germany [37] suggests repetitive or rolling lockdowns for up to two-three years by which time herd immunity is reached as this would keep the R under one. This study suggests policymakers must weigh the extent of restrictions against the economic consequences. The conflict between health protection and economic interests needs reconciliation while opening from the lockdown.
· Another modelling study from France [36] proposes a cyclic or a zig-zag schedule of four-day work and 10-day lockdown which can prevent a resurgence and also provide part-time employment. This strategy suggests a drastic, cautionary, or a relaxed approach to lockdowns that must be supported by strict implementation of NPIs (hand hygiene, face mask use, physical distancing, and testing, contact tracing, and quarantine).
· These studies suggest considering economic and social costs before implementing a cyclic or rolling lockdown which has logistic challenges. They caution that periodic lockdown and openings do not lead to herd immunity. Transitioning from one phase to the next is made after measuring the impact of deconfinement by estimating the daily R.

Determinants Based on the daily number of new hospitalizations and admissions to the ICU.
Regular re-assessment is crucial to adjust to evolving behavioural changes that can affect epidemic diffusion. In addition to social distancing, sufficient capacity for extensive testing and contact tracing is essential for successful mitigation. Long duration of remaining restrictions would increase relative economic costs compared to alternative gradual opening strategies Sustained public social distancing and mask wearing, targeting transmission reduction rather than removing susceptible altogether, to reduce R.

(Policy paper- overview)

Zigzag strategy of alternating between periodic and moderate deconfinement. The period should remain small compared to the time needed to reach the peak of the epidemic if deconfinement is maintained (which is in the order of 4 to 5months). A periodic deconfinement is equivalent to a weekly organized deconfinement with 3 and a half days of strict lockdown per week. Scenarios alternating strict lockdown and moderate deconfinement can allow the epidemic to be brought under control without resorting to group immunity.
Repetitive short-term contact reductions. Such reductions can be triggered adaptively if death rates, need for ICU, etc. exceed a threshold. With additional hygienic measures, the situation can be enhanced further. However, repetitive shortterm lockdowns and hygiene measures need to be in place for the next two or three years until herd immunity can be obtained (if vaccination is not available before).
Zonal or local lockdowns may be suitable for some countries where systematic identification of new outbreak clusters in real-time would be feasible

The effects of antibody tests would add significant benefit to exclude people with antibodies from the contact reductions.
Requires generalised testing and surveillance structure, and a well-thought-out (and executed) zone management plan.

Moderate deconfinement with strong but non-drastic interventions, whether gradual or sudden, can lead to a rapid resumption of the epidemic, with a saturation of intensive care units in the fall and a peak of the epidemic in winter.

Zonal lockdown [25]
· Zonal lockdowns are local lockdowns where specific `hotspots' have a sudden outbreak cluster (high number of cases) which have been identified in real-time. Such clustered social distancing works by dividing the population into "zones" according to the geospatial distribution. The disease clusters are contained within these zones so that interactions within a zone are significantly greater than interactions between them. An India-based study [42] suggests that containment zones with a higher case-load should remain even during the exit phase.
· Although effective in developed countries, a study based in LMICs [25] suggests zonal lockdowns with the relaxation of restrictions in remaining places has challenges in LMIC, due to the absence of large-scale population surveillance system and limited testing facilities.
A modelling study [28] compared the effectiveness of different types of exit strategies- hard exit, progressive exit, and cyclic exit (2 weeks of lockdown and 2 weeks of opening over four cycles) and maintaining status quo. Evolution of the Rt (effective reproduction number at a particular time is the expected number of new infections caused by an infectious individual in a population where some individuals may no longer be susceptible [12]) values for the four exit strategies modelled for Luxembourg, Italy, and Japan found that progressive exit offered better outcomes in terms of little impact on the economy and reduced number of cases. A Singapore-based study [43] concludes the effectiveness of gradual relaxation in flattening the curve compared to a sudden resumption of social interactions.
3. Supporting conditions for exit strategies Steps supporting the exit strategy and facilitating its successful implementation include public health (these include testing, contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, and surveillance), pharmaceutical (such as treatment, drug therapies, and vaccination), and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs- these include physical distancing, use of face masks, and hygiene measures). Other restrictive NPIs such as stay at home, school closures, travel restrictions, border closures, and steps to address ventilation measures especially in closed spaces are implemented in varying degrees depending upon the number of cases). This review is focused on public health and NPIs as measures of exiting from a lockdown.

Health system and public health capacity Along with ensuring physical distancing and reducing contacts to control the transmission, the purpose, and justification for lockdowns have been to strengthen the capacity of health systems. This would include not only the facility level capacity, but also the public health capacity in terms of testing, tracing, quarantine and isolation.
a) Testing and surveillance
In the studies reviewed [10, 17, 24, 44-52], upscaling the antigen testing capacity is identified as a critical requirement while planning for exiting the lockdown. Countries that implemented testing at an early stage along with tracing and quarantine could effectively control the spread of COVID-19. For example, South Korea relied on `trace, test and treat' strategy to control the epidemic without imposing nationwide lockdown [53]. This implies the need for extensive testing capacity before considering reopening (refer to Table 6).
Review articles [10, 24, 48, 49, 51] included in this scoping review have emphasized the need for greater access to testing to allow the identification of new cases and clusters as early as possible. Massive testing of the healthy and infected population would be essential to inform policymakers about the effect of interventions during reopening.
Modelling studies included in the review [17, 21, 45-47, 54-57] have identified different effective testing strategies (listed in Table 6) to support opening, post lockdown.
Randazzo et al. [58] used wastewater surveillance and wastewater-based epidemiology to estimate the presence and prevalence of COVID-19 in communities. Findings suggest environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities as a tool for mapping high-risk areas during exit. Digital technology has been suggested for large-scale surveillance [59] and monitoring of epidemic [60] to support exit strategies in the reviewed studies.
b) Contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation
Improved health systems and public health capacity for contact tracing and ensuring quarantine and isolation are identified as prerequisites for opening up in the reviewed studies. This was necessary to identify and contain emerging clusters [26, 27, 61-64].

Kretzschmar et al. [61] have examined different scenarios of isolation and contact tracing settings in combination with social distancing levels for a safe exit strategy. Their modelling study results emphasize tracing non-household contacts during relaxation of restrictions. If not feasible due to public health system constraints, tracing and isolation of only household contacts is also found to significantly reduce the doubling time of the epidemic. A US-based modelling study [62] finds that increasing the capacity for detection, contact tracing and quarantine by at-least two folds would control the cases from rising during medium risk reopening (effective contact rate increased by three-five folds was considered as medium risk opening in the study).
Contact tracing using digital technologies has been suggested in some of the reviewed studies [24, 51, 65]. The acceptability of tracing apps has shown mixed results in this review. A study in Germany [66], found that people preferred to avoid mandatory tracing apps during exit strategy, while a cross-country study [67] from France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the US found strong support for use of apps.

confinement". This study finds "vertical confinement" would only be effective for all those over 50years of age but this would then include the population in the working-age group and thus is not recommended.
A modelling paper [77] based in the UK suggests the strategy of segmenting and shielding the vulnerable. Dividing the population into groups that are relatively homogenous in healthcare needs is defined as segmenting. Those above the age of 70years in receipt of government advice to shield/ in care homes/ receiving care at home are categorized as vulnerable. A study done in Nepal [44] recommends targeted closure and shielding of vulnerable and at-risk populations such as migrants, core case contacts, and family members. The exposure levels of household contacts/ contact with confirmed cases, exposure of border security forces, airport staff, health workers, and front-line workers should all be categorised in terms of high, medium, low, and no identifiable risk. This should be followed by active case management and monitoring based on asymptomatic and symptomatic cases.
The principle supporting the theory of protecting the vulnerable and allowing the healthy ones to carry out regular tasks assumes that it could help a majority of the population to return to normal. Risk classification tools to identify individuals who would require shielding during relaxation of interventions have been suggested in the studies [78, 79].

Ensuring strict physical distancing through lockdowns has helped to control the pandemic; however, this has had a profound ill effect on the economy. Reviewed studies examined various options for lifting physical distancing without increasing COVID-19 cases. We categorize these as below.
Segmenting and shielding at-risk population

Although effective, this strategy may not be acceptable and feasible in all contexts. As observed in study findings from Brazil [76], such a strict age selective containment would not be possible in multi-generational households, especially in LMICs. Similarly, the implications of this strategy need to be interpreted along with considerations for its practical feasibility and potential wider benefits and drawbacks.

Continuing the restrictions and ensuring physical distancing for at-risk population (those above 65years of age, people living in care institutions, and those with chronic conditions) for an extended period compared to other individuals in society has been suggested in reviewed studies. For example, a UK-based modelling [68] study found that if restrictions are continued only for older (60+) and vulnerable people, there will be reduction in hospitalization by 50%, while if restrictions are continued for 50+ population with chronic diseases, the reduction will be by 57%. Few other studies based in the UK [69-71], France [26, 72], China [73], Pakistan [74], and Italy [75] have suggested a similar age-selective restriction strategy for opening up. A study from Brazil [76] refers to age-specific confinement as "vertical

Categorizing high-risk places
From the studies reviewed, mapping of places with high transmission risk, super-spreading events, hotspots, and predicting mobility patterns is suggested before opening [80]. This information would help in designing policies to keep active surveillance of such places or to keep these areas closed while lifting the lockdown.
A review article [81] based on global data has identified indoor settings linked to increased risk of COVID-19 transmission. Large numbers of cases were from hospitals and elderly care settings in Europe. Other clusters with more than 100 cases included large religious gatherings, food processing plants, shopping places, and large

Misra et al. BMC Public Health (2022) 22:488

Page 12 of 16

cohabiting settings (worker dormitories, prisons, and ships). Settings with 50-100 cases included weddings, sports venues, bars, shopping places, and workplaces. Only a small number of clusters were related to schools and cases were most often reported among teachers and staff. An observational study [82] from eight high-income countries concurred with these findings.
Other studies [83-85] based in high-income countries have identified schools as low-risk settings with minimal effect on transmission after their opening compared to other indoor settings.

b) Use of Face Masks
The universal use of face masks after relaxing restrictions has been suggested as an effective exit strategy. Wearing masks by at least 60% of people was found to be a reasonable public health goal and at the same time a plausible strategy. It was found to be much easier than enforcing physical distancing in a modelling study in Australia [91]. This study found using only face masks reduced infections by 54% while using only physical distancing reduced infection by 24.7%. Especially in dense areas, face mask use is effective.

A UK-based modelling study [86] examined the effect of opening schools along with removing restrictions on different occupation groups and concluded increased transmission, i.e., R0 above one (the basic reproduction number, R0 is the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical case of an infection in a population where everyone is susceptible [12]). Continued restriction on recreational activities (e.g., restaurants and bars) during exiting has been suggested in a modelling study based in highincome countries [87].
Daily contact rates
Some modelling studies have suggested a combination of optimal daily contacts to bring R below one. A study based in the UK [88] suggests that while opening up, if the daily contact rate of an individual is maintained at five-six people, R would be reduced below one. For a contact rate of six-seven people, R may increase above one. For eightnine people contact rate, health system capacity would be insufficient and may require another lockdown.
Creating social bubbles
A UK-based modelling study [89] examined the use of social bubbles or contact clustering to reduce contacts while opening from a lockdown. This means that two households would have exclusive contact and form a social bubble. Findings suggest that such a strategy can reduce COVID-related fatality by 42% as opposed to unrestricted socializing. The study shows epidemic risk can be further reduced if the transmission risk within the bubble is minimised.
In the reviewed studies, the importance of continuing some form of physical distancing during exit has been reiterated. E.g., one of the modelling studies [90] concludes sensitivity of the second wave to physical distancing rather than movements in the UK. Thus, indicating a need for physical distancing while opening up.

Another study [92] has shown that face mask use by infectious as well as the susceptible individuals is most effective as it reduces infection chances to 10% compared to 90% if none were wearing a mask. Wang et al. [93] conducted a modelling study using data from China, Italy, UK, and USA concluding the most effective exit strategy would be a combination of physical distancing and face mask use along with intense monitoring of the epidemic.
c) Relaxing travel restrictions
During opening up, a sustainable border control policy should be in sync with internal control measures. A modelling study [94] based on global data suggests opening of borders of countries and states where COVID-19 spread has already been successfully contained by internal measures. Pre-departure screening and testing on arrival are sufficient to keep imported cases in check without any border/travel restrictions [95]. Another modelling study [96] based in the EU correlates a mobility model to passenger air traffic and finds unconstrained mobility would have significantly accelerated the spreading of COVID19. This was especially so in Central Europe, Spain, and France. Network epidemiology can inform political decision making and help countries exit from total lockdown.
Discussion Two years since the first outbreak of COVID-19, and after almost a year and a half of varying restrictive measures, countries had begun to open up from lockdowns in mid-2021. Countries that implemented moderate to severe measures to control the COVID-19 transmission faced challenges. In particular, to devise a safe exit plan, which would limit the transmission and have minimum social and economic costs. Some countries have been reimposing restrictions in light of increasing cases and emergence of newer variants in November-December 2021. Synthesis of the available evidence on exit strategies

can help in policy decision making and analysis of this was found lacking.
This scoping review was undertaken to understand the different strategies that countries adopted to exit from lockdowns to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and to document the effects of these exit strategies.
The majority of the studies adhering to the inclusion criteria were from the high-income countries (68%) and were based on epidemiological modelling exercises (76%), and therefore the results need to be interpreted with caution. We have described the exit strategies around the themes of timing, processes, and supporting conditions for exit answering key questions about when, how, and what.
We find the relaxation of restrictions is most appropriate when there is a decrease in the number of cases after the peak period for at least 2 weeks. This would prevent the health system from being overwhelmed. Determinants such as reduction in the reproduction number, a smaller susceptible population, considerations for the economy, livelihoods, and health system capacity are additional considerations before opening up. This corresponds to the WHO recommendation [97] to undertake a situational assessment of the intensity of transmission and health system capacity, before deciding to lift restrictive measures. WHO's guidance on implementing and adjusting the public health and social measures, emphasizes the importance of flexible decision making for exiting at local levels, in coordination with neighbouring areas at the sub-national as well as the national level [97].
Most of the reviewed studies suggest phase-wise exit to be more effective compared to a hard exit or cyclic lockdowns, considering public health, clinical and social factors. WHO has repeatedly suggested [97, 98] slow, controlled and step-wise relaxation of measures. Moreover, an interval of 2 weeks has been recommended to identify any adverse effects of such measures and adjust the next steps accordingly.
This review suggests the importance of sufficient testing capacity and the need for extensive testing as necessary conditions while exiting. Almost all studies recommend continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions in different combinations when exiting from a lockdown, which need to be in place even after optimal vaccination coverage has been attained. This is also in line with the WHO recommendation [97] for continuously monitoring the transmission levels and adopting appropriate public health measures, even when vaccination has begun. The studies reviewed also suggest the need for the maintenance of strong infection control measures

in health establishments. For international travellers coming from countries with an active outbreak, strict quarantine rules should continue. Strengthening the public health system for detection, tracing, and quarantine should continue till vaccine coverage improves.
Adopting a multi-pronged strategy consisting of these different approaches as per the context is recommended by most studies we reviewed. In the highincome countries, there is a relatively larger proportion of formal sector workers and better health system capacity. Here, we note a reliance on increased testing capacity, and better surveillance to aid the phase-wise opening. In the low-and-middle-income countries, while the principles for opening up remain the same, studies have additionally suggested zonal lockdowns, local and context-specific identification of high-risk places and vulnerable individuals, and more adherence to non-pharmaceutical measures.
This scoping review has a few limitations. First, only two databases were included in the search strategy, likely missing out on other published evidence. However, we expect to have covered the majority of published studies. Second, the review has included studies on the effects of exit strategies on COVID19 related outcomes. Effects on other outcomes such as social and economic aspects were not included. Effects of vaccination coverage on opening up weren't studied as literature on this was in early stages while undertaking the review. Recent literature does point to significant effects of existing COVID vaccines on reducing disease severity (hospitalization and deaths) [99], and on newer variants such as Omicron [100]. Improving vaccination coverage thus becomes an important component of exit strategy. However, due to global vaccine divide, `vaccination' may not be a feasible strategy for many countries at the moment. Further research needs to be undertaken to understand effects of vaccines on exiting from lockdowns in different contexts.
Conclusion Different approaches for exit strategies have been adopted by countries or suggested via modelling exercises in the review findings. These vary from imposing a phase-wise exit to a hard exit. Other strategies which consider vaccination coverage include constant partial lockdowns or a cyclic strategy for lockdown and relaxation till optimum immunity is achieved. Out of these, the phase-wise exit with continuation of non-pharmaceutical interventions appears to be optimal, as per the review findings.

ABSTRACT Background There has been considerable expansion in online postal self-s­ampling (OPSS) STI services in many parts of the UK, driven by increasing demand on sexual health services and developments in diagnostics and digital health provision. This shift in service delivery has occurred against a backdrop of reduced funding and service fragmentation and the impact is unknown. We explored characteristics of people accessing and using OPSS services for STIs in the UK, the acceptability of these services and their impact on sexual health inequalities. Methods A scoping review was conducted of studies published in English-­language based on pre-a­ greed inclusion/exclusion criteria, between 01 January 2010 and 07 July 2021. Nine databases were searched, and 23 studies that met the eligibility criteria were included. Studies were appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results Study designs were heterogeneous, including quantitative, qualitative and mixed-­methods analyses. The majority were either evaluating a single-s­ite/self-­ sampling provider, exploratory or observational and of variable quality. Few studies collected comprehensive user demographic data. Individuals accessing OPSS tended to be asymptomatic, of white ethnicity, women, over 20 years and from less deprived areas. OPSS tended to increase overall STI testing demand and access, although return rates for blood samples were low, as was test positivity. There were varied results on whether services reduced time to treatment. OPSS services were acceptable to the majority of users. Qualitative studies showed the importance of trust, confidentiality, discretion, reliability, convenience and improved patient choice. Conclusion OPSS services appear highly acceptable to users. However, uptake appears to be socially patterned and some groups who bear a disproportionate burden of poor sexual health in the UK are under-r­epresented among users. Current provision of online self-­sampling could widen health inequalities, particularly where other options for testing are limited. Work is needed to fully evaluate the impact and cost-­effectiveness of OPSS services.
INTRODUCTION `Home testing' whereby an individual tests for STIs and/or blood-­borne viruses (BBVs) remote from traditional healthcare settings, encompasses user self-s­ampling (the laboratory processes and tests the samples) or self-t­esting (the user tests their own samples).1 The most widely used option in the UK is online postal self-­sampling (OPSS) in which users order specimen collection kits via the internet. Kits

KEY MESSAGES
 An increasing proportion of STI testing in the UK is occurring via online postal self-­sampling (OPSS) services.
 Service users tend to be asymptomatic, white, women, over 20s and from less deprived areas.
 OPSS services are acceptable to users and can improve choice.
 There is a need for a wide-­ranging evaluation of OPSS services to determine their impact on sexual health inequalities, access, clinical outcomes and service delivery.
are delivered by post or may be collected from a sexual health clinic. Users obtain their own samples (typically urine or vulvo-­vaginal swab, blood, and anorectal and pharyngeal swabs where appropriate), and repackage before posting back to a laboratory for testing. Test results are made available by text message or online. OPSS is increasingly provided in high-­income countries.2-4 England's earliest online chlamydia testing services began in 2006,5 but the other devolved nations of the UK introduced OPSS rather later.6-8 The BASHH recommends online testing and care provision as an adjunct to in-p­ erson services to increase choice for service users.9
The UK had seen a sustained rise in diagnoses of several STIs, and increase in demand for sexual health service (SHS) consultations, until the start of the COVID-­19 pandemic.10 Between 2015 and 2019 in England, there was a 23% increase in the number of SHS consultations (3 143 144-3 852 121). Total sexual health screens for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV increased by 31% (1 657 425 to 2 175 525) in this period. Internet-­ based services have assumed an increasing proportion of consultations and screening activity. In 2018-2019, while overall consultations and tests in England rose by 7% and 10%, respectively, consultations and STI screens provided by internet-­based services surged by 94% and 69%.10 This trend of an increasing proportion of testing and consultations being accessed and provided online has accelerated as a result of the COVID-1­9 pandemic.11 Young people, people from ethnic minority groups, men who have sex with men (MSM), people who are gender diverse, and those living in more deprived areas have borne a disproportionate burden of STIs

and poorer sexual health for many years.12-17 The reasons for this disparity are not sufficiently understood.18
Some evidence suggests that OPSS might improve access to STI services for those who feel uncomfortable or struggle to attend face-­to-­face services,19 and might cost less than in-p­ erson care.20 21 However, relatively little is known about the characteristics of people who use OPSS and the existing literature is heterogeneous and has not previously been comprehensively reviewed. With a drive towards further online sexual health provision in the UK,22 the pre-e­ xisting unequal burden of sexual ill health in the population and well-d­escribed inequalities in access to sexual healthcare, it is important to understand the impact of this shift in service delivery. We aimed to evaluate the current evidence on access to and usage of OPSS services. We have restricted our scope to the UK because online care has been relatively mainstreamed in at least one country (England) for many years and sexual healthcare is provided free at the point of access without the need for specialist referral. Our specific objectives were to: (1) describe characteristics of people accessing and using STI self-s­ampling services in the UK; (2) assess whether OPSS increases demand for testing; (3) assess the impact of OPSS on clinical outcomes; (4) assess levels of acceptability of OPSS services in the UK.
METHODS We conducted a systematic scoping review in order to map and synthesise the current research evidence, in an area where the existing literature is heterogeneous and has not previously been comprehensively reviewed.23 We followed the Joanna Briggs Institute Framework of Evidence Synthesis (https://jbi.global/scoping- review-network/resources) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-­Analyses extension for scoping reviews guidelines.24 A review protocol has not been registered. The Population/Intervention/Comparators/Outcome framework was used to identify the research question and objectives:
Population People residing in the UK who are engaging in sexual activity and accessing online SHS.
Intervention Self-s­ampling STI testing kits which are posted to individuals' homes by online SHS.
Comparators The alternatives to this intervention are for individuals to visit sexual health clinics, general practice, or community outreach services to be tested by healthcare professionals, self-­sample in a clinical setting, or collect kits to bring home. This review will compare OPSS with these comparators where included studies have done so.

Review
self-­sampling kits provided by online SHS (for example, STI education, contraception or self-­testing kits). We also excluded `siloed' (HIV only) HIV self-­sampling services because the national HIV self-­sampling service targets specific key populations such as MSM and black African groups22 rather than the general population, and one of our key objectives was to evaluate access to, including potential inequalities with, the use of OPSS services. Protocols of studies and research displayed via conference or other forms of presentation were excluded if there was no full-­text access.
Study selection De-­duplication and title screening was conducted by the first author; 20% of the abstract screening and 100% of the full-­ text screening were verified by a second reviewer (KCL and JG, respectively) independently to reduce selection bias.25 The inter-­ reliability rate of the two reviewers was over 90% at the abstract screening stage and was 100% for full-t­ext screening.
Search method A systematic search and data extraction was conducted on 22 June 2020 to fulfil requirements of KS' Masters dissertation and was rerun on 7 July 2021 by JG in nine databases: Medline, EMBASE, PsycInfo, the Health Management Information Consortium, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, Scopus, Open Grey and Ethos. The use of two grey literature databases (Open Grey and Ethos) aimed to reduce potential publication bias and provide a more comprehensive view of the evidence.26 The search consisted of a selection of medical subject headings terms, where appropriate, and free-t­ext. Limits were used in applicable databases which limited by date and language. The search comprised of four concepts: types of STI, type of online or self-s­ampling service, accessibility or inequalities, and UK filters. For example, terms such as `STI', `Chlamydia', `Self-­ Sampl*', `eHealth', `Access*', `Inequalit*', `United Kingdom' and `England' were used. To ensure the search strategy was fully comprehensive, additional terms for `eHealth' were included,27 and adapted and simplified versions of two verified filters for the UK were used in database searches, where appropriate.28 29
The search only included studies published between 2010 and 2021; this was due to the very low numbers of users of OPSS services prior to 20105 (see online supplemental file 1 for details of the full search strategy).
Data extraction The phases of data identification, de-­duplication, screening and eligibility checks are shown in figure 1. For included studies, a data extraction form (online supplemental file 2) was used to extract the demographics of the study participants (online supplemental file 3), the study design and key findings from each study (online supplemental file 4).

Outcome Accessibility and usage of OPSS services, with a focus on inequalities in access and acceptability of services, and the impact of these on sexual health inequalities.
Study selection criteria Studies were included if they described the use of home self-­ sampling kits provided by online SHS in the UK, published between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2021 in the English language. All non-­ theoretical study types with full-­text online access were included. Studies were excluded if they described services outside of the UK, published prior to 2010 or not in English, and not focusing on home

Empirical appraisal and analysis of included articles Study designs were heterogeneous, including quantitative, qualitative and mixed-m­ ethods analysis, and were therefore appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT).30 Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.31
RESULTS Overview of included studies This search strategy identified 23 relevant articles that described 10 different OPSS services, all located in England (see table 1 and online supplemental files 3 and 4). The overall quality

Message Service (SMS) containing a link to an OPSS website and the control was a link to a webpage that contained information for clinics where the recruits aged 16-30 years old could access testing . Six studies explored solely chlamydia testing, 1 assessed a chlamydia and gonorrhoea testing service and 17 assessed services which tested for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, HIV and syphilis. Five articles compared demographic characteristics and outcomes of users of OPSS with clinic-b­ ased services.20 32-36
As standardised definitions were not used across the included studies for terms such as `access', `usage' or `demand', we have not attempted to define related terms in this scoping review.
Characteristics of those accessing OPSS services Comprehensive demographic data were not consistently collected across studies, in terms of both type of data collected and what was collected (see table 1). Only two studies collected demographic data on all of gender, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)32 37 ; two collected none of these items.20 38 In addition to age and gender, 6 studies collected IMD data, 17 collected sexual orientation and 21 collected ethnicity, the majority of which were described in different ways using a variety of groupings. Gender types captured also varied between studies, with 2 that did not collect these data, and 10 only reporting binary types.
Those who accessed services tended to be majority women (56.7%-69.4% women, five studies reported statistical significance),5 20 32 34-36 39-41 were residents in less deprived areas compared with accessing testing in other settings (p<0.001),5 32 39 40 white or white British (53.3%-92% users, four studies reported statistical significance),5 32 34-36 39 41 and 20 years old or over (95.4% when compared with any age group,20 32 32.0%-42.9% when c.f. people aged 20-2540 42), with two studies reporting statistical significance.20 32
In those studies that collected more comprehensive gender data, people who identified as gender diverse made up a small proportion of the overall population accessing the service (0.0%-0.4%).35 36 41 43-46
There were limited and conflicting data on access according to sexual orientation; one study reported more MSM requesting access than heterosexual men,32 and one study found that a higher proportion of people identifying as non-h­eterosexual accessed online self-s­ ampling compared with clinic-b­ ased testing (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.72).34 This is in contrast to findings from the Umbrella service, Birmingham.36
Those accessing online services sometimes displayed higher risk behaviours,5 39 but often had a greater proportion of negative test results compared with clinic-b­ ased populations.32 33 35 36 Individuals were more likely to order OPSS kits if they had used STI testing services before.39 Of those who were never-­testers, a significant proportion was recruited face-­to-­face in communities.45
Usage of OPSS services The proportion of users returning self-­sampling test kits varied by study (range 48.3%-78.4%).32 35 36 43 Women were more likely than men to access and return STI self-­sampling kits in the majority of studies.20 32 35 36 39 40 46 One service evaluation found no difference between kit return rates between those identifying as gender diverse and those identifying as cisgender (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.24), although successful return (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.36) and successful testing (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.66) of blood samples were higher in those identifying as trans or non-­binary/gender fluid.43 Characteristics of those who returned test kits varied between studies for age32 36 39 and by level of deprivation.39 46 However,

across several studies, people of white ethnicity were more likely to return the kit compared with other ethnicities.32 35 36
A study that evaluated those accessing an OPSS spontaneously, compared with those who attended clinic and were triaged to testing online, found that the return rate was slightly lower in the triage and signpost group compared with the spontaneous online group (67.0% vs 70.5% by 6 weeks, respectively).20
There are limited data on return rate of blood sampling kits, with one study finding only 54.4% (9033 of 16 611) of people returned a blood sample with a sufficient quantity of blood for testing.36 Studies that examined different types of blood sampling kits found no difference between return rates for dried blood samples (DBS) versus mini-­tests (MTs) (66.5% vs 68.7%),47 but did find that the samples were significantly more likely to be successfully processed with DBS (94.6%-98.8%) compared with MT (55.7%-54.5%, p<0.001).41 47
Impact of OPSS services on demand In many areas, the introduction of OPSS services was not associated with a change in numbers of people attending clinics, but increased the overall demand for STI testing services.20 33 44
Impact on clinical outcomes Test positivity Overall, test positivity for chlamydia and gonorrhoea was lower in OPSS services (4.4%-8.1%) than clinic-b­ ased services (10.3%- 14.4%).32 35 Two studies found a low HIV prevalence in their OPSS testing population; 0.1% (144 of 148 257)48 and 0.8% (75 of 16 611)36 of users in the evaluation period had a reactive HIV result. Of these, 65.3%36 and 91.6%48 had confirmatory testing, and 1.3% (1 of 75)36 and 23.6% (34 of 144) had a new diagnosis of HIV confirmed. When comparing DBS and MT for HIV self-­ sampling, MT was found to have a higher proportion of reactive tests (6.2% vs 0.5%),41 lower proportion of confirmed reactive tests (n=1 of 30 (3.3%) vs 1 of 11 (9.1%))41 and higher false positive tests (5.2%-5.4% vs 0.0%-0.4%).41 47 However, these were service evaluations and the blood sampling kit options were offered sequentially rather than in parallel, so the populations being compared are not directly comparable. In addition, the tests were not compared with the results of a gold standard test (HIV Ab/Ag test), and the authors were unable to provide sensitivity and specificity data.47 These results should therefore be interpreted with caution.
Time to treatment There were varied results regarding time to treatment; one paper reported that online patients took longer to receive treatment than clinic users,35 and one study found that there was no statistically significant difference.44 When an entire care pathway was trialled online and asymptomatic chlamydia-p­ ositive individuals could access an automated online clinical consultation which allowed people to collect their treatment at a community pharmacy, median time to treatment was 1 day (IQR 0-1).49 A study comparing outcomes of asymptomatic service users testing positive for chlamydia via clinic-b­ ased services and online found that those diagnosed online were less likely to wait more than a week for treatment compared with those diagnosed in clinic (OR 9.94, 95% CI 2.87 to 34.42).34
Reporting sexual assault and safeguarding outcomes When evaluating outcomes of those people who reported online a recent sexual assault over a 6-m­ onth period in 2020, one service found that 0.5% (n=242 of 45 841) of users indicated

they had been a victim of a recent sexual assault, which led to telephone intervention by a clinical healthcare professional. Of these, nearly 80% of people were contacted. However, 41.7% (n=101 of 242) of users stated that they had not intended to report recent sexual assault. Fifteen people had already reported the sexual assault and had been seen by the police or by a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC). One person required a SARC referral, and eight people were referred to a clinic-b­ ased service.50 The same service also evaluated their safeguarding outcomes in those aged 16-17 years old, finding that a high proportion of this population (42.5%) met the service criteria for a follow-­up telephone call from a health advisor. The most frequent reason that a call was triggered was related to drug and alcohol use (27%). The outcome of 8.5% of calls was a discussion with the child protection team, with 7.0% requiring a referral or discussion with social services.48 There was no evidence as to whether safeguarding opportunities were missed, or an in-­depth understanding of the acceptability of providing this information in an online setting.
Acceptability of OPSS services Qualitative research showed the importance of trust, confidentiality, discretion, reliability, convenience and improved patient choice in ensuring the successful use of OPSS,51 52 and between 71.1% and 98.0% of individuals surveyed expressed that they were pleased with and found these services acceptable.38 44 45
Economics Although this review did not specifically set out to evaluate the economic outcomes of OPSS services, only one study included any costing data.33 This study, evaluating the impact of online testing across specialist SHS in two London boroughs found that, although there was an increase in the total annual cost of STI testing following the introduction of online testing, the average cost per test and diagnosis decreased.33
DISCUSSION Although evaluations of OPSS of variable quality were found, we did not identify any large-s­cale, multicentre robust studies. Available evidence suggests that OPSS services appear to be more likely to be used by, and acceptable to, asymptomatic individuals who are predominately women, over 20 years of age, residents in less deprived areas and of white ethnicities, when compared with clinic-b­ ased populations. There is preliminary evidence that people from groups experiencing a disproportionate burden of STIs use OPSS less than other groups. The heterogeneity of the included studies prevented full evaluation of clinical outcomes.
Online services tend to be targeted at asymptomatic individuals who do not have other sexual health needs. The ability for asymptomatic people to manage their care needs remotely is an important and useful contribution to detect symptomless STIs, in order to enable treatment of the index patient and partner notification, and reduce morbidity and onward transmission. However, asymptomatic users reported higher risk behaviours in some studies,5 39 and there were no data on the impact of using OPSS on future sexual behaviour. In addition, there was insufficient evidence to be able to establish the impact of OPSS on treatment and partner notification outcomes.
Women were more likely than men to access and return STI self-­ sampling kits in the majority of studies.20 32 35 39 40 46 For services that provided accessibility information by sexual orientation, MSM seemed to be successfully using OPSS services.32 46 This finding is consistent with those from an OPSS in Canada.53 Certain minority

ethnic groups such as black Caribbean, black African and mixed ethnicities, who are also key populations who are at higher risk of poor sexual health, were under-­represented in OPSS users,11 perhaps due to a preference for face-t­o-­face care.52
Some services appear to appropriately reach younger people, but other services were more popular with those aged over 20 years.35 This could be because younger people are more likely to live at home and have concerns about parents finding a test kit delivered through the post.54 Using chlamydia as an exemplar, chlamydia has formed 49% of new STI diagnoses in 2019, yet there has been a 13% reduction in tests completed by young people since 2015.11 Chlamydia is the most commonly reported STI in the UK, and disproportionately affects young people from deprived areas,42 so it is crucial to ensure services are targeting these groups within their region. Despite this, recent research shows that both men (adjusted OR (aOR): 1.36 (95% CI: 1.35 to 1.39), p<0.001) and women (aOR: 1.32 (95% CI: 1.31 to 1.33), p<0.001) living in the least deprived quintile were more likely to use OPSS services for chlamydia screening than those from the most deprived quintile.55
Understanding inequalities in access and usage of OPSS services requires services to collect comprehensive sociodemographic data. Of the 15 included studies, only 2 collected gender, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation and IMD data.32 37 Most studies included categories such as `other' ethnicity or sexual orientation and though a few included trans participants, only one described people of non-­binary, gender fluid or other genders.43 This data gap results in not only a skewed understanding of the impact of STIs on minorities, but also `facilitates the erasure of communities'.18 Further, the inter-r­elations between demographic groups have not been sufficiently examined in these studies despite reference in the literature20 42 56 (eg, 4, 11, 65).
Return rates of blood samples that were sufficient for testing were relatively low, and in keeping with findings from the national HIV self-s­ampling service.57 Overall test positivity was lower in OPSS services compared with clinic-b­ ased services.32 36 This is in keeping with, but more marked than, findings from both selective and unselective national datasets.10 57 As highlighted within one study, the low positive predictive value (PPV) for home-­based BBV testing is concerning36 and requires further evaluation from both a cost-­effectiveness and well-­being perspective.
To our knowledge, this is the first review to explore the accessibility of OPSS services in the UK. The inclusion of qualitative as well as quantitative studies ensured that both acceptability and core themes regarding people's access to and use of services could be explored. The included studies were heterogeneous in design using a variety of methodologies which added value to the review. By excluding hypothetical studies, acceptability and barriers to service use are indicative of the real-l­ife experience of online service users.
Fourteen of 23 studies took place in London and no studies were conducted in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, so findings may not be generalisable to all of the UK. This review did not set out to evaluate partner notification or economic outcomes of OPSS services, but the authors observed that there was a dearth of information on these within the studies that were included in this review. This study only focused on the UK setting as it was focusing on access, and the infrastructure of SHS provision in the UK is different to other settings. However, the findings relating to acceptability and convenience are similar to those reported in systematic review and synthesis of qualitative research on OPSS services.54
OPSS services appear acceptable to current users and improve choice, but evaluation is limited. The existing evidence suggests that successful services achieve reliability, privacy, convenience,

trust and are integrated with clinic-b­ased services to provide ease of transition between modalities of care. Online services are successful in relieving pressure from clinics,58 but clinic-b­ased services remain essential for symptomatic individuals, people who have digital constraints and those who prefer face-t­o-­face care and or require additional safeguarding, among others.18 Further research is required to understand impact on clinical outcomes, including safeguarding opportunities.
With the extensive expansion in provision of OPSS services in recent years, a large-s­cale, multicentre evaluation is needed to determine their cost-­effectiveness and impact on access, clinical outcomes and service delivery. In addition to more targeted evaluations, it would be beneficial to conduct a holistic evaluation across all service modalities (including face-t­o-­face services). Clinical outcomes are key to understanding the cost-­effectiveness of these services and there is limited research into this important factor. Further research is required to understand why people aged under 20 years have lower uptake, and whether this is related to, for example, an individual's experience of autonomy, competence and relatedness59 and how awareness and access can be improved for these individuals.60

ABSTRACT The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) has posed an enormous burden on the global public health system and has had disastrous socioeconomic consequences. Currently, single sampling tests, 20-in-1 pooling tests, nucleic acid point-of-care tests (POCTs), and rapid antigen tests are implemented in different scenarios to detect SARS-CoV-2, but a comprehensive evaluation of them is scarce and remains to be explored. In this study, 3 SARS-CoV-2 inactivated cell culture supernatants were used to evaluate the analytical performance of these strategies. Additionally, 5 recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) proteins were also used for rapid antigen tests. For the wild-type (WT), Delta, and Omicron strains, the lowest inactivated virus concentrations to achieve 100% detection rates of single sampling tests ranged between 1.28 Â 102 to 1.02 Â 103, 1.28 Â 102 to 4.10 Â 103, and 1.28 Â 102 to 2.05 Â 103 copies/mL. The 20in-1 pooling tests ranged between 1.30 Â 102 to 1.04 Â 103, 5.19 Â 102 to 2.07 Â 103, and 2.59 Â 102 to 1.04 Â 103 copies/mL. The nucleic acid POCTs were all 1.42 Â 103 copies/mL. The rapid antigen tests ranged between 2.84 Â 105 to 7.14 Â 106, 8.68 Â 104 to 7.14 Â 106, and 1.12 Â 105 to 3.57 Â 106 copies/mL. For the WT, Delta AY.2, Delta AY.1/ AY.3, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2 recombinant N proteins, the lowest concentrations to achieve 100% detection rates of rapid antigen tests ranged between 3.47 to 142.86, 1.74 to 142.86, 3.47 to 142.86, 3.47 to 142.86, and 5.68-142.86 ng/mL, respectively. This study provided helpful insights into the scientific deployment of tests and recommended the fullscale consideration of the testing purpose, resource availability, cost performance, result rapidity, and accuracy to facilitate a profound pathway toward the long-term surveillance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
IMPORTANCE In the study, we reported an evaluation of 4 detection strategies implemented in different scenarios for SARS-CoV-2 detection: single sampling tests, 20-in-1 pooling tests, nucleic acid point-of-care tests, and rapid antigen tests. 3 SARSCoV-2-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatants and 5 recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins were used for evaluation. In this analysis, we found that for the WT, Delta, and Omicron supernatants, the lowest concentrations to achieve 100% detection rates of single sampling tests ranged between 1.28 Â 102 to 1.02 Â 103, 1.28 Â 102 to 4.10 Â 103, and 1.28 Â 102 to 2.05 Â 103 copies/mL. The 20-in-1 pooling tests ranged between 1.30 Â 102 to 1.04 Â 103, 5.19 Â 102 to 2.07 Â 103, and 2.59 Â 102 to 1.04 Â 103 copies/mL. The nucleic acid POCTs were all 1.42 Â 103 copies/mL. The rapid antigen tests ranged between 2.84 Â 105 to 7.14 Â 106, 8.68 Â 104 to 7.14 Â 106, and 1.12 Â 105 to 3.57 Â 106 copies/mL. For the WT, Delta AY.2, Delta AY.1/AY.3, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2 recombinant N proteins, the lowest concentrations to achieve 100% detection rates of rapid antigen tests ranged between 3.47 to 142.86, 1.74 to 142.86, 3.47 to 142.86, 3.47 to 142.86, and 5.68 to 142.86 ng/mL, respectively.

Evaluation of Four Strategies for SARS-CoV-2 Detection
KEYWORDS 20-in-1 pooling tests, SARS-CoV-2 detection, analytical sensitivity, nucleic acid POCTs, rapid antigen tests, scientific deployment, single sampling tests
Since December of 2019, the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed an enormous burden on the global public health system has had disastrous socioeconomic consequences (1). As of August 26, 2022, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases reported worldwide has exceeded 596 million, and the number of deaths has exceeded 6 million (2). A total of 242,307 confirmed cases and 5,226 deaths have been reported in mainland China (3).
Naturally occurring mutations can be selected continuously during virus transmission, which is a dominating obstacle to the prevention and control of COVID-19. Among the variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI) designated by the World Health Organization (WHO), based on the transmissibility, pathogenicity, and threat to public health (4), the Delta and Omicron variants were first reported in Guangdong on May 18, 2021 (5), and in Tianjin on December 13, 2021 (6), respectively. The P618R mutation of the Delta variant was found to be closely associated with enhanced viral fusogenicity and pathogenicity (7, 8). The Omicron variant harbors a large number of mutations that have been proven to be involved in higher binding affinity with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (9), enhanced pathogenicity and transmissibility (10), and an increased ability of immune evasion (11). In order to confirm infected cases, quarantine populations at risk, and interrupt the chain of transmission, scientific and appropriate detection methods and strategies applicable to specific scenarios should be employed (12).
Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction S(rRT-PCR) is based on the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and is regarded as the most sensitive and specific method for confirming clinical diagnoses (13). Driven by the throughput limitations of single sampling tests and the urgent demand for improving both the daily testing capacity and the overall testing efficiency in low-risk regions, 5-in-1, 10-in-1, and 20-in-1 sample pooling strategies are proposed and executed for large-scale population screening (14). However, due to the fact that rRT-PCR requires sophisticated equipment, professional personnel, and has a long turnaround time (15), the nucleic acid point-of-care test (POCT) was developed to confer the advantages of high sensitivity, short turnaround time, and independence of laboratory settings (16). Considering the necessity of conducting targeted screening in locations with high risks of transmission, the Chinese government advocates employing rapid antigen tests that usually detect viral nucleoproteins as complementary health tools. As of August 29, 2022, 32 rapid antigen tests have been approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for emergency use and are being used in various settings to support rRT-PCR (17).
Regarding the detection methods mentioned above, analytical sensitivity is a fundamental parameter that can facilitate decisions for application and determine their practical use in various scenarios. The performance of the NMPA-approved rRT-PCR assays has been comprehensively analyzed and demonstrated previously; however, there are restricted data on the performance characteristics of these newly approved rapid antigen tests. Additionally, the evaluation of single sampling tests, 20-in-1 pooling tests, nucleic acid POCTs, and rapid antigen tests implemented in different scenarios is scarce and remains to be explored. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the analytical sensitivities of these four detection strategies applied in different settings and to provide sufficient researchbased evidence for the scientific refinement of the deployment of these tests.
RESULTS Nucleic acid amplification tests. In this study, 50 mL of inactivated cell culture super-
natants were added to different volumes of sample preservation solution or extraction solution, and the final concentration obtained was used for analysis. For single sampling tests and 5 rRT-PCR detection kits, the lowest inactivated virus concentrations to achieve 100%

detection ranged between 1.28 Â 102 to 1.02 Â 103, 1.28 Â 102 to 4.10 Â 103, and 1.28 Â 102 to 2.05 Â 103 copies/mL for the wild-type (WT), Delta, and Omicron strains, respectively, corresponding to 7.81 Â 103 to 6.25 Â 104, 7.81 Â 103 to 2.50 Â 105, and 7.81 Â 103 to 1.25 Â 105 copies/mL of the 50 mL original sample. For the 20-in-1 pooling tests and 5 rRT-PCR detection kits, the lowest concentrations ranged between 1.30 Â 102 to 1.04 Â 103, 5.19 Â 102 to 2.07 Â 103, and 2.59 Â 102 to 1.04 Â 103 copies/mL for the WT, Delta, and Omicron strains, respectively. Kit N03 reliably detected as few as 102 copies/mL for both sampling strategies, showing the most sensitive performance compared with the other rRT-PCR kits. Unexpectedly, the POCT Kit P01 showed a comparable analytical sensitivity to those of the rRT-PCR kits with the lowest concentration of 1.42 Â 103 copies/mL for all three strains (Table 1; Supplemental Material File 3).
Overall, when detecting the diluted samples higher than the claimed limits of detection (LODs), the 20-in-1 pooling tests could substantially achieve the same detection performance as could the single sampling tests. When it came to the Delta (22/27 versus 15/27, P = 0.040) and Omicron (22/27 versus 14/27, P = 0.021) variants below than the claimed LODs, impaired analytical sensitivity was found in the 20-in-1 pooling strategy using Kit N03. In terms of test results among variants, in contrast to the WT strain, the Delta variant adversely affected the analytical sensitivity of Kit N04, both for the single sampling tests (19/27 versus 11/27, P = 0.028) and for the 20-in-1 pooling tests (16/27 versus 7/27, P = 0.013).

5.00 Â 107, 7.81 Â 105 to 5.00 Â 107, and 7.81 Â 105 to 2.50 Â 107 copies/mL of the 50 mL original sample (Table 2; Supplemental Material File 3). We also tested 19 rapid antigen tests with 5 recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N proteins. The lowest concentrations ranged from 3.47 to 142.86 ng/mL, 1.74 to 142.86 ng/mL, 3.47 to 142.86 ng/mL, 3.47 to 142.86 ng/mL, and 5.68 to 142.86 ng/mL for the WT, Delta AY.2, Delta AY.1/AY.3, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2 recombinant N proteins, respectively (Table 3; Supplemental Material File 3). Almost all of the rapid antigen tests reliably detected around 2.50 Â 107 copies/mL of 50 mL of inactivated supernatants and 500 ng/mL of 50 mL of recombinant N proteins.
In contrast to the rRT-PCR kits, great variations in analytical sensitivity were observed among the rapid antigen kits. The lowest concentrations that achieved a 100% rate of detection success ranged from 104 to 106 copies/mL for inactivated cell culture supernatants and from 1 to 150 ng/mL for recombinant N proteins. The best analytical performance was achieved by Kit A05 in detecting inactivated viruses. For detecting recombinant N proteins, Kit A01 performed the best. The assay manufactured by Kit A19 was considerably less sensitive than the other assays in detecting both inactivated viruses and recombinant N proteins. However, for each rapid antigen test, no significant differences in analytical sensitivity were found among the 3 inactivated cell culture supernatants or the 5 recombinant N proteins.
DISCUSSION In China, since May of 2021, the Delta variant with an R0 value below 7 (original strain
2.5) has ravaged many cities, including Guangzhou, Nanjing, Yangzhou, Putian, Xiamen, and Ejina Banner. The Omicron variant is estimated to have an R0 value of up to 10 and a doubling time of every 2 to 3 days (18), which makes it reasonable to supersede Delta as the dominant variant by December of 2021. With the proportion of asymptomatic infections calculated to be as high as 80 to 90%, as well as the rapid occult transmissibility (19), the Omicron variant has swept numerous cities with an unprecedented speed, especially in Shanghai, where the number of daily confirmed infected cases has roared up to 20,000 for days on end. Faced with the grim situation of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the Omicron variant, which has a higher pathogenicity and spreads more rapidly, frequent testing enables the early detection of infections, which is critical in providing a prompt diagnosis for patient management and in conducting epidemiological studies to promote public health measures (20-22). Several studies (23, 24) have revealed that nearly one-fifth of all virus transmission was recognized to be associated with asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals, and the efficacy of outbreak control depends mostly on the frequency of testing, rather than on test sensitivity, through epidemiological modeling. Therefore, pandemic prevention and control strategies are required to cut off the transmission chains within communities through the scale-up of diagnostic testing, contact tracing, and quarantining (25).
The continuous COVID-19 pandemic has promoted the occurrence and development of a variety of diagnostic strategies based on different principles. Due to the urgent demand during the unremitting transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the performance characteristic of analytical sensitivity has not been thoroughly demonstrated for the different detection methods. In this study, a 50 mL uniform volume of WT, Delta, and Omicron cell culture supernatants with given concentrations were used to obtain approximate ranges of the analytical sensitivities of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs; single sampling tests, 20-in-1 pooling tests, and nucleic acid POCT) and rapid antigen tests applied in different scenarios.
At the beginning of the outbreak, the single sampling test of rRT-PCR was regarded as the most sensitive and specific method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, and it was recommended for confirming infected cases and testing specific groups, including the contacts of confirmed or frequently exposed groups (26), to ensure the timely implementation of public health measures and patient management procedures, such as contact tracing and quarantine. In the study, for the single sampling tests, the lowest inactivated virus concentrations at 100% detection rates for the five detection kits most commonly used in China were found to have a range of around 1 Â 102 and 5 Â 103 copies/mL, with Kit N03 performing the best. Large-scale population screening via the rRT-PCR method plays a crucial

Evaluation of Four Strategies for SARS-CoV-2 Detection
role in the identification of COVID-19 positive cases. In the quest for improving overall detection efficiency with an acceptable slight loss of analytical sensitivity, the pooling strategies are proposed, and these can be implemented to expedite the early discovery of community transmission, promote timely infection control measures of SARS-CoV-2, and alleviate the workload of medical staff. By mixing nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and testing them as a single pool, the detection kits and turnaround times are largely economized. Catherine et al. (27) showed that a 9/10-in-1 pooling strategy could detect positive samples correctly at a population prevalence rate of 0.07%. Idan et al. (28) found that the false-negative rate of a 32-in-1 pooling strategy can be as low as 10%. Stefan et al. (14) proposed a 30-in-1 pooling strategy for increasing test efficiency on the premise of ensuring the correct detection of positive samples. However, the primary bottleneck of pooled testing is the reduced concentration of viral genetic material below the limit of detection for certain tests due to sample dilution, which thereby leads to decreased diagnostic sensitivity and false-negative results (29). When using the 5 rRT-PCR kits to detect the same strain, the range of the lowest inactivated virus concentration to achieve 100% detection via 20-in-1 pooling tests was substantially the same as that of the single sampling tests. Overall, when detecting the diluted samples above the claimed LODs, the 20-in-1 pooling tests showed comparable analytical sensitivities to those of the single sampling tests. Studies (30) have found that the viral load at the early onset was beyond 1Â106 copies/mL, which can be detected by both single sampling tests and 20-in-1 pooling tests. Therefore, the 20-in-1 pooling tests enable mass nucleic acid testing with only 5% of the original testing workload, greatly improving the daily testing efficiency, which is the first consideration in the screening of asymptomatic infected cases in low-risk regions (31). Nevertheless, regarding the possibility of the increasing need to retest singly, the optimal pool size, while ensuring the expected analytical sensitivity and time efficiency, requires the deliberation of the prevalence rates in the community, the infection situations, the aim of the testing, and the available resources. In addition, due to the Omicron variant's capability of aerosol transmission (32), prevention measures, including mask use, well-zoned sampling sites, and sufficiently dispersed staff density should be strictly implemented during the organization of sample collection.
The nucleic acid point-of-care test has the advantage of not relying on laboratory equipment and professional personnel to detect viral nucleic acid, but its extensive deployment in domestic regions is impeded by the development and manufacturing of technology platforms. Furthermore, the sensitivity level of self-administered nucleic acid POCT for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA also varies, depending on the methods and application settings. Unexpectedly, the Ustar nucleic acid POCT, which combines cross-priming amplification (CPA) and nucleic acid lateral flow technologies, can detect samples at concentrations as low as 1.42 Â 103 copies/mL, showing excellent performance in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the study. With a short turnaround time, portable procedures (33), and an analytical sensitivity comparable to that of the gold standard rRT-PCR, nucleic acid POCT is a promising diagnostic agent for aiding in the expansion of testing (34) and can be used as confirmatory testing where laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification testing is not available (35). However, due to the scarcity of portable nucleic acid POCT assays validated in China, only one CE-IVD marked kit was included in the study. More evidence-based experimental data remains to be explored in order to obtain a comprehensive view of the performance of this method in detecting SARS-CoV-2.
Rapid antigen tests are developing rapidly and are becoming available from various manufacturers in response to the Omicron variant wreaking havoc in many regions of China. With the advantages of being free of laboratory settings, offering a shorter time to result, and being mass and cost-effective to manufacture, they can act as a potential alternative method if molecular tests are not available (36). Our study revealed that the detection performance of different rapid antigen kits varied greatly, and the lowest concentrations that achieved a 100% rate of detection success ranged from 104 to 106 copies/mL for inactivated cell culture supernatants and from 1 to 150 ng/mL for recombinant N proteins, which was essentially consistent with the findings reported in

previously published articles (35, 37). The antibody labeling method of rapid antigen tests would affect their analytical performance, and the fluorescence microsphere was observed to enhance the sensitivity of the analytical signal by 10 to 100-fold compared to that of the latex microsphere and colloidal gold (38). Besides, the lowest concentrations of the 50 mL original sample that displayed 100% detection by rapid antigen tests (105 to 107 copies/mL) were about 100 times as high as those of the single sampling test (103 to 105 copies/mL). On account of the viral load changing rapidly during the acute phase of infection, rapid antigen tests can only be applied validly in the first week of symptoms (39). Studies (40-42) have also found that there is little chance of transmitting the virus for patients with a viral load of less than 1 Â 106 copies/mL at the end of the first week of symptoms, meaning that rapid antigen tests can be used as tools by which to estimate infectivity and that a negative antigen result is an indication of infectivity resolution. On the whole, although they are not as sensitive and specific as molecular tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, rapid antigen tests should be considered as rapid diagnostic tools that require minimal training and offer cost-effective and time-saving detection processes for the instantaneous assessment of infectivity rather than for the exclusion of infection, mass screening in high-risk areas, and the detection of symptomatic cases meeting the COVID-19 case definition (43). However, a randomized clinical trial (44) found that a large proportion of the population misinterpreted the negative results of at-home self-tests or ignored the CDC's recommendations to self-isolate, creating redundant disruptions and unexpected risks. Consequently, user compliance and the interpretability of the results should be improved to maximize the benefits of at-home self-test kits.
The indispensable factors for a correct diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 include the attributes of the detection method itself, the sampling time after the onset of symptoms, the quality of the specimen, the proficiency of the test, and the interpretation of the result. Also, the continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 affects the accuracy and reliability of detection results to a certain extent. Once the mutations of the virus are located at the primer/probe-targeted regions, the effectiveness of molecular assays might be influenced to some degree. In this study, in contrast to the WT strain, impaired analytical sensitivity was found in the Delta variant using Kit N04, both for the single sampling tests (19/27 versus 11/27, P = 0.028) and for the 20-in-1 pooling tests (16/27 versus 7/ 27, P = 0.013), whereas the Omicron variant had no significant effect on the 5 rRT-PCR kits and the POCT kit, which is in concordance with the findings of a prior study (45). However, the 19 rapid antigen tests showed an insignificant difference in analytical sensitivity for the 3 inactivated cell culture supernatants and the 5 recombinant N proteins, which might be attributable to the fact that nearly all of the rapid antigen tests target the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, which has less of a probability to mutate (12). Hence, to ensure the validity of the different detection strategies under the background of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, it is essential to consolidate genomic surveillance and track the potential effects of mutations on detection performance.
In conclusion, the study evaluated the analytical sensitivity of 4 SARS-CoV-2 detection strategies applied in different settings and provided helpful insights into the scientific deployment of these tests (Table 4). Generally, the analytical sensitivities of nucleic acid amplification tests were superior to those of rapid antigen tests, with the single sampling strategy showing the highest. In a specific scenario, the optimal strategy should be adopted in consideration of the testing purpose, resource availability, cost performance, and result rapidity on the premise of test accuracy to thereby improve the overall detection efficiency, facilitate the discovery of early community transmission, and enable timely and long-term infection control measures under the conditions of limited detection capacity and overburdened laboratory infrastructure.

supernatants with determined viral loads. As a complement, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N proteins were also used for the rapid antigen tests (Fig. 1).
3 inactivated cell culture supernatants of SARS-CoV-2 WT, Delta, and Omicron strains were provided by the Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd. (China). For quantification, viral RNAs with proper dilutions were extracted using a QIAamp Viral RNA Minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and were reverse transcribed into cDNAs using a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Perfect Real Time; TaKaRa, Japan). Subsequently, the samples were subjected to droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) on a Bio-Rad QX-200 System (USA), using the N gene assay recommended by China's Centers for Disease Control (CDC). 5 recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 WT strain (cat. number 40588-V07E), Delta AY.2 sublineage (cat. number 40588V07E29), Delta AY.1/AY.3 sublineage (cat number 40588-V07E32), Omicron BA.1 sublineage (cat number 40588-V07E34), and Omicron BA.2 sublineage (cat number 40588-V07E35) were obtained from Sino Biological, Inc. (China). The concentrations of the recombinant N proteins were measured using a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer with the Qubit Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).

To evaluate the analytical sensitivity in real-world sampling situations, a total of 1 and 20 oropharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2-negative healthy volunteers were placed into a single sampling tube containing 3 mL of a sample preservation solution and a 50 mL centrifuge tube containing 12 mL of a sample preservation solution, respectively. Each sample was prepared 27 times. After full oscillation and blending, serial 2-fold dilutions of the WT, Delta, and Omicron cell culture supernatants were performed (5 Â 105, 2.5 Â 105, 1.25 Â 105, 6.25 Â 104, 3.12 Â 104, 1.56 Â 104, 7.81 Â 103, 3.91 Â 103, and 1.95 Â 103 copies/mL), and 50 mL of them were added to each sample, respectively. Remarkably, this step with positive supernatants diluted in sample preservation solution introduces a predilution effect (1:61 as 50 mL in 3,050 mL for the single sampling test and 1:241 as 50 mL in 12,050 mL for the 20-in-1 pooling test), leading to a loss of sensitivity as claimed by the reagent manufacturers. This factor was staken into account when calculating the analytical sensitivity afterwards. Nucleic acid was extracted using a Tianlong automatic nucleic acid extraction system (NP968-C, Xi'an Tianlong Science and Technology Co., Ltd.), and tested in triplicate using 5 NMPA approved SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR kits (Kit N01, Daan Gene Co., Ltd. of Sun Yat-sen University; Kit N02, Shanghai BioGerm Medical Technology Co., Ltd.; Kit N03, Sansure Bio-tech Co., Ltd.; Kit N04, Shanghai Liferiver BioTech Co., Ltd.; and Kit N05, Wuhan EasyDiagnosis Biomedicine Co., Ltd.) (Table 5). The retesting and interpretation of results were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions (Supplemental Material File 1; Table S1).

Evaluation of Four Strategies for SARS-CoV-2 Detection
Nucleic acid POCTs are portable, easy-to-operate, and isothermal amplification-based devices that are mainly characterized by their relative sensitivity, simple operation, short turnaround time, and independence of laboratory settings (33). The EasyNAT COVID-19 RNA Test from Ustar Biotechnologies Ltd. carries out CPA reactions through specific primers, probes, and DNA polymerase with high strand displacement activity to qualitatively detect the ORF1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2 with a claimed LOD of 3 Â 103 copies/mL (46). Self-collected nasopharyngeal swabs are immersed in the lysis buffer, one drop of which is added to a module preloaded with nucleic acid amplification reagents. After 55 min of reaction, the results can be available in the corresponding lateral flow strips. To identify the analytical sensitivity of the handheld portable POCT product (coded as Kit P01), 50 mL of the above supernatants were introduced into the lysis buffer provided with the kit in triplicate, which resulted in a predilution effect of 1:11. The subsequent procedures and interpretation of results were carried out as per the instructions.
Rapid antigen tests. The main principle behind rapid antigen testing is the use of lateral flow immunoassays designed with the fluorescence microsphere, latex microsphere, or colloidal gold labeled SARSCoV-2 protein antibody to form an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex. Within 15 min, the test results can be interpreted with simple instruments when using the fluorescence method or with the naked eye when using the latex and colloidal gold methods. We included 19 rapid antigen tests approved by the NMPA in our study, including two fluorescence immunochromatography methods (Kit A01, BGI Biotech Co., Ltd. and Kit A02, Beijing Savant Biotechnology Co., Ltd.), five latex methods (Kit A03, Beijing Jinwofu Bioengineering Technology Co., Ltd.; Kit A04, Hangzhou ACON Biotech Co., Ltd.; Kit A05, Hangzhou AllTest Biotech Co. Ltd.; Kit A06, Tangshan Innovita Biological Technology Co., Ltd.; and Kit A07, Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics, Inc.), and 12 colloidal gold methods (Kit A08, Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech Co. Ltd.; Kit A09, Nanjing Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd.; Kit A10, Beijing Hotgen Biotech Co., Ltd.; Kit A11, Beijing Lepu Medical Technology Co., Ltd.; Kit A12, Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd.; Kit A13, Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co., Ltd.; Kit A14, Wuhan EasyDiagnosis Biomedicine Co., Ltd.; Kit A15, Zybio, Inc.; Kit A16, Xiamen AmonMed Biotechnology Co., Ltd.; Kit A17, Shandong Kanghua Biotech Co., Ltd.; Kit A18, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co. Ltd.; and Kit A19, Beijing Applied Biological Technologies Co. Ltd.) (Table 1). 50 mL of the WT, Delta, and Omicron supernatants at 1 Â 108, 5 Â 107, 2.5 Â 107, 1.25 Â 107, 6.25 Â 106, 3.12 Â 106, 1.56 Â 106, 7.81 Â 105, and 3.91 Â 105 copies/mL were added to the sample extraction solution provided with each kit in triplicate, respectively. Also, 50 mL of the WT, Delta AY.2, Delta AY.1/AY.3, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2 recombinant N proteins at 1,000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.62, and 7.81 ng/mL were subjected to the same detection processes. The recommended volume of sample extraction solution varied from 280 mL to 600 mL for the different kits, resulting in different predilution ratios, which ranged from 1:6.6 to 1:13. The results were independently assessed by two laboratory technicians. In cases of inconsistent events, a third technician was consulted to draw a conclusion.
Statistical analysis. The concentration equivalent of the 50 mL sample was the lowest concentration that achieved a 100% detection rate of the 50 mL original sample before being added to the sample preservation solution. The lowest concentration with a 100% detection rate was that of the diluted sample. The predilution ratios varied according to the volumes of sample preservation solution (3 mL for the single sampling tests and 12 mL for the 20-in-1 pooling tests) or extraction solution (point-of-care test and rapid antigen tests), to which 50 mL samples of known concentrations were added (Table 2; Supplemental Material File 2).
The variance between the different tests was compared using Pearson's chi-square test in the SPSS Statistics for Windows (version 19.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) software package. A P value of less than 0.05 was regarded as indicative of a statistically significant result.

Abstract Background: Previous studies have reported Blood type O to confer a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while secretor status and other blood groups have been suspected to have a similar effect as well. Study design and methods: To determine whether any other blood groups influence testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 severity, or prolonged COVID-19, we used a large cohort of 650,156 Danish blood donors with varying available data for secretor status and blood groups ABO, Rh, Colton, Duffy, Diego, Dombrock, Kell, Kidd, Knops, Lewis, Lutheran, MNS, P1PK, Vel, and Yt. Of these, 36,068 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 whereas 614,088 tested negative between 2020-02-17 and 2021-08-04. Associations between infection and blood groups were assessed using logistic regression models with sex and age as covariates. Results: The Lewis blood group antigen Lea displayed strongly reduced SARSCoV-2 susceptibility OR 0.85 CI[0.79-0.93] p < .001. Compared to blood type O, the blood types B, A, and AB were found more susceptible toward infection with ORs 1.1 CI[1.06-1.14] p < .001, 1.17 CI[1.14-1.2] p < .001, and 1.2 CI[1.14-1.26] p < .001, respectively. No susceptibility associations were found for the other 13 blood groups investigated. There was no association

between any blood groups and COVID-19 hospitalization or long COVID-19. No secretor status associations were found. Discussion: This study uncovers a new association to reduced SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility for Lewis type Lea and confirms the previous link to blood group O. The new association to Lea could be explained by a link between mucosal microbiome and SARS-CoV-2.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a link was reported between ABO blood type and infection susceptibility.1 Evidence for this link has been mounting as size and quality of data have grown,2-5 although a clear explanation for the mechanism behind this link has yet to be definitively established. One of the several explanations that has been put forward is a potential interaction between anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies and SARSCoV-2 viral products.6,7 This would explain why most studies conclude that ABO type O, with presence of both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the blood, confers the lowest infection susceptibility.
Recent interest in SARS-CoV-2 and blood groups associations has moved beyond susceptibility, to focus on disease severity and symptom duration. While the ABO blood group continues to be the main focus of such investigations, some studies have ventured beyond and also looked at secretor status8-10 and some of the many other recognized blood group systems, such as Rh5,11-15 and Lewis.10
However, limitations of these previous studies include, for example, matching patient cases with blood donor controls4,10 and small cohort sizes.13,14,16,17 In addition, so far, few studies have looked at the effects of the many existing blood groups beyond ABO and Rh.
With access to data on sex, age, and SARS-CoV-2 tests results for 650,156 blood donors: Data on COVID-19 related hospitalization: Nearly complete blood type data available for ABO and RhD: Partial availability of blood type data for selected antigens from 13 other blood group systems, and secretor status; The present study aimed to address some of these shortcomings and investigated the influence of blood groups on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, COVID-19 hospitalization, and long COVID-19.

2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
The nationwide and complete SCANDAT18 cohort of Danish blood donors included 650,156 donors with at least one SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antigen test registered in the Danish Microbiology Database (MiBa).19 Sex, age, serological ABO, and RhD blood type data were available for almost all donors in the cohort. Data in other blood groups were only available for varying proportions of the donors (Table S1).
We identified 36,068 SARS-CoV-2 cases, defined as a blood donor with any positive RT-PCR or antigen test and 614,088 controls, defined as any blood donor with only negative test result entries in the MiBa dataset, covering the period between 2020-02-17 and 2021-08-04.
RT-PCR and antigen quick tests were a cornerstone in the Danish strategy to keep COVID-19 in check. Testing is free of charge and for the unvaccinated, a negative test result grants a temporary COVID-19 passport, which in periods has been necessary for certain social activities, like restaurant visits, attending events, etc. If an antigen quick test is positive, a PCR test is encouraged to confirm COVID-19, and upon confirmation, self-isolation is recommended. During 2020-2021, where the Danish vaccination program was slowly being rolled out, the Danish population was subject to frequent antigen and RT-PCR testing.
2.1 | Definitions of severe and long COVID-19
The MiBa dataset also included information on infectionrelated hospitalizations, defined as either not hospitalized, hospitalized for short duration of less than two

weeks, hospitalized for more than two weeks, or hospitalized at intensive care unit (ICU) requiring respiratory support. Based on these additional registrations, 1317 severe COVID-19 cases were identified, defined as any who were treated at a hospital for their infection, and 32,209 severe COVID-19 controls, who were infected, but not treated at a hospital.
A total of 135,326 of the Danish blood donors had previously consented to participate in the Danish Blood Donor Study (DBDS).20 A subgroup of 80,000 active DBDS donors was invited to fill out an online questionnaire on COVID-19 between 2020-10-30 and 2021-01-19. A total of 32,837 donors (41%) responded to the questionnaires. The questionnaire included items on specific COVID-19-related symptoms both at time of infection and, if persistent, at the time of filling out the questionnaire. These included, fever, chills, runny or stuffy nose, decreased sense of smell or taste, sneezing, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, headache, muscle and joint pain, chest pain, tiredness and exhaustion, memory problems / difficulty concentrating, lack of appetite, colored sputum / mucus, reddened watery eyes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain. Based on the questionnaires, we identified 1578 COVID-19 cases. Of these, 441 were long COVID-19 cases, defined as any respondent with a positive RT-PCR test who reported having any of the aforementioned COVID-19-related symptoms more than three months after a positive RTPCR result.
2.2 | Blood group data
Blood group data were mainly sourced from a large dataset of serological blood type tests retrieved from electronic blood bank systems. In addition, some blood type data was generated using genetic data obtained using Infinium Global Screening Array from Illumina, with subsequent imputation at deCODE genetics, Reykjavik,

Iceland, using North European reference sequence panel. Genetic data were available for $100,000 DBDS participants.
All sourced blood type data, except for ABO, were stored in binary variables, as either positive (1) or negative (0), for a given RBC antigen. This binary encoding was used in the logistic regression models.
The ABO system blood types are categorized as A, B, AB, or O. ABO logistic regression models were performed using two alternate encodings of this data. First, we compared type O versus either A, B, or AB. However, since the prevailing theory on the mechanism of ABO and COVID-19 susceptibility implicates ABO antibodies interacting with the virus, an alternate encoding was used based on presence of the ABO antibodies like anti-A, anti-B, or anti-A + anti-B in the blood. These were encoded as binary variables indicating present (1) or absent (0).
Similar to most other antigen data, the Lewis blood group system was determined serologically for the Lea and Leb antigens separately and combined into the Lewis phenotypes Le(a+b-), Le(a-b+), and Le(a-b-). The Lewis blood group logistic models were first based on being either positive (1) or negative (0) for a given Lewis phenotype. This encoding was chosen due to a previous study10 finding an association between having Lewis phenotype Le(a-b-) and lower COVID-19 severity. However, separate Lea and Leb RBC antigen models were also analyzed because there were more serological test results available for Lea than Leb (102,000 vs 67,000) to increase the statistical power.
Secretor status has known associations with susceptibility to infectious agents, including certain viruses.21,22 Given prior viral associations, secretor status has been suspected to influence ABO COVID-19 susceptibility in other studies.8,9 To verify these findings, logistic models were made accounting for a potential interaction between secretor status and the effect of ABO types on COVID-19 susceptibility.

All secretor status data in our study was genetically derived using variant rs601338,23 while all Lewis, ABO, and RhD data were based on serological tests. The remaining blood groups were a mix of both genetic and serological sources (Table S2).
3 | STATISTICS
All data analysis was performed using the glm function in R v4.0.0. Logistic regression models were used in all statistical analyses reporting odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). All logistic regression model results are reported with having a positive phenotype as the dependent/outcome variable. All logistic regression models are adjusted for sex and age.
p-values for models in blood groups with prior published COVID-19 associations (ABO, secretor, Lewis, RhD) were not adjusted for multiple testing, as the tests were assessed as confirming prior findings. For the remaining analyses, the false discovery rate was set using the Benjamini & Hochberg procedure (fdr).13
4 | RESULTS
The demographic data are presented in Table 1. SARSCoV-2 cases were on average five years younger than the controls and the hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 cases were on average eight years older than those that were not hospitalized. The OR of infection susceptibility with increasing age was 0.98 CI[0.977-0.978] p < 2 eÀ16, for each year increase in age. Infection severity and long COVID-19 were both strongly associated with each year of increasing age, with ORs of 1.07 CI[1.06.-1.07] p = 1.37 eÀ240 and 1.02 CI[1.01-1.03] p = 9.91 eÀ06, respectively. There was a strong association with sex, with males having a higher susceptibility OR of 1.04 CI[1.02-1.07] p = 9.36 eÀ05, a higher severity OR of 1.36 CI[1.2-1.52] p = 1.84 eÀ07, and a lower long COVID-19 OR of 0.67 CI[0.53- 0.84] p = 6.53 eÀ04. (Table 2).

A difference in ABO blood type ratios was seen between SARS-CoV-2 cases and controls with the latter having approximately 4% higher occurrence of blood type O, and lower occurrence of the other ABO blood types (Table 1). Individuals with blood types B, A, and AB were found more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 with ORs of 1.10 CI[1.06-1.14] p = 5.42 eÀ07, 1.17 CI[1.14-1.20] p = 1.29 eÀ36, and 1.20 CI[1.14-1.26] p = 7.85 eÀ12, respectively, when compared to blood type O. ABO antibody-specific models revealed strong SARS-CoV-2 protective effects for presence of both anti-A + anti-B in blood, only anti-A in blood or only anti-B in blood, with ORs 0.86 CI[0.84-0.88] p = 5.85 eÀ37, 0.87 CI[0.85-0.89] 1.52 eÀ34, and 0.95 CI[0.93-0.99] p = 6.61 eÀ03, respectively (Table 3). We performed a sensitivity analysis revealing that the significance of the finding could be eliminated (p > .05) by reducing the ABO cohort size down below 1.2% ($7000 donors); however, the ORs remain higher for A, B, and AB compared to O.
We found no evidence for an interaction between genetically determined secretor status and higher infection susceptibility of ABO blood types A, B, or AB, p > .05 (Table 3).
An association was found between SARS-CoV-2 positives and the non-secretor Lewis phenotype Le(a+bÀ) with OR 0.88 CI[0.78-0.99] p = 0.029, whereas phenotypes Le(a-b+) and Le(a-bÀ) were not associated, p > .05. The Lewis Lea antigen-specific model resulted in a stronger association with OR 0.85 CI[0.79-0.93] p = 4.85 eÀ04, while the Leb RBC antigen model was insignificant p > .05 (Table 4). No infection severity associations were found for Lewis phenotypes Le(a+b-), Le(a-b+), and Le (a-bÀ), and results did not change when using the Lewis RBC antigen-specific models, p > .05. Furthermore, no association between Lewis types Le(a+bÀ) and Le(a-b+) and long COVID-19 were found. There was insufficient data for a Le(a-bÀ) model. The Lewis antigen-specific models did not shift the results (Table 4).
Secretor status by itself was neither associated with infection susceptibility, disease severity, nor long COVID-19, p > .05 (Table 5).

After adjusting for multiple testing, no blood group antigens or phenotypes beyond ABO and Lewis gave any significant associations to any of the outcomes tested (Tables S3 and S4).
5 | DISCUSSION
This large nationwide Danish study on SARS-CoV-2 and blood groups confirmed previous reports of type O being least susceptible to infection. This study further reports a new association suggesting that those who have the Lea blood group antigen are also less susceptible to infection. Since the presence of Lea antigen signals a non-secretor phenotype, this association is well compatible with previous reports suggesting increased disease severity for secretors8 on one hand and decreased susceptibility to disease for non-secretors, at least for blood group A.9
In accordance with previous large studies, we found support for type AB having the highest OR for infection susceptibility.2,5 However, AB is the rarest ABO type with a 5% prevalence in the Danish population. This is reflected in a wider confidence interval for AB compared to the more common type A, which has a high prevalence of 42% in the Danish population.
There have been conflicting reports regarding ABO blood type and SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. One study has pointed to AB being least susceptible,24 while most studies seem to agree that type O is least susceptible to infection.2,3,5-9,11,13,15 Conflicting results may well reflect the small sample sizes for the majority of published studies or because of the setting of the studies. Some studies have much higher exposure risk and inoculum sizes than others.25,26 Thus, as previous studies have speculated, the protective effect of ABO-antibodies on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility could be eliminated with increasing exposure.27
Another source of conflicting results could be due to cohort mixing, such as case-control studies where cases are COVID-19 patients from the general population, while the controls are blood donors.10,4 Blood bank cohorts are known to have different blood type ratios when compared to the general population. This is a known phenomenon due to blood banks having biases toward certain blood types, deemed more useful for transfusions, giving rise to a slight overrepresentation of blood donors with the desired blood types.28
In regards to the mechanism behind the association, the theory of ABO antigens facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry is contented.29 When considering the alternate theory of ABO antibodies interacting with the SARS-CoV-2 virus,7,26 the results of the ABO antibody centric models make more sense. The hypothesis is that anti-A has a stronger protective effect, providing subsequent lower

susceptibility, when compared to anti-B. Supporting this notion, having both anti-A and anti-B showed the lowest susceptibility in our data, benefiting from a hypothesized two-way antibody attack on the virus. A third theory currently under investigation relates to iron levels, which have been linked to ABO blood type,30 and play an important role in the immune system.31
A potential confounder is admixture of blood donors of other ethnicities than Danish (approximately 4% of the donors) who might have different blood type ratios than the Danish population. In addition, a higher infection rate has been reported among these, which we confirmed by observing a 1.8% higher incidence of infection among donors with a birth country other than Denmark in our cohort. The majority of our foreign donors are European, mainly from Germany and Scandinavia. To verify that non-European donors did not bias the results, we removed persons born outside Europe (1.8%) and repeated the analysis. This did not impact the p-values, or ORs of the associations (Table S5).
Secretor status is determined by the FUT2 gene, where individuals with at least one functional allele, called secretors, produce the 1-2-fucosyltransferase 2 enzyme. This enzyme has a crucial role to play in determining if ABH antigens are present in body fluid of the individual. Furthermore, Lewis phenotypes are determined by both the FUT2 and FUT3 genes. Having at least one functional FUT3 allele leads to the production of an 1-3/4-fucosyltransferase which synthesizes the Lea and Leb antigens from type 1 (Lec) precursor and H type 1 (Led) glycolipids, respectively. In the absence of a functional FUT2-encoded enzyme, the FUT3-encoded enzyme will convert almost all precursor into Lea and result in the Le(a + bÀ) non-secretor phenotype, while its presence will result in the Le(a-b+) secretor phenotype. The absence of a functional FUT3 allele on the other hand results in the Le(a-bÀ) phenotype regardless of the FUT2-derived enzyme.
Judging from our results, there seem to be a protective effect associated with having the Lea blood group antigen. This is not related to Lewis antibodies interacting with SARS-CoV-2, in a similar manner to the one supposed in the ABO blood group, since Lewis antibodies are irregular, rare, and almost exclusively found in Le(a-bÀ) individuals,32 which are also the rarest phenotype (8%). In our models, Le(a-bÀ) individuals did not have a different infection susceptibility, which also does not support involvement of Lewis antibodies.
In the Lewis blood group, the Lea and Leb antigens are mostly mutually exclusive. Therefore, there is a chance that Leb is actually conferring a higher infection susceptibility, but remains insignificant in our model because we have fewer Leb antigen test results. In that

case, the protective effect of Lea in our model might just be due to Lea excluding Leb. If we enrich our data with hypothetical antigen tests where each positive Lea test would generate a negative Leb test and vice versa, and rerun the Lea and Leb models, then both will indeed become statistically significant, with opposing ORs as expected. This would indeed mimic the studies which have indicated non-secretors to be protected and secretors to be worse off.8,9 However, we choose to base our Lewis results on actual serological test data, so the enriched data models aren't included in this study.
The mutually exclusive nature of Lea and Leb makes it difficult to conclude which antigen is directly responsible for our SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility findings, or if they merely signal a certain secretor or non-secretor status.
However, the secretor model does not report such an association. This could be due to 8% of our cohort having Lewis phenotype Le(a-b-), for whom secretor status is not a factor. These 8% could reduce the link between Lewis phenotype and secretor status enough to require a much larger cohort to reach above the significance threshold. It is worth noting that, although not significant, the secretor susceptibility model does report an elevated OR for secretors, which is what we would expect. Since both the secretor and Lewis models have large cohorts, the fact that Lewis is significant, but secretor is not, hints that susceptibility might be more directly linked to Lewis phenotype, and not secretor status. While other published studies have reported links between SARS-CoV-2 infection and secretor status,8-10 our cohort size for both Lewis and secretor status dwarfs them all by a substantial degree.
It is worth noting that there are known cases of viruses and bacteria using Lewis antigens as receptors for cell invasion, with resulting higher susceptibility to the disease in question. Lewis antigens aren't produced by the red blood cells themselves, but rather secreted by epithelial cells, and subsequently absorbed passively onto the RBC surface. The specific binding of norovirus viruslike particles to ABO and Lewis antigens has been demonstrated.33 Norovirus uses secreted Lewis antigens for attachment to human epithelial cells.34-36 This favors a theory of Leb perhaps acting as a mediator for SARSCoV-2 infection in a similar manner. In addition, both Lewis and secretor status associate to microbiota of the mucosal surfaces which could explain the association to infection susceptibility.37,38 The present results provide sufficient evidence of a potential link between SARSCoV-2 and the Lewis blood group to warrant future investigations exploring the association in greater detail and testing these theories experimentally.
We did not find any other associations between blood groups and SARS-CoV-2. This questions the validity of

previous findings of an association to the Rh blood group.11,12,14,15
Two COVID-19 severity results worth discussing are blood type O vs AB, which was significant (p = .008), and secretor status, which was close to being significant (p = .06). Blood type AB is a rare phenotype (5%), which reduces confidence in that result. It's also worth noting that type A and B, which are more common phenotypes, do not report significant results for COVID-19 severity. Some meta-analysis studies report a potential link between COVID-19 severity and ABO phenotype,6 while others do not.2 The secretor/severity cohort is both small, and has an OR of 0.68, which is in conflict with other studies.8,9 Given the above facts, we do not feel confident in interpreting these findings either way.
5.1 | Strength and limitations
This study benefits greatly from having access to a large, national cohort. The SARS-CoV-2 test results were registered by a centralized authority, which circumvents potential confounding biases. The entire cohort, being composed of blood donors, ensures a degree of homogeneity among cases and controls, thereby circumventing other potential confounders including, for example, undetected SARS-CoV-2 cases.2 We have adjusted for the most common confounders in the analysis.
There are arguments to be made in favor of including other covariates often used in such association studies, and one such covariate is Charlson comorbidity score.39 However, it could be argued that while the inclusion of a Charlson score might be advantageous in studies of normal background population cohorts, it is not likely to make much of a difference for a blood donor study. Blood donors are known to be healthier than the background population, in a phenomenon called the healthy donor effect.40 In an earlier published study,41 only 3.5% of 37,808 DBDS participants were found to have a Charlson score above 0.
The fact that blood donors are known to be healthier than the background population, likely makes obtaining sufficient statistical strength for severity and long COVID-19 studies more difficult. As such, while we can be reasonably assured that our findings regarding severity and long COVID-19 are internally consistent within blood donors, the higher healthiness of such a cohort might cast doubts on the external validity of these results when applied to the general population. This could potentially be why we could not replicate the findings of other smaller studies.8,9,13,42 However, the differences in our findings might also be due to different thresholds for

admitting patients to hospitals, and in the way we define COVID-19 severity.
5.2 | Conclusion
In this study, we found strong associations between ABO and Lewis blood groups and SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, whereas the other investigated blood group systems did not display such an association. Larger studies of these blood groups might yet find other SARS-CoV-2 associations; however, these are expected to be small given the large sample sizes in our study.
In our long COVID-19 and disease severity models, the cohort sizes were comparatively small and could warrant bigger cohort studies in the future for a more definite conclusion regarding links to COVID-19. This is especially true for the Lewis blood group and secretor status.
