Introduction
Following the inaugural conference, held in 2005 and founded by D.J. Weiss (University of Vermont) and D. Prockop (Texas A&M University), the eighth biennial conference, held at the University of Vermont, provided the most current discussion of recent advances in the field of lung stem cells, cellular therapies and bioengineering (figure 1). For the second successive conference D.E. Wagner (Lund University, Sweden) chaired, with A.L. Ryan (Firth) (University of Southern California) and L. Ikonomou (Boston University) serving as co-vice chairs.
Application of new and emerging technologies to lung stem cell biology and regeneration has led to exciting advances in the field. Two central themes that emerged at the 2019 conference were: 1) innovation and application of new technology for advancing basic and translational lung biology and 2) the impact of niche/microenvironment on cellular regulation. The necessity for basic science studies to enhance fundamental understanding of lung regeneration and to design innovative translational studies to move the field closer to regenerative strategies for acute and chronic lung diseases was also reiterated.
As a cogent example of evolving technologies, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is rapidly becoming a technique used in research laboratories all over the world. While the value of scRNA-seq in hypothesis formation cannot be understated, further advances in informatics techniques for utilisation of the data is essential to gain a greater understanding of potential functional implications. The capacity for data integration across multiple species and collaborative real-time data exploration in multiple laboratories was highlighted with the use of three-dimensional (3D) visualisation of datasets, enabling physical interaction with the data without the constraints of two-dimensional (2D) space [1]. New computational approaches to data mining have also enabled systems-level approaches for discovering putative ligand-receptor interactions and the identification of cell signalling pathways and networks [2]. These new techniques hold great promise for improving our understanding of lung regenerative biology and its potential for clinical translation.
Recent developments in ex vivo cell expansion techniques, improved physiological 3D models and culturing techniques, greater understanding of endogenous lung stem and progenitor cell behaviour and improved pluripotent stem cell differentiation protocols all increase the hope for success in the pursuit of functional long-term cell engraftment into the lung and the generation of functional tissue for transplantation [3, 4]. New technologies such as scRNA-seq have helped elucidate the substantial cellular heterogeneity within the human lung. scRNA-seq also opens new doors for further understanding how similar ex vivo cultured primary cells, such as airway basal epithelial cells and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived lung cells are to the resident endogenous cells of the adult human lung. This remains an area of continued active discussion and investigation. Furthermore, differences in protocols across laboratories continue to make direct comparisons challenging.
For cell engraftment to be plausible in the human lung it is essential to have suitable models for pre-clinical evaluation prior to translation into humans. The use of the ferret as a model for cystic fibrosis (CF) was discussed at this conference in the context of the lung basal stem cells and their niche post-transplantation. Essential pre-clinical investigation into how to deliver cells and how to access the appropriate endogenous niche or how to mobilise endogenous cells are all being pursued in hope for repairing the airway epithelium to a functional status. Furthermore, understanding the complexity of the regulation of lung stem and progenitor cells by their direct, in vivo, niche is vital to the success of any

FIGURE 1 Scientific advances and application of innovative and new technologies and techniques in human lung regeneration. The Stem Cells, Cell Therapies and Bioengineering in Lung Biology and Diseases 2019 conference was the eighth in a series of biennial conferences focusing on advances in biotechnology and bioengineering, endogenous lung stem/progenitor cells and cell-based therapies, increasing our knowledge of lung stem cell populations, and edging closer to addressing the barriers toward making cell therapy feasible in the epithelial and vascular compartments of the lung. Significant advances since the last conference in 2017, are summarised in table 1.

mechanism for restoration of homeostasis in a diseased lung. To this end, greater understanding of the impact of cell-cell, cell-niche and cell-matrix interactions within the normal and diseased lung is needed.
While the cell therapy field still faces many challenges, the clinical translation of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based therapies is an active area for respiratory focused translational studies. The field has been held back largely due to a scarcity in reliable and rapid disease-specific potency assays allowing statistically relevant prediction of therapeutic efficacy [5-8]. An emerging focus is on the immunomodulatory phenotypes that MSC-derived exosomes may exert in the diseased lung. Further functional elucidation of the role of extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, may be instrumental in identification of novel therapeutic targets and mechanisms. Continued progress in this area will probably be dependent upon fully understanding the impact of disease-dependent changes in the lung microenvironment. Despite progress in understanding the biology underpinning the efficacy of cell therapies in pre-clinical models, including understanding of how the microenvironment influences effective cell therapy [9], there is currently no clinically approved cellular therapy for lung disease. However, there remains an alarming rate of patients receiving unproven and unregulated cellular interventions, which raises a number of clinical, ethical and regulatory concerns [10-12].
Importantly, the 2019 conference continued discussion to develop an actionable agenda for the prohibition of unproven and unlicensed stem cell therapies that was initiated at the 2017 conference [13]. All of the above-mentioned topics were featured in selected symposia at the conference and presented as active topics for discussion. The conference again was paired with a "hands-on" pre-conference workshop focusing on training in state-of-the-art methods in stem cells, cell therapies and bioengineering. A range of existing and emerging techniques relevant to the field of lung bioengineering and regeneration were featured such as: decellularisation of whole lungs, preparation of precision cut lung slices (PCLSs), ex vivo culture techniques, four-dimensional imaging techniques, gene editing and virtual reality techniques for visualising scRNA-seq data. An additional new pre-conference workshop was introduced this year focusing on professional skill development in technology, commercialisation and business communication for academic researchers. The 2019 conference concluded with a series of survey questions addressing key theme areas of the conference. This report summarises the topics featured throughout the conference, highlighting key areas for continued innovation and funding to enable the field to successfully advance. The full pre-conference and conference programme, as well as submitted abstracts, is included as a supplement.

Session I. Understanding lung stem cells in the digital age
The development of scRNA-seq [14] has revolutionised our capacity to evaluate cellular heterogeneity in complex tissues. This capability has led to the discovery of a rare cell population of ionocytes in the lung [15, 16]. By evaluating lungs from multiple species with scRNA-seq, RAREDON et al. [2] (Yale University, USA) leveraged a systems-level approach to identify highly conserved cell signalling pathways. Potential ligand-receptor interactions were mined to identify these pathways, which are predicted to regulate adult lung homeostasis. Such approaches can now be applied to develop a translational roadmap identifying key regulatory mechanisms in homeostasis and disease, as well as for tissue engineering. scRNA-seq has further revolutionised our capabilities to study cellular mechanisms of lung development [17-20] and disease [18, 19, 21, 22].
scRNA-seq data is usually visualised in 2D space using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) or uniform manifold approximation and projection. CellexalVR, developed by S. Soneji (Lund University, Sweden), has expanded scRNA-seq data visualisation to 3D by developing an open-source virtual reality (VR) environment based on video-game technology [1]. The 3D cell maps can be moved and rotated like physical objects and hand-selected groups of cells can be compared directly in the same VR environment. CellexalVR represents a new way of working with large datasets without space constraints and can be utilised anywhere by multiple users simultaneously, thereby enriching collaborative data exploration.
scRNA-seq is also being applied to study regenerative processes. LEIGH and co-workers [23] (Harvard University, USA) leveraged this technology to study the dynamic cellular landscape during axolotl (Salamander) limb regeneration and homeostasis. scRNA-seq on various stages of this process were used to create computational predictions for the progression of limb regeneration over time. Cellular dynamics can also be computationally evaluated using scRNA-seq over pseudo-time. Pseudo-time analysis mechanisms were first introduced in 2014 [24, 25], followed by many other such programs [26]. In the Velocity method, data on spliced and unspliced mRNA sequences are leveraged to extrapolate dynamic lineage relationships among cells and predict progenitor cell fate [27].
Two major challenges remain with current scRNA-seq analyses. First, scRNA-seq data usually lack spatial orientation within the analysed tissue, as single cells are sequenced from a dissociated "soup". This can be resolved using new "spatialomics" techniques, such as multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridisation, laser capture microscopy coupled with Smart-seq and deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing [28-33]. Second, functional assays are necessary for verifying gene expression. This often involves histological staining or the use of fluorescent reporters [34]. Nonetheless, scRNA-seq particularly benefits the lung community in resolving significant cellular heterogeneity and plasticity in homeostasis and disease.
Session II. Building up the complexity of the lung: assessing lung stem and progenitor cells using 3D models
Efforts to recreate 3D tissues have been reinvigorated by 3D printing technology in the biomedical field, using biomaterial inks and bioinks, combining various biocompatible materials and cells, to create tissue models of hearts, blood vessels and tracheas. These printed constructs recapitulate key structural, mechanical and biological properties of native tissues. A functional tracheal graft, for example, must be biocompatible, bioactive and able to maintain proper structure and mechanical strength over time. FEINBERG and co-workers [35] (Carnegie Mellon University, USA) developed a 3D bioprinting technique, known as Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels (FRESH), in 2015 and presented an update to this technology. The FRESH system uses a bioink of collagen, or other materials, embedded in a thick slurry of gelatine microparticles and water. The new system is now able to print collagen with greater resolution and fidelity. This technique has been successfully applied to bio-print human heart structures at scales ranging from capillaries to a model of the entire organ [36] and FEINBERG's group is working to apply FRESH 2.0 methodology to bioprinted tracheas for paediatric patients. A potential pitfall to build up a human lung from, either using 3D printing techniques or decellularised lung scaffolds, is to generate sufficiently large quantities of progenitors or the appropriate mature cell type to achieve this endeavour.
2D culture and animal models have long been used to study human diseases; however, these conventional models have several limitations. Traditional 2D cultures lack proper spatial cues and cell complexity. Animal models, especially mouse models have been extremely useful in advancing our understanding of lung repair and regeneration. A Wnt-responsive alveolar epithelial progenitor lineage within the alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell population has been shown to act as a major facultative progenitor cell in mouse distal lung and human alveolar organoids [4]. However, given the significant difference between the human and mouse lung, especially in the distal airway, mouse models rarely completely recapitulating all aspects of the pathogenesis of human disease. As an alternative strategy, organoid and 3D cultures derived from human

cells and tissue have been used more frequently. GOTOH and co-workers [37, 38] (Kyoto University, Japan) used carboxypeptidase M (CPM) to isolate ventralised anterior foregut endoderm cells, derived from human iPSCs, with lung competence. CPM+ cells can generate alveolar epithelial cells as well as airway epithelium in 3D cultures. Using this system, they modelled Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) type 2, an autosomal recessive disorder with dysfunctional lysosome-related organelles in AT2 cells, in alveolar spheroids derived from human iPSC generated from a patient with HPS type 2. This recapitulated key human disease features, including altered distribution, size and secretion pattern of the lamellar bodies, highlighting the potential of use of human pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar spheroid models for studying alveolar diseases [39]. GOTOH and co-workers also presented the generation of abnormal multi-ciliated airway spheroid structures using iPSCs derived from primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) patients, demonstrating that this model may provide a new diagnostic and research platform for difficult cases of PCD. GOTOH and co-worker's research complements that of other groups [40, 41] who have been able to sort CD47high/CD26low cells to purify NKX2.1+ lung epithelial progenitor cells capable of directed differentiation into alveolar spheres. iPSC-derived alveolar spheres have been used to model genetic alveolar disease using CRISPR/Cas9 [40]. Using reporter cell lines and scRNA-seq to map fate trajectories, they have demonstrated lung epithelial lineage heterogeneity in iPSC-derived alveolar spheres [42] and fate divergence with some cells capable of generating AT2 cells, while others switch to an alternative non-lung endodermal fate [43].
Organ-on-chip technologies are increasingly powerful in modelling lung stem cell biology. ZAMPROGNO and co-workers [44] (University of Bern, Switzerland) presented a new alveolar chip design. This alveolus-on-a-chip improves the ability to model the microenvironment and the complex architecture of the lung parenchyma. Endothelial cells can be co-cultured with patient-derived lung alveolar epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface (ALI) and can be subjected to physiological stretch to mimic breathing. Although the thickness of membranes used in the chips varies from 4.5±0.8 µm to 11.5±1.2 µm, thicker than the alveolar wall measures 0.5-0.7 µm in vivo [45], this model reproduces some key features of the lung alveolar environment in terms of structure, customisable extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, barrier functions and dynamic microenvironment, providing a promising tool to evaluate interactions between the lung ECM and cells.
Session III. Stem cell niche interactions
Endogenous lung progenitor cells have a critical and dynamic interaction with their niche. The self-renewal and differentiation of lung progenitor cells are regulated by neighbouring epithelial cells, stromal cells (including fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and endothelium) and immune cells. Fibroblasts upregulate the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 following injury of the airway epithelium to promote ciliated cell differentiation from basal stem cells in mice [46]. A specific mesenchymal lineage expressing Axin2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA) could provide signals including IL-6, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) antagonists that promote the self-renewal and differentiation of AT2s [18]. S. Reynolds (Nationwide Children's Hospital, USA) highlighted the role of the niche in lung tissue injury and repair. She posed important questions about the capacity to repair a defective niche and how this can be used to enhance regenerative potential in the human lung. Lung progenitor cells can exit, move, and return to their niche and also create an entirely new niche, underscoring the dynamic interactions between cells and their environment. The critical role of immune cells in the regenerative tissue niche was also highlighted, a topic discussed further in Session VII.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an intractable interstitial lung disease with poor prognosis. Lung transplantation is often the only therapeutic option for IPF patients. IPF can be divided into sporadic and familiar IPF. Around 30% of genetic mutations causative for familial IPF have been identified, however a genetic underpinning for sporadic IPF has yet to be discovered. scRNA-seq offers the opportunity to examine cells and cellular interactions between cell populations in regions of fibrosis [47]. Through this, a novel population of pro-fibrotic alveolar macrophages has been discovered exclusively in patients with fibrosis [47]. In a different study a population of CX3CR1+SiglecF+ transitional macrophages were found to localise to the fibrotic niche and play a key role in driving pro-fibrotic cellular signalling pathways [48]. Age-related mechanisms, including epithelial cellular senescence have been proposed as pathogenic drivers, as the lung alveolar epithelium is gradually obliterated and replaced with nonfunctional fibrotic tissue in IPF. This is proposed to occur due to repetitive injury to the alveolar epithelium and an inability to properly restore function in patients with IPF [49]. LEHMANN and co-workers [50] (Comprehensive Pneumology Centre Munich, Germany) showed that there is a loss of alveolar epithelial cells in aged mice. This loss correlates with an elevation of canonical Wnt signalling in the lung epithelium of these mice. Accumulation of active -catenin in these cells led to cellular senescence in vitro. In line with recent evidence that IPF is a disease with accelerated ageing of the lung, a fibrotic mouse lung following bleomycin administration and fibrotic human lung tissue had more senescence in AT2 cells as compared

to healthy controls. AT2 cell senescence may be a mechanism detrimental to lung repair and contributes to the formation of fibrosis. Senolytic drugs, agents that selectively induce apoptosis of senescent cells are capable of clearing senescent cells and reducing fibrotic markers and therefore may be a viable therapeutic option for IPF patients. Studies in bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mice have shown an abundance of senescence biomarkers and the secretome of senescent fibroblasts, that was fibrogenic, could selectively be suppressed by a senolytic cocktail comprising dasatinib plus quercetin alleviating IPF-related dysfunction [51, 52]. Pilot studies in humans support feasibility of this approach and it will be interesting to follow developments as controlled human trials progress [52].
The niche and tissue of origin can also have important, long lasting impact on cells isolated from these tissues. Y. Yuan (Yale University, USA) presented methods for the purification of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells from the lower lymphatics of rat lungs (LLPMECs). While morphologically homogeneous, at least six heterogenous endothelial populations were identified in the native pulmonary vasculature by scRNA-seq. The LLPMECs could be used to repopulate the vasculature of decellularised rat lungs, providing a purified cell candidate for regeneration of the pulmonary microvasculature. A combination of purified progenitors with the greatest regenerative potential together with an ECM of native lung morphology were key to this successful tissue regeneration. These sessions further highlighted the importance of understanding precise stem cell and niche interactions for sustained tissue regeneration.
Session IV. Towards the development of new therapies using lung stem cells for cystic fibrosis
Recent progress has led to the development of drug combinations which can restore CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel function in 90% of CF patients; unfortunately 7-10% of patients do not produce any appreciable amount of CFTR protein (e.g. due to premature stop mutations or aberrant splicing), requiring alternative therapeutic approaches. One option is to correct disease-causing CFTR mutations via editing in a CF patient's own airway basal stem cells. Gene-editing approaches themselves still have a number of limitations to be overcome prior to their in vivo application including avoiding the host immune response, delivery to the desired cell types within the lung, editing with high-efficiency and precision with no off-target effects. Such limitations may be overcome by ex vivo editing and cellular selection; however, ex vivo expansion of lung stem cells comes with its own challenges. GREANEY and co-workers [53] (Yale University, USA) presented data comparing the regenerative potential of rat tracheal basal cells, expanded in vitro using pharmacological expansion techniques, across four different differentiation platforms: organoids, ALI, decellularised trachea and lung. By benchmarking these engineered samples to native rat tracheal and lung epithelial scRNA-seq samples, analogous populations were compared transcriptomically and a population of cells primed for differentiation was identified. Interestingly, the differentiation capacity was heavily dependent upon the model system with even submerged cultures on engineered trachea generating a more robust ciliated epithelium defined by consistent generation of a pseudo-stratified epithelium and mucociliary differentiation. This study highlights the importance of niche and ECM composition on differentiation capacity of basal cells. A significant effort within the lung field is currently being devoted to scRNA-seq analysis of basal cell populations present in the lungs of individuals with CF and to compare their frequency, their transcriptome and their biological activity with that of basal cells from non-CF lungs. G. Carraro (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, USA) presented intriguing scRNA-seq data indicating that there are distinct classes of lung basal cells pre-disposed different differentiation fates. It should be noted that such detailed transcriptional characterisation (e.g. cycling status), not only of basal cells, but also other airway epithelial cell types within the CF lung will be invaluable in guiding efforts for in vivo CFTR gene editing.
Another potential source of CFTR-corrected lung stem cells for transplantation, would be to first derive iPSCs from CF patient cells, perform CFTR gene editing and then differentiate to airway basal cells in sufficient quantity for transplantation. CFTR editing has been previously achieved in CF patient-iPSCs which, when subsequently differentiated, exhibited restored CFTR function [54, 55]. J. Mahoney (CF Foundation Therapeutics Laboratory, USA) presented progress toward generating iPSC-derived basal cells utilising a double fluorescent reporter system in which a knock-in NKX2.1-GFP reporter was utilised to read out commitment to lung epithelial fate and a knock-in TP63-tdTomato reporter to identify the development of basal cells. As primary airway basal cells can develop into an airway epithelium at an ALI, iPSC-derived basal cells are also being functionally evaluated in this culture system. Once such differentiation protocols are robust and reproducible, significant work will be required to assess how best to deliver and engraft such cells in the affected human lung.
As we move toward evaluating the in vivo engraftment potential of basal and other airway epithelial progenitor cells, the need for an animal model that reflects disease progression in humans will be essential. LYNCH and co-workers [56, 57] (University of Iowa, USA) presented data on an orthotopic left lung

https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00123-2020

transplant model in ferrets, which can also be used to provide a robust model for CF. Ferrets share similarities in lung function and architecture with humans and CF ferrets develop airway obstruction, accumulate thick mucus and develop inflammation. The orthotopic ferret lung transplant model develops the entire spectrum of chronic lung allograft dysfunction pathology, including both obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), characterised by inflammation and irreversible fibrosis obstructing airflow in the small airways [58], and restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS), characterised by a persistent decline in lung capacity due to diffuse alveolar damage and presence of intra-alveolar fibroblasts [59, 60]. Further development and use of larger animal models, such as the ferret, will be pertinent to the robust pre-clinical evaluation of cellular therapies for the human lung.
Session V. Careers in stem cells, cell therapies and lung bioengineering
Following in the steps of previous conferences, there was a dedicated focus on highlighting the research, mentorship and training of junior investigators in the field of stem cells, bioengineering and cell therapy. This session provided valuable information on academic career support and early career development [5, 6]. There were targeted sessions to discuss issues of gender equity in science, the challenges of starting a laboratory, including the funding and financial management aspects, publishing and reviewing for medical journals and the pros and cons of pre-print servers. Complete details of this session and further resources are provided in the data supplement.
Session VI. Bridging cell and tissue-derived products to market: regulation and commercialisation of regenerative medicine products
Regenerative medicine is undergoing unprecedented growth as witnessed by the large number of cell- and gene-based therapies (CGTs) currently under evaluation in clinical trials and the over 40 products with marketing authorisation worldwide [61]. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates it will receive more than 200 investigational new drug (IND) applications in this area by 2020 and anticipates approving 10-20 CGTs a year by 2025 [62]. This growth can be partly attributed to the introduction of the regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation that simplifies the criteria for expedited clinical testing and allows for multicentre data collection and pooling using one clinical trial protocol [63].
The rapid expansion of the regenerative medicine product pipeline introduces regulatory and manufacturing challenges. Large quantities of good manufacturing practice-compliant cellular products and/or gene vectors will be required for pre-clinical and clinical testing, along with guidance to navigate the new regulatory landscape. A publicly funded initiative to overcome such challenges is the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-funded Production Assistance for Cellular Therapies (PACT) [64]. PACT provides manufacturing support for pre-clinical testing and phase I/II clinical trials, regulatory assistance and streamlines US FDA-compliant data collection. R. LINDBLAD, [65, 66] PACT Director, reported that PACT has supported cell products of programmatic interest to the NHLBI, ranging from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes for acute myocardial infarction to MSCs for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In parallel, PACT continues to provide regulatory support through seminars, gap analysis for regulatory compliance and assistance with pre-IND interactions with the US FDA and IND filing.
A regenerative medicine product that exemplifies the enormous clinical potential of CGTs and the long process from basic research to proven therapy is chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell gene therapy [67]. CAR-T therapies are a form of adaptive T-cell transfer (ACT) for cancer therapy and present an improvement over other ACTs, due to their major histocompatibility complex-independent target recognition. A CAR is created by combining an antigen recognition domain of antibody with intracellular signalling domains into a single chimeric protein. CARs encoded by lentiviral vectors then stably transduce autologous patient T-cells, which are expanded ex vivo and transferred back to patients. Although the creation of CARs was first described in the 1980s [68, 69] and the first CAR-T clinical trial took place in 1997, it was only recently that CAR-T therapies gained traction, following high remission rates of treated patients and low long-term toxicities. Two CAR-T therapies have obtained marketing authorisation in several jurisdictions (USA, European Union, Switzerland, Australia, Canada and Japan) [61] and are currently under testing in hundreds of clinical trials worldwide. LEVINE and co-workers [70] (University of Pennsylvania, USA), co-inventor of CAR-T therapies, detailed challenges remaining for widespread implementation of CAR-T therapies, including variability in patient-derived raw material, expansion of treated conditions and manufacturing shortages for clinical-grade lentiviral vectors.
Another facet of regenerative medicine is the in vitro generation of tissues to ultimately restore organ/ tissue function in patients. Decellularised organ scaffolds have been studied for this purpose but emerging technologies, such as 3D bioprinting, are attractive alternatives. Intense research efforts are directed at developing biomaterials that support various cell types, are compatible with 3D-printing techniques and

encourage vascularisation. According to M. DeSantis (Lund University, Sweden), hybrid-hydrogels consisting of alginate and decellularised lung ECM meet many of these criteria and have been used as a bioink, combined with human bronchial epithelial cells and extruded into airway-like geometries using the FRESH technique pioneered by FEINBERG and co-workers [71] (Session II). Overall, this session demonstrated the impressive progress in bringing safe and effective CGTs to patients. It also highlighted the challenges ahead, including development of innovative and cost-effective regenerative medicine treatments that enable adoption in clinical practice.
Session VII. Immunomodulation via cell therapy and cell-derived extracellular vesicles
Clinical translation of MSC-based therapies remains an area of intensive study in respiratory medicine. There are still many questions to be answered about their biology and mechanisms of action to safely harness their full clinical therapeutic potential [72]. Work from THEBAUD's group [5-8] (Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Canada) is focused on the development of human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs for the treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Challenges still faced by the cell therapy field include optimisation and standardisation of the cell manufacturing processes, such as: 1) the cell source (e.g. bone marrow, cord tissue, placenta); 2) improved isolation, culture, expansion and cryopreservation techniques; 3) evaluation of cryopreserved versus fresh cellular products; 4) autologous versus allogeneic strategies; and 5) cellular versus cell-free delivery. Several assays were proposed in the session to address a lack of a reliable and rapid disease-specific potency assay that would enable prediction of the therapeutic efficacy of cell therapies. Recent advances in 3D lung organoid culture present a promising approach for evaluating personalised therapeutic interventions on patient-derived material [73-75].
Another exciting research avenue is the recognition that MSCs exert their therapeutic effects through the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs). S. KOUREMBANAS' [76-78] group (Boston Children's Hospital, USA) has been investigating the therapeutic potential of MSC-derived exosomes (MEx) (the smaller-sized EV fraction that contains proteins and miRNA). Their work has demonstrated that MEx improve histological and functional outcomes in experimental models of pulmonary hypertension, BPD and lung fibrosis. Interestingly, MEx treatment modulated lung and bone marrow monocyte populations towards an anti-inflammatory M2-like phenotype [77]. MEx-based therapeutics represent a promising innovative approach to treat lung diseases without the safety concerns associated with live cell treatments. Data presented by J. Dutra Silva (Queen's University Belfast, UK) indicated the potential for MSC EVs to improve epithelial-endothelial barrier functions in pre-clinical models of ARDS. This work highlighted the importance of functional mitochondria in the EV preparations and further emphasised the importance of proper characterisation and standardisation of the cell products and understanding the mechanisms of their therapeutic effects. Elucidation of the functional role of the specific EV contents (e.g. miRNAs, proteins, mitochondria) may lead to identification of novel therapeutic targets. A certain caution should be excised as recent studies using xenograft tumour models have suggested that MSC EVs may be associated with increased proliferation and decreases apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells. The mechanism was demonstrated to be via EV-transmitted miR-410 and suggests that modifications of MSC-EV may be essential to decrease unwanted therapeutic side effects [79].
J. Collins (Erasmus University Medical Center, Netherlands), discussed the involvement of the endogenous lung MSCs in pathological changes leading to BPD and the role of microbiome in shaping endogenous MSC populations. Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that disease microenvironment can influence MSC behaviours and consequently therapeutic potential [9, 80, 81]. Therefore, a better understanding of the lung injury microenvironment and how it alters functional properties of the cell-based therapies is essential to their effective clinical translation and will be an important area of further investigation.
Session IX. New strategies for cellular delivery and regenerative medicine
Understanding how cells or cellular derivatives, such as EVs or ECM, influence cell behaviour in the lung is central to designing cellular therapies for acute and chronic lung diseases. As previously discussed, MSCs have potential therapeutic benefit in the treatment of several lung diseases [5, 9, 72]. PATI and co-workers [82, 83] (University of California San Francisco, USA) has shown that MSC actions are mediated by different effectors in different diseases. In the context of traumatic brain injury, for example, TIMP3 was identified as a mediator of MSC function; however, in acute lung injury, the positive effects of MSCs are TIMP3 independent. Similarly, while some of the MSCs effects can be phenocopied by using MSC exosomes, others appear to be cell mediated. In addition, some of the effects observed in vivo could not be recapitulated in vitro, suggesting the involvement of an intermediate cell. Understanding of these and other mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of MSCs are needed to further tailor treatment efficacy and safety to the specific patient and disease.

Chronic lung allograft dysfunction presents as RAS and OB and limits long-term survival following lung transplant. Recently, a depletion of endogenous lung basal stem cells was described, limiting repair in these situations. The mechanisms driving stem cell depletion remain a major challenge in the field. Using a ferret model of OB, PAREKH and co-workers [84] (University of Iowa, USA) demonstrated that both small and large airways are affected in OB, a disease previously believed to affect only distal airways. Upon OB development, basal epithelial cells are diminished from small and large airways and submucosal glands. Delivery of ex vivo expanded lung basal stem cells showed promising results regenerating surface airway epithelium, suggesting that application of basal lung stem cells upon lung transplantation may offset the disruption of endogenous airway stem cell niches and prolong patient survival.
An alternate approach to donor lung transplantation is the generation of bioartificial lungs by 3D bioprinting. The development of 3D-printable bioinks from extracellular matrix is a promising approach that harnesses the potential of the ECM to instruct cell behaviour [85]. An example of this was presented by GALLIGER and co-workers [85] (University of Minnesota, USA) who use ECM derived from porcine trachea to develop bioinks that are capable of inducing neocartilage production in MSCs. Different extraction techniques were analysed for their effects if incorporated into hydrogels. A urea-based extraction improves the compressive modulus of the final 3D bioprinted tracheal constructs and allows for cartilage differentiation and collagen II production by incorporated human MSCs. Further investigations into cellular remodelling in long-term cultures are warranted, exploring functional properties of the artificial cartilage.
Session X. Visualising lung regeneration
The adult lung is a relatively quiescent organ; however, upon injury, different regional-specific stem and progenitor cells interact with tissue-resident and recruited immune cells to orchestrate repair. However, mechanisms underlying such regeneration (and its dysregulation in disease) are still poorly understood [86, 87]. Pioneers, such as WEIBEL and co-workers [88], paved the way for using imaging techniques to advance our understanding of lung regeneration. Early studies relied mostly on static 2D imaging methods, such as electron microscopy and histology, which are not suitable for live imaging and therefore limited in their ability to visualise lung regeneration. The lung is a particularly difficult organ to image at high cell and tissue resolution because it is shielded by the thoracic cage, filled with air creating artefacts at the air-tissue interface, and is a dynamic organ. One approach to visualise cell interactions and/or differentiation in a more in vivo like environment is to isolate and culture cells in 3D scaffolds (synthetic or naturally derived) and image regenerative processes overtime. M. Ho (Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Canada) established a novel co-culture model of iPSC-derived smooth muscle cells (iSMCs) from healthy patients or those with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) combined with endothelial cells (ECs) in Matrigel to examine the role of this cellular crosstalk in endothelial tube formation. Co-culture of normal ECs with LAM iSMCs resulted in EC network degradation and apoptosis, which was not seen for iSMCs derived from healthy patients (unpublished data).
Using co-culture models has many advantages, such as control over cellular complexity and the ability to use human cells, but does not fully represent the complexity of native tissue. Although technically challenging, in situ or ex vivo imaging of the lung is a more ideal scenario for visualising lung regeneration. One recent example of the power of this approach is the study by LI et al. [89], in which both in situ and ex vivo imaging of murine fetal lungs was used to explore the link between mechanical and chemical cues in lung development. During the session, GUSAROVA [90, 91] (Columbia University, USA) highlighted recent technical advances for visualisation of acute lung injury and repair in ex vivo, blood-perfused mouse lungs using live confocal microscopy imaging. This setup allows for administration of drugs and other compounds during imaging; however, the system still lacks movements associated with normal breathing. Alveoli could be visualised at high magnification to give insights insight into mechanisms of injury and repair in the alveolar epithelium, such as the dynamic regulation of proinflammatory receptors by the cytosolic calcium and cellular actin. An emerging alternative for high resolution optical imaging of native lung tissue is the use of PCLSs. PCLSs contain most native cell types and retain the tissue architecture and ECM of the native lung [92]. Furthermore, PCLSs can be generated from human tissue and there are currently no other techniques that allow for the visualisation of human lung tissue over time at this resolution. C. Dean (Imperial College London, UK), presented her group's recent work using PCLSs from post-natal mice to visualise alveologenesis. Using a bright-field fluorescent microscope-based setup, they were able to image the lung tissue with high spatiotemporal resolution and observed several key stages of alveolar formation: 1) highly mobile epithelial cells, 2) cell clustering, and 3) hollowing [93]. While confocal and conventional fluorescence microscopy allow for imaging lung regeneration at high resolution, it is hampered by difficulties in penetrating thick tissue samples, long imaging acquisition times and phototoxicity. One emerging imaging technique that overcomes many of these limitations is light-sheet microscopy, which was recently used to visualise nanoparticle deposition in

TABLE 1 Conference summary, recommendations and focus areas. Many of the recommendations from our previous conference remain valid with priorities for research focus and funding recommendations [95]. The current table comprises new recommendations arising specifically from the 2019 conference
Basic Science: Analysis and Visualisation of Endogenous Lung Stem Cells · Continue advancement of the utility of scRNA-seq through 3D visualisation of the datasets ("spatialomics") in conjunction with spatial
transcriptomics and application of the technology and data integration across multiple species. · Continue progression in applying a systems-level approach to discover interactions through mining of scRNA-seq data to identify
fundamental cell signalling pathways and networks in homeostasis and disease. · Identification of additional cell surface markers that characterise lung cell populations for use in visualisation and sorting techniques
through evaluation of current datasets in the human lung. · Improve access to bioinformaticians with a biological background/understanding of lung disease was a limiting factor in the use of
scRNA-seq. Efforts should be made to increase awareness of available courses to aid young scientists in building a background in bioinformatics (e.g. those hosted by the National Bioinformatics Infrastructure in Sweden/SciLife and MIT/Broad Institute in the USA). · Encourage incorporation of virtual reality technology as a core facility within universities to facilitate worldwide collaborations using interactive data evaluation. · Improve availability of funding for core services or the development of a cryopreserved biobank for PCLSs to be an available resource for all lung researchers. Suggestion to develop a collaborative RFA. · Establish techniques for light-sheet microscopy, including live imaging and imaging in human tissue. The limited amount of techniques which can be used to image lung regeneration at high spatiotemporal resolution was reiterated throughout the workshop. Current techniques are limited by difficulties in penetrating thick tissue samples, long imaging acquisition times and phototoxicity. Basic Science: Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells and Disease Modelling · Refine and functionally validate protocols to specify lung cells from pluripotent stem cells (iPSC and ESC). Critical comparisons to primary lung cells. · Continue to develop disease-specific populations of ESC-/iPSC-derived cells, to study rare lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis and 1-antitrypsin deficiency. · Continue to development of high-throughput cellular models from pluripotent sources for screening of novel therapeutics. · Comprehensively evaluate the effect of environmental influences, including mechanical forces, extracellular matrix, inflammation and infection on development of lung tissue from stem and progenitor cells. Basic Science: Understanding of the Impact of Stem Cell: Niche Interactions · Continue to elucidate how endogenous lung stem/progenitor cells are regulated in normal development and during tissue homeostasis. · Analysis of epigenetic modulation of lung stem cells and how cellular microenvironments change this. · Understand how autologous iPSC-derived lung lineages will behave in the diseased microenvironment in vivo. Basic Science: Bioengineering and the Lung · Continue to explore lung tissue bioengineering approaches such as artificial matrices, 3D culture systems (e.g. extracellular matrix environments for organoid culture), 3D bioprinting and other novel approaches for generating lung ex vivo and in vivo from stem cells, including systems that facilitate vascular development. · Evaluate effect of environmental influences, including oxygen tension and mechanical forces, including stretch and compression pressure, on development of lung tissue from stem and progenitor cells. · Define the consensus end-points for functional evaluation and validation of engineered lung tissue. · Continue to improve technology to visualise lung regeneration utilising 3D matrices and PCLSs. Translational Science: Cell Therapy - Delivery of Stem Cells to the Lung · Invest in developing larger animal models, such as the ferret and the pig, which have lung structure and function more akin to that of humans, as pre-clinical models to evaluate cellular therapy.

entire mouse lungs ex vivo [94]. Establishment of techniques for light-sheet microscopy, including live imaging and imaging in human tissue, will be important for future studies in lung regeneration.
Setting priorities and recommendations regarding funding future research
The broad field of lung regenerative medicine continues to evolve at an accelerating pace. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), nonprofit respiratory disease foundations and other sources of scientific and funding support remain positive and this will be important for continued development. As in past conference reports, series of scientific and funding recommendations coming out of discussions at the conference and post-conference surveys are presented in table 1. This continues to evolve and reflect a growing interest in application of bioengineering approaches and technologies to the study of lung biology and diseases, something highly evident at the 2019 conference. In the final session, we conducted a series of survey questions addressing key theme areas of the conference; advances in biotechnology and

bioengineering, endogenous lung progenitor cells, cell-based therapies and commercialisation. An audience response system using individual voting remotes was utilised for immediate anonymous responses from participants of the conference (supplemental table 1) to guide discussion and crafting of the overall recommendations
In brief, the survey indicated large and increasing numbers of individuals and research groups utilising technologies such as scRNA-seq and PCLS as well as keen interest in other cutting-edge technologies such as VR (figure 2a). Overall, 30% of respondents indicated a need for more bioengineering programs, whereas 13% felt that the current number is sufficient (figure 2b). 94% of survey responses indicate active, planned, or desired activities in cell-based therapies with the majority indicating interest/activity in endogenous progenitor cells (34%). However, robust and similar interest in MSCs, iPSCs and EVs highlighted the support for a broad range of approaches (figure 2c). Importantly, there was strong uniform sentiment that these areas are underfunded with a strong call (94%) for all funding agencies to increase support for cell-based therapies. With respect to commercialisation, 36% of respondents indicated either a commercialised product or one in development with 87% indicating adequate support for commercialisation through technology transfer offices or other avenues at their respective institution (figure 2d). Only a small number (9%) indicated that they required assistance in developing commercialisation strategies. Overall, 72% of respondents indicated that all funding agencies must increase support for commercialisation pathways. The vast majority of participants indicating plans to participate in the next conference in 2021.
Conclusions Since the last conference in 2017, substantial advances in the development of new technologies, increasing utilisation of scRNA-seq data, and the further development of more physiologically relevant 3D cellular models have driven considerable progress in the field moving closer to the development of potential therapeutic strategies for lung repair after injury or in end-stage lung disease. Despite the progress, there are still considerable deficits in our understanding of how transcriptomic changes in different endogenous and derived stem and progenitor cell populations correlate to function at the tissue and organ level, how to describe the stem cell niche and how changes in this niche lead to functional alterations in the these cells. The pursuit of understanding the function of human lung across the spectrum from a subcellular to organ level to improve success of therapeutic translation of our findings will be increasingly dependent on

collaborative and interdisciplinary research teams. This includes further synthesis and integration of
technologic advances highlighted in this conference and elsewhere. This conference continues to bring
together leaders across such multidisciplinary areas of active research from basic biologists, bioengineers
and bioinformaticians to ethicists, business leaders and policy makers and retains a focus on the
promotion of innovation among junior scientists across the world. The recommendations in table 1
compiled from active discussion throughout the conference should provide a platform for stimulating
active new research that will progress the field toward its goals for restoration of a functional lung in
patients living with acute and chronic lung disease. Each of these recommendations is worthy of intensive
and extensive further development and review beyond the scope of this summary.

ABSTRACT
Background and study aims The repair costs of gastrointestinal endoscopes account for a significant proportion of the total budget of an endoscopy unit. This study evaluated the repair costs of small-caliber endoscopes and conventional endoscopes used in esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Patients and methods A retrospective analysis of upper gastrointestinal endoscope damage and repair costs between April 2012 and May 2019 was performed at the Toyoshima Endoscopy Clinic. Conventional endoscopes (GIF-H260, GIF-HQ290, and GIF-H290Z) were used for transoral EGD while small-caliber endoscopes (GIF-XP260N and GIF-XP290N) were used for transnasal or transoral EGD. Results Three small-caliber endoscopes and five conventional endoscopes were used for 1,031 procedures and 31,192 procedures, respectively. The number of procedures/damage incidence for small-caliber endoscope and conventional endoscopes was 344 and 1950, respectively. Damage incidence for small-caliber endoscopes was significantly higher than for conventional endoscopes (P = 0.014). Repair costs/procedure were $ 5.95 ± $132 for small-caliber endoscopes and $2.41 ± $115 for conventional endoscopes. Repair costs/procedure for small-caliber endoscopes were more than twice those for conventional endoscopes. Conclusions Small-caliber endoscopes are more fragile than conventional endoscopes.

Introduction
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is the routine method for investigating the upper digestive system [1-3]. Small-caliber gastrointestinal endoscopes have been developed and marketed and can be inserted transnasally [4, 5]. Transnasal endoscopy is better tolerated, with high levels of patient comfort and acceptability and can be safely performed [6, 7]. However, there are several problems with small-caliber endoscopes. They have technical difficulties due to greater flexibility but limited optical capabilities. Video image resolution is inferior to con-

ventional high-resolution endoscopes. Furthermore, image quality may be impaired when secretions or bubbles are present, as a result of poorer suction and lavage [8].
On the other hand, repair costs and maintenance of gastrointestinal endoscopy equipment represent an important share of the total budget of the endoscopy unit. Gastrointestinal endoscopes are damaged through routine wear and tear during procedures, as well as use of aggressive cleaning and disinfection processes [9]. However, repair costs of small-caliber versus conventional endoscopes have never been evaluated. This

study evaluated repair costs of small-caliber and conventional endoscopes in EGD.
Patients and methods
A retrospective analysis of upper gastrointestinal endoscope damage and repair costs between April 2012 and May 2019 was performed at Toyoshima Endoscopy Clinic, an outpatient clinic specializingd in endoscopy. This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the Hattori Clinic [10]. All clinical investigations were conducted according to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.
At the time of analysis, the following upper gastrointestinal endoscopes were in use: Olympus GIF-H260, GIF-XP260N, GIFHQ290, GIF-H290Z, and GIF-XP290N. Data on repair costs were obtained from the archive of the invoices of gastrointestinal endoscope repairs and were then compared to the invoice copies from the service company (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Endoscopic examination
EGD was used to evaluate patients with abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding and iron-deficiency anemia, and those who had undergone screening for cancer, polyps, atrophic gastritis, and physical check-up. EGD was performed for diagnostic (observation and biopsies), not for therapeutic purposes, such as polypectomy. Conventional endoscopes (GIF-H260, GIFHQ290, and GIF-H290Z) were used for transoral EGD. Before starting , the pharynx of patients was topically anesthetized by gargling with 2 % lidocaine hydrochloride viscous solution (Xylocaine Viscous 2 %, AstraZeneca Inc., Japan) [11]. Sedation with midazolam and/or pethidine was induced based on the patient's willingness [12, 13]. Small-caliber endoscopes (GIFXP260N and GIF-XP290N) were used for transnasal EGD or transoral EGD. The nasal cavity was prepared by spraying three puffs of 0.05 % naphazoline (Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd., Kyoto,

Japan), followed by 1 mL of 4 % Xylocaine delivered as a fine mist using a mucosal atomization device. Furthermore, 3 mL of Xylocaine Viscous was injected into the nasal cavity. An endoscopic nurse assisted with every procedure. Use of small-caliber endoscopes was based on patient preference and better patient tolerability.
Cleaning and disinfection of endoscopes
High-level disinfection was achieved with an automated endoscope re-processor following manufacturer's instructions with strong acidic electrolyzed water (Kaigen pharma CO., LTD. Osaka, Japan). Both small-caliber and conventional endoscopes were sterilized using an automated endoscope re-processor. All endoscopes were stored in endoscope storage cabinets.
Statistical analysis
We compared incidence of damage and repair costs between small-caliber and conventional endoscopes with use of a Student's t-test or Welch's t-test or -squared test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed using the Stat Mate IV software (ATOMS, Tokyo, Japan).
Results
During the study period, 32,223 EGD procedures were performed. Characteristics of small-caliber and conventional endoscope groups are shown in  Table 1. Three small-caliber endoscopes and five conventional endoscopes were used for 1,031 procedures and 31,192 procedures, respectively. Duration of use for small-caliber and conventional endoscopes was 86 ± 61.5 months and 75.8 ± 42.7 months, respectively. The number of procedures/damage incidence for small-caliber endoscopes and conventional endoscopes was 344 and 1950, respectively. Damage incidence for small-caliber endoscopes was significantly higher than that for conventional endoscopes

(P = 0.014). Repair costs/procedure for the small-caliber and conventional endoscopes were $ 5.95 ± $ 132 and $ 2.41 ± $ 115, respectively. Repair costs/procedure for the small-caliber endoscopes were more than twice those for the conventional endoscope (P = 0.396).
Types of endoscope damage are shown in  Table 2. The most frequent type of damage was to the rubber coat on the distal bending section.
Discussion
Small-caliber endoscopes had a higher frequency of repair than conventional endoscopes. Repair costs for small-caliber endoscopes could be twice that of conventional endoscopes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about repair costs for small-caliber gastrointestinal endoscopes. Fragility and higher repair costs might have an impact on the management strategy of an endoscopy unit, such as the decision about purchase of small-caliber versus conventional endoscopes.
Repair costs/procedures for small-caliber and conventional endoscopes were $ 5.95 ± $ 132 and $ 2.41 ± $ 115, respectively. Repair costs for gastrointestinal endoscopes account for a significant proportion of the total budget of an endoscopy unit. The doctors and staff who handle endoscopes should recognize the expensive repair costs and avoid rough handling.
Damage to the rubber coat on the distal bending section was the most frequent type of damage. Extreme bending during endoscopic procedures puts the distal bending section under great mechanical stress, predisposing it to wear and tear [14]. Wear and tear damages occur not only during procedures but also during cleaning and maintenance. Because small-caliber endoscopes are thin, they break easily.
This study had some limitations. First, it was a retrospective review at a single institution. Second, patients were not randomized to either the thin endoscope group or conventional endoscope group; thus, there were background differences.

Conclusion
In conclusion, small-caliber endoscopes are more fragile than conventional endoscopes.

Abstract Background: Few measures capture the complex symptoms and concerns of those receiving palliative care. Aim: To validate the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale, a measure underpinned by extensive psychometric development, by evaluating its validity, reliability and responsiveness to change. Design: Concurrent, cross-cultural validation study of the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale - both (1) patient self-report and (2) staff proxy-report versions. We tested construct validity (factor analysis, known-group comparisons, and correlational analysis), reliability (internal consistency, agreement, and test-retest reliability), and responsiveness (through longitudinal evaluation of change). Setting/participants: In all, 376 adults receiving palliative care, and 161 clinicians, from a range of settings in the United Kingdom and Germany Results: We confirm a three-factor structure (Physical Symptoms, Emotional Symptoms and Communication/Practical Issues). Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale shows strong ability to distinguish between clinically relevant groups; total Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale and Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale subscale scores were higher - reflecting more problems - in those patients with `unstable' or `deteriorating' versus `stable' Phase of Illness (F=15.1, p<0.001). Good convergent and discriminant validity to hypothesised items and subscales of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General is demonstrated. The Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale shows good internal consistency (=0.77) and acceptable to good test-retest reliability (60% of items kw>0.60). Longitudinal validity in form of responsiveness to change is good. Conclusion: The Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale is a valid and reliable outcome measure, both in patient self-report and staff proxy-report versions. It can assess and monitor symptoms and concerns in advanced illness, determine the impact of healthcare interventions, and demonstrate quality of care. This represents a major step forward internationally for palliative care outcome measurement.

What is already known about the topic?
·· Validated measures of symptoms and quality-of-life already exist for palliative care. ·· Symptom measures do not capture broader concerns of those with advanced illness, such as information needs, family,
practical issues, and so on. ·· Quality-of-life measures are often weighted towards symptoms and function, and may be less relevant and applicable in
far-advanced illness. ·· Few existing measures have a validated proxy-report version.
What this paper adds?
·· The Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale (IPOS) is shown to be clinically meaningful, with good validity, reliability, and responsiveness to change.
·· Both patient self-report and staff proxy-report versions of IPOS are evaluated, allowing maximum flexibility for clinical use.
Implications for practice
·· IPOS is a comprehensive and psychometrically robust measure underpinned by what patients report as their main concerns, and brief enough to be used in advanced illness.
·· This is a major advance for palliative care outcome measurement internationally.

Background
Healthcare systems around the world face major challenges because of increasing numbers of older people with multi-morbidities, and growing need for palliative care.1 The increase in chronic diseases - now accounting for a third of all deaths globally - as well as population ageing, is responsible for these changes.2,3 More people need palliative care,3 with some estimates exceeding 40 million/year worldwide.1
To meet current challenges, unexplained variations in healthcare quality need to be addressed through improving outcomes.4 This can only be achieved with measurement of individual patient-centred outcomes.5 Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are validated questionnaires completed by patients to measure their perceptions of their own health status/wellbeing.6 Available PROMs tend to be illness-specific,7-10 rather than capturing common concerns in advanced illness, regardless of diagnosis. Most PROMs focus on disease control or complications,11 rather than the concerns of patients.
One of the few outcome measures which does capture the full range of concerns prioritised by those with advanced illness themselves, is the Palliative care Outcome Scale (POS).12 POS was developed >15 years ago, has been psychometrically well tested,13-16 and is widely used.17-19 It is a brief, person-centred outcome measure,20 yet incorporates the main concerns that people with advanced illness themselves prioritise.21
Although evidence from POS users demonstrated its value in practice and research, there was need for a more refined version (e.g. incorporating more symptoms, refining the spiritual/existential item for diverse populations)

to aid utility.22,23 Having cognitively tested a refined version of POS, the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale (IPOS),24 we therefore aimed to evaluate the validity, reliability, and responsiveness to change of the patient selfreport and staff proxy-report IPOS. IPOS covers patients' main concerns, common symptoms, patient/family distress, existential well-being, sharing feelings with family or friends, information received, and practical concerns, within a timeframe of 3 days (for inpatient settings) or 7 days (for ambulatory settings).
Methods
We are following established quality criteria25 to refine and validate IPOS. The first steps, involving cognitive testing, are published;24 this involved cultural adaption and cognitive interviewing in both English and German,24 to establish a final IPOS in both languages (available for download at www.pos-pal.org). Here, we report testing of the construct validity, reliability, and responsiveness of this final version of IPOS, in both languages. The design is a multi-centre validation study of two versions of IPOS - (a) patient self-report and (b) staff proxy-report.
Population and settings
Patients receiving palliative care were consecutively recruited from eight UK and five German sites: (a) three UK and one German hospital consultation services, (b) five UK and three German in-patient palliative units, and (c) seven UK and two German community (home-based) palliative services. Staff caring for participating patients were also recruited. Data were gathered between June 2014 and January 2016.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria for patient participants were: >18 years of age, capacity for written informed consent (as judged by the clinical team), and able to speak/read English or German. Exclusion criteria for patient participants were as follows: impaired capacity, too unwell or distressed to participate (as judged by their clinical teams); or unable to understand English or German. Inclusion criterion for staff participants was delivering care for a patient participant. Staff participants scored the research measures independently of the corresponding patient participant.
Data collection
Demographic/clinical information for patient participants at baseline included age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, if living alone, presence/absence of family caregiver(s), performance status using Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance Status (AKPS),26 and primary diagnosis.
Data (see Table 1 for data collection measures) were collected at two time-points; 2-5days apart within inpatient settings, and 7-21days apart in community settings. For patient participants, IPOS (patient version, 3-day recall period), Edmonton Symptom Assessment System-revised (ESASr)30-32 and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G)33 were collected at first time-point, and IPOS (patient-version) and global change question (see Table 1)34,40 were collected at the second time-point. For staff participants, the staff-version of IPOS, the Support Team Assessment Schedule (STAS),41 AKPS26 and Phase of Illness38 were collected at the first time point, and IPOS (staff-version), AKPS, and Phase of Illness were collected at the second time point.
Analysis
All data were independently double-entered and crosschecked. If not otherwise stated, missing data were excluded pairwise for all analyses.
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample, and the range/distribution of scores for individual IPOS items, IPOS subscales (as derived from the factor analysis), and total scores.
Construct validity (a) Structural validity: We undertook confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to establish structural validity and subscales. Taking prior factor analyses into account,15,16 we contrasted a 2-factor with a 3-factor solution. We used robust maximum likelihood estimation to accommodate the ordinal nature of the data.42 Fit of each solution was evaluated using chi-square, ratio of chi-square and degrees of freedom, confirmatory fit index, Tucker-Lewis index

and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA).43 Contrasting models were compared regarding fit indices, standardized parameter estimates, and local strains (low loadings, high standard error).44 (b) Known-group comparisons: We hypothesized from prior evidence38 that
·· Those with `unstable' or `deteriorating' Phase of Illness would have (i) a higher total IPOS score (more symptoms/concerns) and (ii) higher physical symptom scores on IPOS, than those with `stable' Phase of Illness.
·· Those with lower function (AKPS) would have (iii) higher total IPOS scores and (iv) higher physical symptom scores on IPOS.45
Non-parametric tests after checking of assumptions were used, Kruskal-Wallis H test for hypotheses (i) and (ii), and Mann-Whitney U test for (iii) and (iv).
(c) Convergent and discriminant validity was tested by correlating individual IPOS items and subscales with respective items and subscales from patientreported ESAS-r32 and FACT-G33 measures, using Spearman's correlation coefficients with associated p-values. We hypothesized:
·· High correlations (r>0.70) of identical or nearidentical single items relating to the physical/psychological symptoms from ESAS and IPOS.
·· Mid-range correlations (r 0.50.7) between (i) total ESAS scores (which includes only symptoms) and (ii) FACT-G total/subscale scores (not covering spiritual, practical and family issues as in IPOS), with total IPOS scores (including domains beyond symptoms).
Reliability (a) Internal consistency was estimated using Cronbach's  for IPOS total scores and subscales. The normally accepted threshold for good internal consistency of 0.825,46 was lowered to 0.6 due to the multi-dimensional, non-redundant nature of the IPOS.47 (b) Test-retest reliability was determined among those patients reporting no change on the global change rating.34 (c) Inter-rater reliability was assessed between independent patient and staff ratings, and between two independent staff ratings. Cohen's weighted kappa (w) was calculated as the reliability statistic, together with proportion agreement of cases where staff or patient's ratings were equal to or within +1 or -1 of the score, and Spearman correlation to test the association between patient/

Details of measure
IPOS combines the items from the Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS) and those from its symptom list (POS and POS-S) into one integrated measure. There are two versions of IPOS: patient self-report and staff proxy-report. The IPOS versions consist of 20 (patient version) or 19 (staff version) items: one free-text question about main problems and concerns, 17 items on physical, psychological, spiritual problems, communication needs including with family, and practical support. They are scores on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 0 (best) to 4 (worst). One additional free-text items asks about additional symptoms to be specified and scored. In the patient version, there is also an additional item reporting by whom the measure was completed (patient alone, with family help, with staff help). Only the 17 standardised items contribute to the IPOS total score. The full IPOS measure is available for download at www.pos-pal.org.
ESAS consists of nine visual analogue scales, scored from 0-10, including pain, shortness of breath, nausea, depression, activity, anxiety, well-being, drowsiness and appetite. Initially, ESAS was developed to measure the most common symptoms in cancer patients. Higher scores indicate worse symptoms.
FACT-G comprises 27 items, divided into four primary quality of life domains: Physical well-being (7 items), Social/family wellbeing (7 items), Emotional well-being (6 items), and Functional well-being (7 items). Each item is measured on a 5-point Likerttype scale. Higher scores indicate better functioning.
Single-item asking patient participants to report overall change in their symptoms and concerns; `Over the last three days would you say that things have got better/worse /there has been no change'.
STAS represents the first available staff-rated palliative care clinical assessment, comprising 9 core and up to 20 optional items covering physical, psychosocial, spiritual, communication, planning, family concerns and service aspects. We used the supplementary definitions and ratings for individual symptoms as described in Clinical Audit in Palliative Care.35
Single item staff-reported measure to provide the context of the current phase of illness with four categories; stable, unstable, deteriorating, and terminal. This single item measure is recorded by staff.
A single score between 0% and 100% (in 10% steps) based on a patient's ability to perform common tasks relating to activity, work and self-care. A score of 100% signifies normal physical abilities with no evidence of disease. Decreasing numbers indicate reduced performance status.

Background, validation and references The original Palliative care Outcome Scale (POS) included 10 items covering domains most important to patients with advanced illness.12 Following patient and staff feedback, a symptom module (POS-S, adapted for specific conditions) was added. Staff versions of POS and POS-S were also developed.27 Both patient- and staff-reported versions of POS and POS-S have undergone extensive psychometric testing. Both measures show good validity and internal consistency12,20 as well as test-retest reliability12 in diverse settings.13-20 Factor analysis suggests two subscales, psychological well-being and quality of care.15 It has been translated, culturally adapted and validated for use in fourteen languages16,17,28,29 and is widely used internationally.18,19,23 Phase 1 of this IPOS validation study included cognitive interviewing to assess acceptability and content/face validity, and identify cognitive processing issues; this has been reported previously.24
The revised ESAS has been widely validated for use in assessing the symptoms of patients with advanced progressive illness.30-32
Initially developed as a quality-of-life measure for evaluating patients receiving cancer treatment, it has been widely validated across long-term conditions.33
A single global `change' question recommended for assessing responsiveness of patient-reported outcome measures.34
It is a validated tool designed to allow clinical staff to assess the clinical and intermediate outcomes of palliative care.36,37
Phase of illness categorises seriously ill patients according to the acuteness and urgency of palliative needs, and has been used as a predictor of resource use for Australian sub-acute and non-acute healthcare.38 It shows good inter-rater reliability and clinical utility in populations with advanced progressive illness.38,39 The Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance Status (AKPS) is based on the Karnofsky Performance Status, but is adapted for advanced illness.26

staff or two independent staff ratings. For interpretation, the Landis and Koch48 and Fleiss'49 criteria of k > 0.4 for fair to good and k > 0.75 for substantial to excellent agreement were used.
Responsiveness to change.We assessed responsiveness using a distribution-based approach.50 We compared mean changes and respective standard deviations of change descriptively in the six categories of change given by the global change rating (ranging from much better to much worse with a `don't know'-category).
All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 24.0.51 The R lavaan package (version),52 was used for CFA. A p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.
Sample size.Sample size considerations were based on guidelines for sample sizes for factor analysis53 and a Monte Carlo study, determining the sample size to detect factor loadings of at least 0.40 (based on former factor analytic evidence from the POS),15,16 a power of 80% and an alpha level of 0.05. Simulations were run using the R simsem package,54 using 10,000 replications and assuming missing data to be handled within a full information maximum likelihood approach. A sample size of 320 was deemed sufficient for modelling.
Results
Subject characteristics
In all, 392 patient participants were recruited. Screened, eligible, approached and consented participants, and first (n=376) and second (n=275) timepoint completion, with reasons for non-completion, are shown in Appendix Figure 1. Demographic and clinical characteristics are reported in Table 2.
Descriptive statistics and distribution
Table 3 shows prevalence for IPOS items, distribution of IPOS scores, and % of missing data, at first timepoint. The full range of response options was used; only the items `Vomiting', `Having enough information' and `Practical matters' showed positive skew above ±1.0. There was little missing data; the highest percentage of missing data was for `Poor appetite' (3.5%), `Family anxiety' (2.4%), `Vomiting' (2.1%), `Practical matters' (2.1%), 'Having enough information' (1.9%), and `Feeling at peace' (1.9%).
Structural validity, identification of subscales, and internal consistency
An initial CFA was conducted to test for uni-dimensionality, a model using all 17 scorable IPOS items loading onto one

latent variable. As expected for IPOS (a multi-dimensional measure), the goodness-of-fit indices of this initial CFA suggest no adequate fit, with fit indices comparative fit index (CFI) (0.55) and RMSEA (0.11) well below and above the recommended cut-offs (see Appendix Table 1). The threefactor solution showed a better fit than the two-factor solution (see standardised factor loadings in Appendix Table 2). The first factor, Physical Symptoms, comprises 10 items and explains 24.9% of variance. The second factor, Emotional Symptoms, consists of 4 items and explains 12.3% of variance. The third factor, Communication/Practical Issues, contains 3 items, and explains 8.3% of variance. (These three factors we use throughout the analysis as subscales; the Physical, Emotional, and Communication/Practical subscales.) Total and subscale statistics are shown in Table 4. Cronbach's  was 0.77, showing good internal consistency for the total scale. For the IPOS subscales, Cronbach's  was 0.70, 0.68, and 0.58, respectively.

Construct validity
One-way analysis of variance supported our prior hypothesis that total IPOS scores and IPOS subscale scores were higher in those patients with unstable or deteriorating Phase of Illness compared to stable Phase of Illness (F=15.1, p<0.001 for total IPOS and F=17.8 and 5.7, p<0.003 for IPOS Physical and IPOS Emotional symptoms, respectively) (see Appendix Figure 2).
The total IPOS (t=2.8, p=0.006), IPOS Physical Symptoms subscale (t=3.8, p<0.001), and individual IPOS items `Shortness of breath', `Weakness or lack of energy', `Drowsiness', `Poor mobility', `Family anxiety', `Depression' and `Information' were all able to distinguish between those patients with higher versus lower functional status on Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance Status (60%- 100% vs 0%-50%) (see Appendix Table 5). Because of skewed data, these comparisons were also run using equivalent non-parametric tests, with highly similar results.
Convergent and discriminant validity assessment also comprised testing a series of hypotheses for how IPOS subscales and single items correlate with single items, subscales and total scores of ESAS and FACT-G. Correlations were confirmed, being in the hypothesised range of magnitude and direction (see Appendix Tables 3 and 4).
Reliability
In all, 66 patients self-classified as stable between the two timepoints. This was confirmed using the staff-reported `Phase of Illness'. For these 66 stable patients, test-retest reliability weighted kappa values showed good to very good agreement (range 0.50-0.8), except for the items `Sharing feelings with family or friends' (=0.20), `Having enough information' (=0.39), `Feeling at peace' (=0.43), and `Drowsiness' (=0.43). The proportion agreement within one score between assessments was generally good to excellent with these four items being the only ones with proportions below 80% (see Table 5). Note that Cohen's weighted kappa was calculated using all answer options, and for each item of the IPOS, plus all subscale and total scores of the IPOS.
For the assessment of inter-rater agreement between two independent staff, a maximum of 95 matched pairs per IPOS item was available. Agreement as measured by weighted Kappa scores was good (=0.4) for 11 of 17 IPOS items with the highest levels of agreement being achieved for the items `Pain' (=0.72), `Shortness of breath' (=0.82) and `Nausea' (=0.63). Lower levels of agreement were observed for items `Weakness or lack of energy', `Drowsiness', `Family anxiety', `Sharing feelings with family or friends', `Has the patient had enough information as s/he wanted?' and `Have any practical matters resulting from his or her illness been addressed?'.

of the standard error of measurement for these items with low levels of agreement showed that errors for these items were close to 1 point on the IPOS.
The comparison of staff and patient ratings yielded similar results with acceptable to good agreement (=0.3) achieved on 11 of 17 IPOS items with highest levels of agreement for `Pain', `Shortness of breath', `Vomiting', and `Constipation'. Again, items `Having had enough information' (=0.02), `Have practical matters been addressed?' (=0.10), and `Sharing feelings with family or friends' (=0.13) showed low levels of agreement, together with the items `Drowsiness' (=0.11), `Feeling at peace' (=0.26) and `Sore or dry mouth (=0.25) (see Table 3). However, the proportion of scores that were within one score of a perfect match was still

high (above 70%) for these items, except for `Drowsiness' (60.6%) and `Sore or dry mouth' (65.1%). The proportion with agreement between patient and staff ratings was higher at the second assessment (see Appendix, Table 7).
Responsiveness
Table 6 presents the mean changes in the IPOS total score in relation to patients' global report of change. SD at baseline for the total IPOS score was 9.2. Mean change scores for the total score were as large as 4.3 in the `much improved' group and even larger (-9.6) for the group that described themselves as `much worse'. However, associated standard deviations of change were comparably large, pointing towards potential misclassification

IPOS: Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale.

according to the global change criterion. Overall, a change of about 5 points in the total IPOS score represents a moderate effect size.

Discussion
IPOS is a valid and reliable outcome measure for use with people with advanced illness. It has good structural validity, with three underlying factors - physical symptoms, emotional symptoms, and communication/practical issues. Unusually, this validation study included a high proportion of people with poor functional status, strengthening conclusions for the advanced illness population.

IPOS discriminates clearly between different palliative Phases of Illness.38,39 The physical symptom subscale also discriminates between those with poor or high functional status. Almost all individual IPOS items show good agreement when re-tested in stable patients. There is acceptable or good agreement between most patient self-reported and staff proxy-reported items. Most importantly, the total IPOS score showed a change in keeping with patientreport of the overall change in their symptoms and other concerns, both in direction and size of change.
The changing age distribution of the population and increasing prevalence of multi-morbidities (with more complex health needs)55 require outcome measures to work across conditions and in advanced illness.56 Only measures that reflect patient priorities can support a truly patient-centred approach to care.57 Until now, outcome measures extending beyond symptoms or quality-of-life for this population have been lacking. Health-related qualityof-life measures, often heavily based on physical function, show low sensitivity with large floor/ceiling effects among those with advanced, multi-morbid disease and do not capture the main priorities of those affected.58-64
The IPOS has features which set it apart from other outcome measures commonly used in the context of advanced disease. Including how symptoms or other concerns have affected the individual themselves is a distinct characteristic not commonly sought in quality-of-life or symptom

tools.65 The ESAS,31 the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI),66 the Symptom Distress Scale67 and the Palliative Problem Severity Score (PCPSS)38 all focus on severity of symptoms. With the exception of PCPSS, they score physical and psychological symptoms, excluding concerns such as family issues (family anxiety, sharing feelings with family or friends), spirituality, practical issues, information needs, and communication concerns.58-64
While existing tools are well-validated,41,67-71 proxyreported versions are much less well established.72,73 IPOS may also capture the impact of symptoms and concerns differently. In terms of overall validity, the performance of the new, refined IPOS is comparable to both the original POS and similar measures in the field. In the original POS validation,12 mid-range correlations to the EORTC QLQ-C30 physical, non-physical and quality-of-life subscales were reported. Mid-range correlations were also apparent in comparison of POS with the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist,74 the Italian POS with the FACIT-SP and EORTC QLQ-C15-Pal,55 the POS-S with the Rotterdam checklist, the MDASI and EORTC measures,12,55,74 and in this validation study when comparing IPOS to FACT-G and ESAS. This result - of mid-range rather than high correlations - is likely because existing scales largely focus on the severity of symptoms, whereas POS and IPOS focus on how a person is affected. In line with this, comparison of the POS pain item with the Brief Pain Inventory's pain impairment item yielded a higher correlation than to the Pain Severity item.74 The mid-range correlations (0.50) between aspects of psychological well-being across questionnaires further demonstrate the different dimensions included in IPOS, covering wider issues of spiritual and family well-being. The consistently low correlations of the communication/practical items with other outcome measures across studies point towards the uniqueness of this aspect.12,55,74,75
The second distinct feature of this validation of IPOS is the broader testing of reliability. In terms of test-retest reliability, we found mostly good to very good agreement (weighted kappa values 0.50-0.80). These values are higher than in similar studies of test-retest reliability of either POS12,55,74,75 or ESAS,31,70,76 perhaps explained by using an external criterion to judge stability, rather than assuming stability over 24-48 h, an assumption that might not be justified in a fast-changing palliative population.58 However, some items of IPOS (`Sharing feelings with family or friends', `Having enough information', `Feeling at peace', and `Drowsiness') showed less agreement. These items also showed low agreement in the comparison of patient and staff ratings. This is consistent with prior studies of the biases affecting proxy assessments,77 which suggest systematic overestimation of physical symptoms and underestimation of psychological well-being and information needs.78-81 The low agreement for the information item had also been observed in studies of POS; Higginson and Gao82 reported a weighted kappa value as low as 0.04

for this item, and results by Dawber et al.78 and Van SoestPoortvliet et al.83 are similar. A study of the Palliative care Problem Severity Index38 identified features of the raters (e.g. new staff member with new patient), patient characteristics (e.g. communication problems, drowsiness), or family characteristics (e.g. lacking interaction with family), as impeding agreement. This result has also been observed in a study looking at proxy ratings of the McGill Quality of Life questionnaire.79 These features may also have been present in the IPOS validation study. Fluctuating symptoms, in particular drowsiness, may also contribute to this as demonstrated for the comparable ESAS item.84,85
This validation was cross-cultural, conducted in two countries simultaneously, and we believe this strengthened both cognitive development of the measure24 and this full-scale validation. Despite some skewness in distributions of individual items, both parametric and nonparametric statistics showed highly similar and robust results, both in terms of correlations and test of differences. However, there were limitations in the population studied; only 15% of patient participants had non-cancer conditions. IPOS needs to be further tested in non-cancer conditions, and refinements for different diseases may be required. Indeed, development of a version for use in cognitive impairment and dementia is already well under way.86
The use of consecutive enrolment ensured IPOS was validated in a broadly clinically representative group. However, selection bias cannot be ruled out. This validation also mirrored conditions for IPOS use in clinical practice - the `least controlled' use - for instance with absence of specific staff training prior to implementation.87
Despite incorporation of a global criterion for change, it was not possible to derive values for a minimal clinically important change for improvement or deterioration for the total IPOS, its subscales, and individual items. Such a feature is desirable, as optimal cut-offs for individual symptoms in particular can trigger specific clinical actions, such as referral to a palliative care team, help triage patients within services88 and therefore extend the clinical and research utility of an outcome measure.72,89,90
Clinical and research implications
This study has demonstrated IPOS is valid and reliable. Because it is brief and underpinned by the symptoms and concerns of people with advanced illness, it will be invaluable for clinical practice and research. To implement such a measure into routine clinical practice needs training. A recent survey of the use of ESAS showed a range of training needs and other barriers.85 We are already working on best ways to implement, using the national Outcomes Assessment and Complexity Collaborative in the United Kingdom. This is based on the well-established Australian Palliative Care Outcomes Collaborative.91

Conclusion
The IPOS is a valid and reliable outcome measure for use with people with advanced illness, both in its patient selfreport and staff proxy-report versions. It is suitable for assessing and monitoring symptoms and concerns in advanced illness, monitoring change over time, determining the impact of healthcare interventions, and demonstrating quality of care. This will be invaluable for clinical care, audit and research, and represents a major step forward internationally for outcome measurement in advanced illness.

Associations of Renal Vascular Resistance With Albuminuria and Other Macroangiopathy in Type 2
Diabetic Patients

OBJECTIVE -- Albuminuria can be caused by endothelial dysfunction as a result of ischemic nephropathy rather than classic diabetic nephropathy. We studied whether renal vascular resistance (resistive index [RI]) of the main renal arteries could be associated with albuminuria and further assessed the relationship between RI and aorta stiffness measured by brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity (baPWV).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We consecutively studied 150 patients with type 2 diabetes and the absence of clinically overt renal artery stenosis. Renal function expressed as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the modified formula of modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD). The RI [(peak systolic velocity - end-diastolic velocity)/peak systolic velocity] was measured with duplex Doppler ultrasonography.
RESULTS -- When the presence of albuminuria (uAlb) was defined as urinary albumin-tocreatinine ratio (g/mg  creatinine) 30, mean RI [(left RI  right RI)/2] was significantly higher in uAlb, compared with that in patients without uAlb. RI had significant associations with age (r  0.398, P  0.0001), diastolic blood pressure (r  0.398, P  0.0001), eGFR (r  0.373, P  0.0001), and baPWV (r  0.223, P  0.05), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that increased RI when defined as RI 0.72 (median) was significantly associated with age (P  0.01, 95%CI 1.02-1.19), diastolic blood pressure (P  0.01, 0.86 - 0.97), and uAlb (P  0.01, 1.53-15.46), respectively. Moreover, RI was an independent risk factor for uAlb after adjustment of both diastolic blood pressure and eGFR.
CONCLUSIONS -- Renal vascular resistance was associated with albuminuria and aorta stiffness. Increased RI may imply the presence of any type of underlying renal damage, including ischemic nephropathy.

D uplex Doppler ultrasonography was used to assess intrarenal hemodynamics. The resistive index (RI) calculated from blood flow velocities in vessels reflects renovascular resistance and is known to increase in various disorders (1-5). Moreover, vasoactive agents, such as angiotensin II or ACE inhibitors (6), are known to affect RI. Regarding mechanisms by which RI of intrarenal arterioles increase, we previously reported that arterio-arteriolosclerosis rather than

interstitial fibrosis could play an important role (7). In addition, we reported that there was a direct relationship between RI and arteriolosclerosis in damaged kidneys, and RI at renal biopsy may be useful as one of the prognostic markers for renal outcome (7).
According to the annual report of the Japan Dialysis Treatment Society in 2006, the most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease is diabetes (8). Although diabetic nephropathy has been considered to be a

microvascular complication, histopathological examination of renal biopsies showed not only typical diffuse or nodular lesions, but also arteriosclerotic glomerulosclerosis (9). It has been reported that RI in patients with renal dysfunction (chronic renal failure) secondary to type 2 diabetes were significantly increased compared to the patients with nondiabetic chronic renal failure (10). Furthermore, regardless of the status of microalbuminuria, which has been considered to be a risk factor for diabetic nephropathy and progression of renal insufficiency, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was also reported to be correlated with RI (11). Indeed, there are several reports showing a correlation between RI and renal function (7,11,12). It is therefore conceivable that nonalbuminuric renal insufficiency (13) could be related to other pathogenetic disorders, such as ischemic nephropathy, rather than classic diabetic nephropathy. In this regard, it should be borne in mind that macroangiopathy, not microangiopathy, is likely to affect GFR because systemic atherosclerotic vascular disease adversely affects renal blood perfusion, resulting in a decrease of GFR, even if clinically overt renal artery stenosis is not evident. Ishimura et al. (12) have already reported that RI values are significantly correlated with both femoral and carotid arterial intima-media thickness (IMT) in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy and that intrarenal hemodynamics are affected by decreased GFR, probably through advanced arteriosclerosis. Recently, Ohta et al. (14) reported that increased RI of the main renal arteries is significantly correlated with the severity of systemic atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the intrarenal vascular resistance differs depending on the underlying renal disease and appears to increase to a greater extent in diabetic nephropathy (14). However, the relationship between RI and albuminuria remains unknown, despite albuminuria being a strong predictor of cardiovascular events caused by endothelial dysfunction (15).
Therefore, we assessed the relation-

ship between RI of the main renal arteries and albuminuria. Moreover, we studied the severity of other macroangiopathy evidenced by an increase in aorta stiffness measured by brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity (baPWV), carotid IMT, and ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) in association with RI.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS --We consecutively studied 150 patients with type 2 diabetes attending the diabetes clinics in our hospital between March 2005 and June 2006. The diagnosis of diabetes was based on a previous history of diabetes or fulfillment of World Health Organization criteria (16). Patients with known renal arterial stenosis, or those with malignancy or systemic disorders, were excluded. The study protocol was approved by the Research and Ethics Committee of the Shonan Kamakura General Hospital, and informed consent was obtained.
Blood was drawn in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 12 h. Urinary albumin concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using fresh spot urine and was expressed as milligrams creatinine of urine. Normoalbuminuria was defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30 g/mg in two or more urine samples and no more than one value 30 g/mg. Microalbuminuria was defined as urinary albuminto-creatinine ratio 30 -299 g/mg. Macroalbuminuria was defined by albumin-to-creatinine ratio 300 g/mg. The presence of albuminuria (uAlb) was defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (g/mg  Cr) 30. Renal function expressed by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the modified formula of modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) (17):
eGFR(male)(ml/min per 1.73 m2)
 0.741  175  Age0.203
 Cr1.154 [if female: eGFR(male)
 0.742]
Comorbidity was recorded and ischemic heart disease was defined as the presence or any history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Cerebrovascular disease was defined as the presence or any history of cerebral or cellebellar infarction or bleeding or subarachnoidal hemorrhage.

Peripheral arterial disease was defined as the presence or any history of bypass surgery or percutaneous peripheral intervention or limb ischemia as evidenced by symptoms of intermittent claudication, resting pain, or gangrene.
Duplex Doppler ultrasonography All measurements were made after an overnight fast in a supine position and during suspended respiration at the end of inspiration. Images were obtained with a duplex Doppler apparatus (Aloka SSD 2000; Aloka, Tokyo, Japan) with a 5-MHz convex array probe in both real-time/ color-coded Doppler and pulse Doppler modes. The ultrasound probe was positioned gently on the flank in oblique projection, and the kidney was visualized as a longitudinal image. A Doppler beam was placed on the main tract of the renal arteries. RI was calculated by the built-in software as follows: RI  (peak systolic velocity  end-diastolic velocity)/peak systolic velocity.
The use of antihypertensive agents was not suspended before the resistive index measurement. Although the patients were not specifically screened for the presence of undiagnosed renal artery stenosis, we nevertheless measured the size of the nephrogram and blood flow at the hilum of each kidney. None of the patients who were included in the study had a hilar acceleration time 100 cm/s or had evidence of kidney atrophy 8 cm. The average of right RI and left RI with the difference between the two kidneys not 15% was used as a marker of renal artery resistance in each individual.
Measurements were performed by well-trained staff unaware of any information concerning the patients. Regarding reproducibility of measurements, interobserver and intraobserver variances were 4.0 and 5.1%, respectively (7).
Aorta stiffness expressed as baPWV, ABI, and carotid IMT Aortic stiffness can be assessed noninvasively by measurement of baPWV (18). Recently, a new and simple device to measure baPWV has been developed. The device measures baPWV using an oscillometric method (19). In this study, the baPWV was automatically calculated with the use of a Colin Waveform Analyzer (form PWV/ABI; Colin, Komaki, Japan). The instrument records baPWV, blood pressure, electrocardiogram, heart sounds, and ABI simultaneously. Validity, reproducibility, and clinical significance

of noninvasive baPWV measurement have been reported elsewhere (19). ABI was estimated by ankle systolic blood pressure/brachial systolic blood pressure.
According to our previous report (20), both carotid arteries were examined using a 7.5-MHz linear array transducer with high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). The IMT was defined as the distance between the leading edge of the lumen-intima echo of the near wall and the leading edge of the media-adventitia echo. The maximum IMT was recorded in the right and left carotid arteries, respectively. In addition to RI, baPWV, IMT, and ABI were expressed as an average of right and left measurements, respectively.
Statistical analysis All the data are expressed as means  SD. Differences between the two groups were analyzed by an unpaired Student's t test. One-way ANOVA was used for multiple comparisons of more than three groups followed by Scheffe's test. Logistic multiple regression analysis was performed to determine more related variables for RI. Increased RI when defined as RI 0.72 (median) was used for logistic regression analysis. The F value for a candidate's entrance or removal from the discriminate function test was set at 4.0. The level of statistical significance was defined as P  0.05. All the statistical analysis was performed with SAS/Windows (Statview version 5.0).
RESULTS --Basic characteristics of the 150 patients are shown in Table 1. Mean age  SD was 66.1  10.2 years, and A1C was 8.01  1.81%. Serum creatinine and eGFR were 0.94  0.43 mg/dl and 77.6  22.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively. Systolic blood pressure (sBP) and diastolic blood pressure (dBP) were both relatively well controlled (sBP 139  21 mmHg and dBP 79  14 mmHg). Comorbidity and co-current use of drugs are also shown in Table 1. The median of urinary albumin excretion was 22.8 g/mg  Cr. The RI of all patients was 0.720  0.071. The baPWV, IMT, and ABI values were 1,894  519 cm/s, 0.943  0.123 mm, and 1.11  0.12, respectively (Table 1).
RI was significantly higher in patients with macroalbuminuria (0.745  0.077), compared with that in patients with normoalbuminuria (0.707  0.067) (P  0.01), as shown in Fig. 1. Univariate regression analysis showed that RI had sig-

ence of albuminuria was defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30 g/ mg:uAlb) (P  0.01, 1.53-15.46) (Table

independent risk factor for the presence of albuminuria. Therefore, RI is a useful marker for the presence of any type of nephropathy found in type 2 diabetes. When we consider the stages of diabetic nephropathy, it is plausible that there is a stage in which albuminuria and GFR do not always correspond to each other. Recent results regarding the pathophysiology of renal disease in type 2 diabetes have challenged the concept that a decline in renal function in patients with diabetes is always accompanied by increased albuminuria. MacIsaac et al. (11) have suggested that renal insufficiency, without albuminuria, is common in type 2 diabetes.
Increased RI is known to be correlated with renal dysfunction or urinary albumin excretion in hypertensive patients under treatment with ACE inhibitors (6). We showed that RI was correlated with macroalbuminuria. Recently, Nosadini et al. (21) showed that increased renal arterial resistance predicts the course of renal function in type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria. The patients with RI 0.8 showed a significant deterioration in GFR. However, albumin excretion rate was similar in both the patients with RI above or below 0.8 at baseline, although overt proteinuria tended to develop more frequently in patients with RI 0.8. Therefore, the present study may indicate that RI was significantly correlated with albuminuria except in normoalbuminuric patients. Considering the finding that RI was not correlated with proteinuria in patients with idiopathic chronic glomerulonephritis (7), the results of the present study may also suggest the difference in the pathophysiological significance of albuminuria between both groups: those with chronic glomerulonephritis and those with diabetes. In diabetic patients, polyvascular disease based

on systemic atherosclerotic disorders could affect renal injury through longterm intrarenal ischemia. Indeed, increased urinary albumin excretion can be a marker of coexisting coronary artery disease in patients with peripheral arterial disease (22). Atherosclerosis affects different vascular systems resulting in polyvascular disease. Recently, the REACH (Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health) study revealed that coronary, cerebral, and peripheral arterial diseases are superimposed on one another (23). In the patients with diabetes, endothelial cells of the renal or intrarenal artery, in addition to glomeruli, would be more affected by atherosclerosis than those in the patients with chronic glomerulonephritis. On the other hand, albuminuria in the patients with chronic glomerulonephritis may be more likely derived from glomerular capillary damage alone without (or with less) damage to the main renal artery. This may be the reason why RI was not correlated with proteinuria in the patients with chronic glomerulonephritis.
Renal injury in diabetic patients includes various pathophysiological disorders. In this regard, we need to be aware of ischemic nephropathy resulting from diminished renal blood perfusion, even if clinically overt renal artery stenosis is absent. Ischemic nephropathy originally refers to the reduction of GFR that is caused by hemodynamically significant renal artery obstruction (24). However, the major clinical questions confronting the nephrologist in considering the diagnosis of ischemic nephropathy include, "Which clinical or laboratory features are most useful in its detection?" The finding that increased RI of renal arteries is significantly correlated with albuminuria would provide a clue to study the clinical prog-

nosis of less severe but long-term ischemic nephropathy. Endothelial cells in glomerular capillary could be easily injured by mechanical stress including ischemia. It has been recently reported that even in proteinuric subjects without diabetes, there is evidence of macrovascular endothelial dysfunction remote from the kidney and of low-grade inflammation that is associated with microvascular endothelial dysfunction (25).
In conclusion, increased RI may imply the presence of any type of underlying renal damage, including ischemic nephropathy resulting in endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.

A GROUP OF PARATYPHOID BACILLI FROM ANIMALS CLOSELY RESEMBLING THOSE FOUND IN MAN.
BY CARL TENBROECK, M.D.
(From tke Department of Animal Patkology of Tke RockefellerInstitute for Medical Research, Princeton, N.Y.)
(Received for publication, March 5, 1920.)
In a previous paper (1) the writer described a group of paratyphoid bacilli, isolated from animals, that with the usual cultural methods seemed to be the same as paratyphoid B, or Bacillus schottmiilleri, as Winslow, Kligler, and Rothberg (2) suggest we call the latter organism. SerologicaUy they could be separated from one another by agglutination absorption tests and to a certain extent by the type of clumps formed in immune sera. Five new cultures belonging to this group have recently been studied and a further effort has been made to differentiate them from the human paratyphoids by a method less complicated than agglutination absorption.
Five of the cultures studied came from swine infected with hogcholera virus, two came from guinea pigs, and one each from a child, a cow, a pigeon, and a mouse. Four cultures of Bacillus schottmiilleri obtained from Dr. C. Krumwiede were used for comparison. The date of isolation and other facts regarding the above cultures are given in the paper already referred to. In addition, cultures isolated by Dr. Smith in 1918 from five calves have been studied and found to belong to the same group, and still more recently additional cultures of this group have been isolated from swine infected with hog-cholera virus. It is evident that these organisms are quite widespread among our domestic animals but just what relation they have to animal diseases will require much further study. In hog-cholera they may tend to emphasize the intestinal lesions, but cases of this disease occur with extensive intestinal changes from which organisms of this group cannot be isolated.

PARATYPHOID BACILLI FROM ANIMALS

Cultural Studies.
Sixteen cultures of the anlmM paratyphoids have been studied culturMty and they have all corresponded to one another and to Bacillus sckottmigleri. The results of the study are given in Table I, which includes the characters of Bacillus enteritidis and of the hog-cholera bacillus.
Some of the strains were tested with inosite with unsatisfactory resuits as the amount of acid produced by the paratyphoids was so small that it seemed possible that it was due to impurities. Other carbohydrates might have been included in the study but they are so

expensive that they would be of no practical value in differentiating the two groups. As shown in the table, no cultural differences have been found between Bacillus enteritidis, Bacillus schottm~lerl, and the animal paratyphoids.
In the hope that a difference might be detected between'animal and human paratyphoids, by a study of the hydrogen ion concentration, cultures were made in dextrose and xylose broth. Both groups gave a hydrogen ion concentration of pH 5.0 in dextrose broth after 4 days incubation, while in xylose broth the pH varied from 5.6 to5.2. Some of the animal strains acted more slowly and others apparently utilized more of the carbohydrate than did the human strains. The difference is so slight, however, that it is of no value in classification.

Serological Studies.
When living cultures are used for immunization of rabbits the sera produced will usually agglutinate both the human and animal paratyphoids to the same titer limit. At times, however, one gets a serum that will agglutinate bacilli of the group used in the immunization in higher dilutions than it does those of the other group. This is apparently due to the individual rabbit rather than the bacteria, for the same culture will act differently in different rabbits.
Cultures from both human and animal sources are agglutinated in only the lower dilutions of sera from animals immune to Bacillus enteritidis and as the results obtained in the present study do not differ from those previously given they need not be repeated here.
When 24 hour bouillon cultures are used as antigens the clumps formed by bacilli of the same group as the immunizing strain are flocculent and after 2 hours incubation form a mass occupying from onequarter to one-half the column of liquid. Bacilli of the other group as a rule give very compact dumps which after standing in the refrigerator over night form a thin film on the bottom of the test-tube. This difference in the clumping is striking but unfortunately it does not always hold true. If growth is more abundant than the average, flocculent clumping may occur where a compact type is expected. The amount of dextrose in the bouillon influences the type of clumps formed. Apparently the amount of growth rather than the change in reaction is responsible for the change. As a rule, however, one can differentiate fairly well between the two groups by the type of clumps, but it can only be regarded as a tentative means of differentiation.
When heated or formalinized bouillon cultures or suspensions in salt solution of the growth from agar slants are used as antigens, agglutination ~vill occur in the same dilutions of serum and the clumps are so nearly alike in character that the two groups cannot be differentiated.
When formalinized bouillon cultures are standardized and agglutinated according to Dreyer's method (3) with the readings made after 2 hours incubation at 50°C. in the water bath and 15 minutes at room temperature, the two groups cannot be differentiated by the degree of agglutination or the type of clumps,

and will not remove those for the animal strains. The calf and swine cultures are identical in this respect as is shown in Tables II and IH.
While the great majority of the agglutination tests was made with sera of animals immunized by the injection of living bouillon cultures, the possibility that sera produced by the injection of heated cultures might differentiate the two groups has also been considered. The serum of an animal immunized by three injections of a suspension of agar slant growth, killed by heating to 50°C. for 1 hour, agglutinated both groups of bacilli to the same degree. When sera of animals immunized by bacilli heated to 70° for 1 hour were tested, it was found that the bacilli of the immunizing group were agglutinated in a somewhat higher dilution than were those of the other group. The difference was not great enough to make it a valuable means of differentiation. Better results might be obtained by using heated and washed bacilli, but this has not been tried.
Since the type of clumping indicates that the difference in these two groups lies in the flagella, antigens were prepared by shaking suspensions of the bacilli for a short time, centrifugalizing, and using the supernatant fluid for precipitation and complement fixation tests. When the antigen belonged to the same group as the immune serum, the precipitate was more flocculent than when it belonged to the other group, but the amount of precipitation was about the same. When such antigens were used for complement fixation, the inhibition of hemolysis was the same with sera of rabbits immune to either group. Formalinized bouillon cultures used as antigens in complement fixation tests were likewise of no value in d~fferentiating the two groups. These results agree with those of the previous paper where extracts of the bacilli were used as antigens.
The results of the serological tests show that the animal paratyphoids which are usually agglutinated to the titer limit in sera of animals immune to Bacillus sc]~ttm~ll~ri can best be separated from the latter by agglutination absorption tests. With the methods commonly used in agglutination tests they would be classed as Bacillus schottm~/~i.

24

PARATYPHOID BACILLI FROM ANIMALS

Cross-Immunization Tests.
In the previous paper it was noted that the injection of living cultures of the swine paratyphoids immunized rabbits to a virulent hogcholera bacillus, whereas rabbits treated in the same way with living cultures of human paratyphoid were not immune. This seemed at that time to indicate that the swine cultures were more closely related to, or possibly were a variety of, the hog-cholera bacillus. These tests have been repeated and the results are given in Table IV.
It will be seen that the calf cultures also immunize rabbits to the hog-cholera bacillus, whereas the human cultures do not. Examination of the records shows that the injection of the animal cultures produces a more severe type of reaction than does the injection of the human cultures. The local lesion is larger and the rise in temperature following a subcutaneous reaction is higher.
Two rabbits were each given a subcutaneous injection of 0.1 ec. of a 24 hour bouillon culture of two strains of human paratyphoid and were chloroformed 1 week later. There was a slight local lesion from which the organisms injected were cultured. The spleen and other organs were normal and cultures from as much as 0.5 cc. of blood, a piece of liver as large as a pea, and stab cultures from the spleen were sterile. Pea-sized bits of spleeal from one rabbit showed no organisms, while from the other there was a growth which proved to be due to the organism injected. 1 week after an intravenous injection of 0.1 cc. of 24 hour bouillon cultures, two other rabbits were chloroformed and their spleens were found to be slightly enlarged. Cultures from the spleen of one of these rabbits showed a growth due to the organism injected, whereas the spleen of the other animal failed to show such organism. The blood, liver, and bile of both rabbits were sterile.
These results show that there is very little growth of the human paratyphoid bacilli in rabbits when they are used in the same amounts that will produce a general invasion by the animal cultures. It therefore seems probable that the immunity to the hog-cholera bacillus produced by the animal paratyphoids is due to the fact that they multiply in the body and increase the resistance enough so that the animals-are able to withstand the hog-cholera bacilli injected, when the amount of the latter used is about ten times the minimal lethal dose.

PARATYPHOID BACILLI FROM ANIMALS

The intimate relation of these organisms is shown by cross-immunization tests made with mice. These animals were immunized at the same time by subcutaneous injections of 0.0001 cc. followed by intraperitoneal injections of 0.005 cc. of 24 hour bouillon cultures. After they had recovered from the latter injection their immunity towards other cultures was tested by intraperitoneal injections of 0.005 cc. of 24 hour bouillon cultures. The results of the test are given in Table V and show that the animal and human cultures immunize against one another and that the calf culture immunized against the swine and vice versa.

DISCUSSION.
The question arises whether we should place these animal paratyphoids, that culturally are the same as Bacillus schottmallerl, in a separate group because they fail to absorb the agglutinins from the serum of animals immune to the latter. This failure to absorb agglutinins seems to be a very fundamental difference and these organisms should be regarded as a distinct variety of paratyphoid. No differences either cultural or serological have been detected between the strains derived from swine, calves, and the few strains from the other species that have been studied.
A common name is desirable for this group of organisms and if it is found, upon further study, that these organisms are the same as the

CARL TENBROECK

27

Aertrycke bacillus, isolated by de Nobele (4) from an outbreak of food poisoning, the name of Bacillus aertryckei would be appropriate. It is possible that there is one host that harbors these organisms and from it the other animals become infected. If this should prove to be the case, a name indicating this host would be the logical one. On the other hand, the naming of the animal from which a particular culture is isolated is desirable and for the present I propose that they be called typhus with a prefix denoting the animal from which they were isolated. The name typhus has only its long use to commend it, as the organisms are n o t like Bacillus ~yphosus, nor do they produce a disease that very closely resembles typhoid fever. Another objection is that in the cultures from the smaller animals the word typhus has been used in connection with the paratyphoid disease that is so common. In my experience most of these cultures from mice and guinea pigs belong to the en~eritidis group and can be separated by their specific agglutination characters, though organisms of the group under consideration also occur. Bacillus enteritidis also occurs in the larger animals. I have found it in one pig, Jensen (5), Meyer, Traum, and Roadhouse (6), and others have found it in calves with diarrhea, and Graham, Reynolds, and Hill (7) have found it in an acute disease of horses. In the future it would be well to call these Bacillus enterilidis and reserve the use of mouse-typhus, guinea pig-typhus, etc., for the organisms that we have considered in this paper.
It is evident that the group that has been considered in this paper has been encountered before. I have already (1) pointed out that many of the strains of so called Bacillus suipestifer probably belong to this group. Bock (8) noted that when he saturated the sera of animals immune to mouse-typhus, Bacillus suipestifer, or bacilli obtained from outbreaks of food poisoning with Bacillus schottm~illeri the agglutinins for the last bacillus were removed while those for the first three organisms were not affected. Sobernheim and Seligmann (9) in studying paratyphoid bacilli noted that three cultures classed as Bacillus sc~ttm~lleri formed fine clumps in the serum of an animalimmune to Bacillus sc~ttmiilleri. They immunized a rabbit to one of these strains heated to 70°C. and found that the serum agglutinated the three cultures to the same degree while the other Bacillus schottmiilleri cultures were agglutinated in only the lower dilutions of serum. Especially significant

28

PARATYPHOID BACILLI FROM ANIMALS

are the observations of Bainbridge and O'Brien (10). They compared cultures from cases of food poisoning with those from undoubted cases of paratyphoid fever. In Bacillus schottmillleri sera the former produced fine clumps and did not absorb the agglutinins for the immunizing strains, whereas the latter formed ffocculent clumps and absorbed all the agglutinins from the serum. Their control cultures of Bacillus suipe'stifer acted the same as those from food poisonings,but as these controls were obtained from German laboratories it is probable that they were the same as those I have called swine-typhus. Krumwiede, Valentine, and Kohn (11) separated from Bacillus schot~malleri by absorption tests a number of organisms obtained from rodents which probably belong to this group.
As noted above, when suspensions of agar slant growth or killed cultures are used as antigens in agglutination tests the difference between these animal cultures and Bacillus schoUmiiIleri could not be detected and it seems possible that the so called paratyphoid B bacilli that Jensen (5), Christiansen (12), and others have associated with diarrhea in calves are the same as the organisms I have called calf-typhus. Many of the paratyphoid B bacilli isolated from foodpoisonings quite possiblybelong to the same group but from theliterature one cannot draw any conclusions as the diagnosis has usually been made on the agglutination test without supplementary absorption tests. This subject is important because we want to know what type of infections man gets from the lower animals.
There are several well recognized groups of pathogenic animal paratyphoids besides enteritidis and the group considered here. The hog-
cholera bacillus, or better, Bacillus cholerce suis, described by Smith
(13), differs from the others by being highly pathogenic for rabbits. More recently (1) it has been shown to have distinct cultural differences from Bacillus schottmalleri. The Voldagsen bacillus described by Dammann and Stedefeder (14) and t h e " Ferkel typhus" bacillus described by Gli~sser (15) seem to be identical. They are differentiated from the other paratyphoids by their failure to act on mannitol and the fact that they produce little or no gas. Bacillus abortus equi, first described by Smith and Kilbome (I6) and later studied by Meyer and B oerner (17) and others, resembles Bacillus schottmialeri culturally, except that it fails to produce hydrogen sulfide, and on agar forms a

CARL TENBROECK

29

dry brittle growth. Serologically Meyer and Boerner, and Murray (18) place it in a group by itself. In its virulence for rabbits Smith and Kilborne pointed out that it resembled a mildly virulent hogcholera bacillus.
Jordan (19) and Reerstorp (20) have found a variety of so called intermediate paratyphoids in the intestinal tract of normal swine, and from children Lewis (21) and others have obtained paratyphoids which have been classified culturally by Graham-Smith (22). It is difficult to determine just what relation these paratyphoids of the normal digestive tract bear to the established groups. They differ serologically and culturally from the members of these severai groups but it is conceivable that under certain conditions they might invade the body and change their characters.
Smith and l~eagh (23) discussed the possibility of the host changing the agglutinative characters of organisms and such a possibility should be consideredhere. After passing from animal to man and becoming adapted to the latter, it is quite possible that organisms might change both their cultural and agglutinative characters. Careful study of food poisoning outbreaks due to eating meat containing these animal paratyphoids might throw some light on this subject. If such a change does occur it would result in much confusion. I have from time to time modified slightly the cultural characters of some of these paratyphoids by passage through animals, but on the whole the cultural and especially the agglutination characters are remarkably constant.
CONCLUSIONS.
1. In addition to the paratyphoid bacilli already named there exists a group which occurs in a variety of animals and which culturally is the same as Bacillus schottmiilleri. As a rule this group can be separated from the latter by the type of clumps formed when bouillon cultures are used as antigens, while other antigens and complement fixation tests have failed to differentiate it. Agglutination absorption tests sharply separate the animal from the human paratyphoids.
2. No differences have been detected between organisms of this group derived from a number of animals and a common name for them is desirable, but for the present it seems better to call them calf-,

30

PARATYPHOID BACILLI FROM ANIMALS

swine-, mouse-, etc., typhus, according to the animal from which they were isolated.
3. Evidence exists in the literature that these organisms have been associated with food infections in man, particularly with what have been called paratyphoid B infections, but this function, as well as the part they play in animal diseases, is a subject for further study.
4. Well defined groups of paratyphoid such as Bacillus cholerazsuis, the Voldagsen bacillus, Bacillus abortus equi, and Bacillus enteritidis are found in animals in addition to the organisms considered in this paper, and every attempt should be made to range newly isolated organisms in one or the other of these well recognized groups.
5. One of the objects in continuing this work was to find a method of differentiating these animal from the human paratyphoids less complicated than agglutination absorption. This object was not realized; the two groups are very similar and agglutination absorption seems to be the only means of classifying them.

ABSTRACT
Dry eye disease (DED) after cataract surgery is associated with various risk factors, while causing a wide range fof heterogeneous symptoms including decreased quality of vision. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of DED after cataract surgery. We searched PubMed and EMBASE and included studies on patients with

DED after cataract surgery, between January 2011 and June 2020. Study-specific estimates (DED prevalence rates after cataract surgery in patients without preexisting DED) were combined using one-group meta-analysis in a random-effects model. We included 36 studies published between 2013 and 2020. We included nine of these in the meta-analysis of DED prevalence after cataract surgery. Overall 37.4% (95% CI 22.6-52.3; 206/775) of patients without preexisting DED developed DED after cataract surgery. The risk

factors for DED after cataract surgery included age, female sex, systemic diseases, systemic medications, psychiatric conditions, preexisting DED, meibomian gland dysfunction, preservatives in eye drops, surgery techniques, and lifestyle. DED severity peak occurred 1 day postoperatively and persisted for at least 1-12 months following cataract surgery; therefore, consistent follow-up for DED is warranted for at least 1 month after cataract surgery. Topical administration of preservative-free diquafosol tetrasodium solution and preoperative meibomian gland treatment were effective in preventing and treating DED following cataract surgery. As more than one-third of patients develop DED after cataract surgery, careful DED management and treatment is needed after cataract surgery to improve satisfaction and vision quality.

Key Summary Points
This large-scale systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively present dry eye disease (DED) prevalence and its associated risk factors, specifically among patients who have undergone cataract surgery without preexisting DED.
A wide range of data on surgery-specific factors was analyzed (i.e., surgical techniques, postsurgical treatment), which contributed to a broader understanding of DED pathogenesis.
This study identified that 37.4% (95% CI 22.6-52.3; 206/775) of patients without preexisting DED developed DED following cataract surgery.
The timelines of symptom severity according to different measurement intervals and duration were compiled, yielding a more accurate pattern of DED progression following cataract surgery.

A major portion of the included studies were based on the Asian population, which calls for further verification of the generalizability of the results.
INTRODUCTION
Cataract surgery is an increasingly prevalent ophthalmic procedure owing to an aging society [1, 2]. Although it yields excellent results in most patients, some develop postoperative disorders, such as dry eye disease (DED) [3-5], with symptoms including dryness, foreign body sensation, and ocular fatigue [6, 7]. This negatively impacts the quality of vision (QOV) and work productivity and has economic repercussions [8], warranting preventative and management strategies for DED after cataract surgery [9].
The pathogenesis of DED after cataract surgery remains unclear, resulting in a lack of evidence-based, established treatment [9]. Moreover, there have been no systematic or large-scale studies on DED following cataract surgery in individuals without preexisting DED to comprehensively elucidate its risk factors, duration, and treatment.
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize the current evidence to identify the prevalence, characteristics, perioperative risk factors, treatment, and preventative measures for DED after cataract surgery.
METHODS
Outcomes
DED prevalence after cataract surgery was assessed by reviewing systematically evaluated and characterized studies focusing on risk factors, duration, treatment, and DED management after cataract surgery. From the relevant studies, we extracted pre- and postoperative results of DED examinations, including Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) [10-12], tear film breakup time (TFBUT), Schirmer's I test, corneal

fluorescein staining (CFS), tear meniscus height (TMH), tear osmolarity values (TOV) [13], severity peak, and postoperative disease duration. In reports of multiple severity peaks regarding different parameters, the parameter with the most peaks was chosen. Priority was given to subjective symptoms (i.e., OSDI) for any inter-parameter differences.
Search Strategy
We retrieved all articles published between January 1, 2011 and June 9, 2020 by combining the search terms [cataract AND (dry eye) NOT (review)] in key electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE). The search was conducted in June 2020. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines [14]. Table 1 presents the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search results were compiled using EndNote X9.3.2 software (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia). To maintain the quality standards for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies [15], the retrieved articles were screened by two researchers (M.M. and T.I.) who independently assessed eligible fulltext articles through consensus.
Data Extraction
Two independent reviewers (M.M. and T.I.) extracted the data from eligible articles using standardized data extraction sheets and then cross-checked the results. Inter-reviewer disagreements were resolved through discussions with a third reviewer (J.S.). The following data were extracted: first author name, publication date, study type, country, sample size, follow-up time after cataract surgery, and definition of DED. The following characteristics were assessed in patients with DED after cataract surgery: age, sex, ocular findings, DED prevalence, peak of DED severity, and duration of DED after cataract surgery. Ocular findings were assessed on the basis of the OSDI, TFBUT, CFS, Schirmer's I test, TMH, TOV, and presence of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). Figure 1a

Statistical Analyses
Study-specific estimates (prevalence rates of DED after cataract surgery) were combined through one-group meta-analysis in a randomeffects model using OpenMetaAnalyst version 12.11.14 (available from http://www.cebm. brown.edu/openmeta/) [16]. Subgroup analyses were performed using studies that reported on each specific outcome.

Ethics
This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.
RESULTS
The database search identified 280 articles (Fig. 1a). Three additional articles were selected from the reference lists of the included articles [17-19] and reviewed on the basis of their title and abstract. A total of 247 articles were excluded because of low relevance or article type (clinical guidelines, consensus documents, reviews, systematic reviews, and conference proceedings). Finally, 36 articles were included in the systematic review, nine of which were included in the meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of DED after cataract surgery in patients without preexisting DED.
Study Characteristics and Demographic Features
Table 2 presents the results of the included studies that were published between November 12, 2013, and June 3, 2020. The details include study type, country, sample size, followup time after cataract surgery, definition of DED, and DED-related clinical metrics such as OSDI and TFBUT.

DED Prevalence After Cataract Surgery
Table 2 presents DED prevalence in patients without preexisting DED. Among 775 patients without preexisting DED in nine identified studies [6, 18, 20, 23, 30, 32, 37, 50, 51], 206 (26.6%) individuals developed DED after cataract surgery.
A one-group meta-analysis of the nine studies reporting on DED prevalence after cataract surgery [6, 18, 20, 23, 30, 32, 37, 50, 51] yielded a 37.4% prevalence rate (206/775; 95% CI 22.6-52.3; Fig. 1b).
Severity Peak and Duration of DED After Cataract Surgery
Table 2 summarizes the severity peak and duration of DED after cataract surgery. Although early postoperative ocular surface changes began to recover within a month of cataract surgery [38], most studies reported that DED parameters, including subjective symptoms, TFBUT, CFS, tear secretion volume, and MGD, did not recover to baseline values by the end of the study, indicated as ``[ (study period).'' The peaks of DED severity usually occurred 1 week after cataract surgery, although the reported values ranged from 1 month to more than 1 year [6, 17, 19 -23, 26, 27, 29-35, 37, 40, 41, 44, 57, 58]. Notably, eight out of the 22 articles that reported severity peak at 1 month

postoperatively had their first measurement at 1 month [22, 26, 29-31, 35, 43, 46]. Several studies showed varying persistence of DED and ocular surface abnormalities ranging from 2 week to 12 months after cataract surgery [17, 18, 20, 21, 26, 29, 33, 35, 40, 44, 46, 51, 55, 56, 58], possibly preceded by a higher than baseline OSDI, short TFBUT, and MGD at 1 month postoperatively [35]. Corneal denervation or a higher TFBUT score induced by cataract surgery returned to baseline levels within 1-3 months of surgery [17, 59]. Jun et al. [46] reported that preservative-free diquafosol showed better efficacy regarding meibum quality at 1 and 3 months after cataract surgery than preservative-containing diquafosol or preservative-free hyaluronate.

Risk Factors for, Prevention, and Treatment of DED After Cataract Surgery

Accurately recognizing the individual risk factors and initiating perioperative intervention is critical for patients with preexisting DED, particularly for those with minimal signs or symptoms. This section discusses the reported risk factors (Table 3) and prevention/intervention strategies (Table 4) for DED after cataract surgery.

Age, Sex, and Lifestyle

Older age and female sex were associated with

DED

after

cataract

surgery

[18, 25, 30, 34, 37, 55]. Notably, Kohli et al. [37]

showed that individuals above the age of

60 years had worse OSDI, Schirmer test results,

TFBUT, CFS, and TMH at 2 weeks post-cataract

surgery. Prolonged exposure to visual display

terminals, particularly in developed countries,

is of concern for the increasing global DED

prevalence [61-66]. Villani et al. [51] suggested

that the use of computers might exacerbate

DED after cataract surgery, advising minimal

visual display terminal use during recovery.

Comorbidities: Systemic Diseases, Systemic Medications, and Psychiatric Conditions The association between DED after cataract surgery and diabetes mellitus was reported [51]. Sajnani et al. [18] evaluated the epidemiology of persistent postsurgical pain (PPP), which manifested as DED-like symptoms for 6 months postoperatively. Autoimmune disorders, nonocular chronic pain disorder, and use of antihistamines, anti-reflux medication, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and anti-insomnia medication were reported as risk factors for PPP; hormone replacement therapy, thyroid malfunction, psychiatric conditions, and systemic medication were also reported as risk factors for postoperative DED [51].
Preexisting DED Two studies [27, 50] reported correlations between preexisting DED and DED after cataract surgery. These studies suggest that preexisting DED may lead to more severe DED postoperatively. Traditional DED metrics that may predict DED after cataract surgery included TFBUT [30, 35, 51], higher CFS [30, 51], conjunctivochalasis [51], Schirmer's I test score [51], and TOV [25]. Additionally, the Ocular Surface Frailty Index (OSFI), developed for DED symptom-onset after cataract surgery [51], might aid in predicting ocular surface symptoms with OSFI C 0.3. Lid-parallel conjunctival folds and ocular allergy predicted DED to some extent [51].
MGD MGD affects tear-film stability and is strongly associated with DED [67]; the accelerated tearevaporation rate and the subsequent tear hyperhidrosis in MGD likely trigger DED development [35, 43, 51, 52, 68]. Clinically, this is observed as MGD aggravated by cataract surgery, with a positive correlation between MGD and DED-related indicators including postoperative TFBUT and CFS [52]. Conversely, a Chinese trial [43] has shown that preoperative MGD management might allow effective and optimal alleviation of obstructive-MGD and DED induced by cataract surgery.

Preservatives and NSAIDs in Eye Drops Preservative-containing topical eye drops for intraoperative or postoperative use, including benzalkonium chloride, may cause ocular surface damage stemming from epithelial cell injury and apoptosis and reduced goblet cell density [69, 70]. Jee et al. [22] compared the efficacy of preservative-free versus preservativecontaining sodium hyaluronate 0.1% and fluorometholone 0.1% eye drops after cataract surgery. The preservative-free group showed superior DED-related metrics, impression cytology findings, goblet cell count, tear interleukin1b and tumor necrosis factor-a levels, and catalase and superoxide dismutase levels at 2 months postoperatively. Further, a Korean study reported that compared with preservativecontaining diquafosol, preservative-free diquafosol 3% showed better efficacy in treating DED after cataract surgery [46].
Kato et al. [31] observed the negative effects of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) after cataract surgery on conjunctival goblet cell density, raising concerns about DED with prolonged topical NSAID administration. Interestingly, topical rebamipide, widely used to prevent oral NSAID-induced gastric mucosal damage [71], counteracts the reduction of conjunctival goblet cell density induced by diclofenac [31].

Treatment Selection and Adjuvant Therapies Artificial tears and sodium hyaluronate 0.1% are common first-line treatments for DED [66, 72]; however, treatments are shifting toward more complex and effective topical drops [73]. Diquafosol tetrasodium solution is reportedly effective for DED treatment after cataract surgery with comparative benefits over artificial tears or sodium hyaluronate 0.1% [29, 30, 33, 46].
Addition of trehalose to sodium hyaluronate also effectively reduces DED symptoms and improves clinical outcomes (TFBUT, OSDI) after cataract surgery, possibly owing to its propensity for deep hydration, lipid and protein stabilization, protection against oxidative insult, and epithelial cell recovery [45]. Fogagnolo et al. [54] reported improvements in TFBUT and OSDI with antioxidant solution usage for 2 weeks pre- and postoperatively, implicating antioxidants in protecting ocular surface homeostasis from surgical invasions. Oral lactoferrin [23] and omega-3 fatty acid [60] (over-the-counter supplements established as effective adjuvants for DED treatment) have also been implicated in the management of DED after cataract surgery.
Surgical Techniques Increased duration of surgery and longer phacoemulsification time may be risk factors for postoperative DED, compounded by increased

microscopic light exposure [37]. Further, femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery is among the reported risk factors for DED after cataract surgery [6, 40, 44, 74], likely owing to peri-conjunctival injury caused by the femtosecond laser suction ring.
These results suggest that light filters, short surgery duration, adequate irrigation, and soft manipulation of the ocular surface tissue may minimize surgery-related complications [20]. Use of an ophthalmic viscosurgical device-- normally used to prevent intraocular tissue damage during cataract surgery--on the ocular surface has shown protective effects for a week postoperatively with significant improvements in TFBUT, corneal ocular staining score, and OSDI [48]. Administration of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose on the corneal surface also

results in improved clinical outcomes related to tear film and ocular surface health [32].

DISCUSSION

This is the systematic review and meta-analysis

to comprehensively present DED prevalence

after cataract surgery that included 775 indi-

viduals

from

nine

articles

[6, 18, 20, 23, 30, 32, 37, 50, 51]. We observed

that 37.4% (95% CI 22.6-52.3; 206/775) of

patients without preexisting DED developed

DED postoperatively, highlighting the impor-

tance of perioperative DED management in

addressing postoperative patient dissatisfaction

and decreased QOV. The global DED prevalence

is 5-50% [75]; inclusion of cataract surgery-

1326

Ophthalmol Ther (2022) 11:1309-1332

related DED may expand it to half of the global population. Thus, a thorough and effective DED assessment during the perioperative period of cataract surgery is warranted [8, 62].
The major mechanisms underlying DED pathogenesis include tear-film instability and ocular surface inflammation [47, 76-80]. We observed that DED after cataract surgery was weakly and strongly associated with tear secretion (Schirmer's I test) and TFBUT, respectively [22, 29, 30, 35, 44, 52]. Additionally, postoperative upregulation of inflammatory mediators contributes to DED development [27, 77-81], which simultaneously alters subjective perception and sensitivity of the ocular surface nerve plexuses [82]. This might be attributed to the surgical procedure itself and/or preservatives in postsurgical eye drops, both of which contribute to inflammation and tear-film instability [37, 83, 84]. Larger corneal wounds [84], longer microscopic exposure times [21, 37], and greater phacoemulsification energy [37] increase the likelihood of DED after cataract surgery, including the persistent decrease of conjunctival goblet cells despite an uncomplicated phacoemulsification [59, 84].
MGD is closely related to DED pathology [35, 43, 52], and Han et al. [21] reported persistent MGD after cataract surgery without accompanying structural changes even in patients without preexisting MGD. A Japanese study [56] focused on TFBUT patterns in patients with DED after cataract surgery, observing a random break pattern that was predominant during the postoperative period, which is a common feature in evaporative DED and is often associated with MGD [85]. Therefore, owing to potential comorbidity, MGD should be preoperatively evaluated in all patients regardless of preexisting DED [21, 26, 35, 52].
Additionally, we investigated the risk factors for DED after cataract surgery, which were consistent with the characteristics reported by epidemiological studies on DED in the elderly [86]. Patients with traditional DED risk factors [8, 63-65] may present with DED after cataract surgery; therefore, preventative measures should be considered. Other non-ocular risk factors include various systemic diseases,

systemic medications, and psychiatric conditions. Notably, diabetes mellitus is among the systemic risk factors for DED [87], likely affected by tear hyperosmolarity and tear-film instability resulting from dysfunction of lacrimal functional units and the ocular surface. The effects of hyperglycemia on the lacrimal gland functional unit components are systematically transmitted via neural connections, resulting in abnormal tear production and composition, both of which contribute to DED [8]. Ultrasonic energy produced during phacoemulsification can cause free radical formation [88], which may compound the damage. Although the exact underlying mechanisms remain unclear, other systemic diseases and treatments damage the conjunctiva, lacrimal glands, goblet cells, and peripheral nerve innervations, predisposing the affected population to DED after cataract surgery.
There is a recent consensus regarding the concomitant role of neurogenic stress and ocular surface inflammation on DED pathogenesis [8]. Additionally, DED is associated with other chronic pain conditions and may alter the genetic susceptibility for depression [65, 89]. Patients with DED usually present with chronic pain syndromes, which are associated with increased severity of subjective DED symptoms, even with comparable objective ocular surface signs [90]. Anxiety disorders and usage of anxiolytics, antidepressants, or sleep medication are also associated with DED after cataract surgery [18]. Extrapolating the psychogenic effects on ocular sensations, it is possible that only the subjective indicators are elevated for specific populations, although further studies are required to validate the hypothesis. The relationship between surgical techniques and DED after cataract surgery was also analyzed. Studies have reported a correlation of DED examination values with microscopic light exposure time [37] and phacoemulsification energy used [37]; surgeons should strategize to minimize both factors in patients with preoperative DED or risk factors.
Pathological changes and inflammatory kinetics preceding DED after cataract surgery are crucial when determining postoperative treatment and management. DED severity after

Ophthalmol Ther (2022) 11:1309-1332

1327

cataract surgery tends to peak around 1 week postoperatively [6, 19, 20, 32, 34, 40-42, 44, 45, 52-54]. Notably, numerous studies reported postoperative follow-ups scheduled after 1 week and 1 month, and the true peak of DED symptoms most likely lies within this time period. Kasetsuwan et al. [20] proposed that the timeline of corneal neuron regeneration and DED symptom exacerbation within 1 postoperative month may be correlated. As new neurite cells emerge, there is a stark increase in neural growth factors at 25 days postoperatively, indicative of sub-epithelial corneal axon regeneration. Khanal et al. [91] reported that alterations in corneal neuronal plexuses and a postoperative decrease in the blink rate reduced corneal sensitivity and feedback. Moreover, the authors reported recovery of tear functions within 1 postoperative month, supporting the existence of a DED peak within 1 week and 1 month postoperatively. Notably, this result also coincides with the observed increased tear evaporation up to 1 month postoperatively, associated with usage of benzalkonium chloride preservatives [92].
DED duration after cataract surgery is clinically important. Studies have reported a wide range of DED duration, from 1 months to more than 1 year [17, 18, 20, 21, 26, 29, 33, 35, 40, 44, 46, 51, 55, 56, 58]. Further, some studies have reported that surgery-induced invasive corneal changes recover within 1-3 months [17, 59]. The long-term effects of DED after cataract surgery remain unclear as most patients, particularly after successful bilateral cataract surgery, require follow-up for only a few months. While further studies are needed, the results show that consistent follow-up for DED is necessary for at least 1 month after cataract surgery.
Postoperative eye drops should be carefully selected owing to variable efficacy and the presence of preservatives. Several studies have suggested a correlation between preservatives and DED after cataract surgery [22, 46], advising preservative-free treatment options for surgery recipients. Considering the multifactorial pathophysiology of DED and the wide-ranging effects of cataract surgery on the ocular surface, future strategies for addressing DED after

cataract surgery require surgeons to gain a better understanding of treatment and prevention methods.
This review has several limitations. First, only a few included studies had a follow-up period of more than 1 year, which limited the analysis of long-term effects. Second, approximately three-quarters of the included articles were published in Asian countries, which partially limits the generalizability of the findings. Third, the criteria and dry eye examination techniques for DED diagnosis have not been standardized across countries and practices, and the included studies showed inconsistencies in their diagnostic standards. Future studies should consider further standardization of the diagnostic criteria and generalizability of the study results through the inclusion of participants of different ethnic groups, longer observation periods, and use of standardized guidelines for DED diagnosis, such as those proposed by the Tear Film & Ocular Surface Society [47] and the Asia Dry Eye Society [76].
CONCLUSIONS
This study comprehensively analyzed DED prevalence and characteristics after cataract surgery. It presents a concise and up-to-date description of the risk factors, prevention, and treatments. Our findings contribute to generating increased awareness among physicians, researchers, and the general population regarding DED after cataract surgery and encourage the development of effective preventative and treatment strategies.

PRESSOR SUBSTANCES FROM THE BODY FLUIDS OF MAN IN HEALTH AND DISEASE*
BY IRVINE I-I. PAGE, M.D.
(From the Hospital of The RockefellerInstitute for Medical Research)
(Received for publication, October 4, 1934)
It has been a theory of long standing that high blood pressure is due to circulation of a pressor substance acting on the peripheral blood vessels. Convincing proof either for or against this conception does not appear to have been established. It seemed to us, therefore, that the problem was worthy of intensive study.
Much has been written on the subject of pressor substances in blood, but due to the fact that the methods employed in the preparation and testing of the extracts are so divergent, only certain of them need be considered here.
Vasoconstrictor substances in the alcoholic extract of blood from hypertensive patients have perhaps been demonstrated (1, 3, 9, 10), but their presence has been denied (11-13).
Bohn (9, 10) prepared alcoholic extracts of blood and tested them on curarized cats, anesthetized with ethyl urethane. He concluded that a pressor substance was present in the blood of patients suffering from nephritic hypertension, from edampsia, and from malignant nephrosderosis, but, without exception, blood from patients suffering from essential hypertension or normal subjects contained none. The substance was found to be ultrafiltrable and rendered inactive by exposure to ultraviolet irradiation or to alkali. It also acted as an antidinretie. Bohn believes that the material is pituitrin. These experiments were taken as proving Volhard's hypothesis that the mechanisms of nephritic and of essential hypertension are fundamentally different, the former depending on the presence of a chemical substance and the latter being predominantly of a nervous origin.
Marx and Hefke (14) also found that alcoholic extracts of blood from nephritic hypertensive patients induced a prolonged rise of blood pressure level in nonanesthetized dogs. Ultrafiltrates were not active, contrary to Bohn's results. Extracts from the blood of normal persons were inactive, while those from epileptic patients, shortly before or during convulsions, were strongly positive. No relationship between the height of the pressure and the amount of pressor substance was found.

PI~ESSOR SUBSTANCES FROM BODY FLUIDS

Plasma of eclamptic patients acidified (pH 4 to 4.5) with acetic acid and passed through an ultrafilter was studied by Anselmino and Hoffmann (15-17) in anesthetized rabbits. They appeared able to demonstrate the presence of a substance in the blood of eclamptic patients and those suffering from toxemia of pregnancy that they considered identical with the pressor hormone of the posterior pituitary body. They obtained active antidluretic ultrafiltrates only when edema was present in the patient, and active pressor extracts only when the blood pressure was over 180 ram. of mercury. The amount of the substance in the blood appeared to parallel the severity of the symptoms. Byrom and Wilson (18) have failed to find antidiuretic hormone in ultrafiltrates of plasma of ten cases of preeclamptic toxemia and three cases of eclampsia with edema.
Many investigators have presented evidence which suggests that the pressor hormone of the posterior pituitary body may be in part responsible for the maintenance of vascular tone (20-33). Others have denied that the evidence is convincing (34-38). Hoyle (37) has clearly demonstrated that normal spinal fluid contains, at most, only a trace of pituitrin, nor is it increased in fluid from patients suffering from nephritis or essential hypertension.
Efforts to detect adrenalin or adrenalin-like substances in the blood by the use of the intestinal segment method or the Trendelenburg frog preparation have led to contradictory results (39-51). No proof has yet been offered that the blood in vivo contains such substances in active form.
Chemical Qualities of Pressor Extracts
Extraction and Concentration.--Blood was drawn into a syringe containing heparin from the antecubital vein of the patient. Moderate compression of the arm by the use of a tourniquet did not affect the amount of pressor substance. Both sodium citrate and potassium oxalate have been employed as anticoagulants and, while it could not be definitely proven that they interfered with the animal testing, heparin seemed less likely to complicate the pharmacological assay.
The blood was immediately centrifuged (3 minutes) and the plasma pipetted into 95 per cent ethyl alcohol in the proportion of 10 cc. plasma to 90 cc. alcohol. 10 minutes were usually required for the whole procedure. The flasks were then placed in the ice box for from 2 to 24 hours, the precipitated protein and lipid illtered off, employing strong suction, and the clear filtrate concentrated to one-half the original plasma volume. The removal of the alcohol was carried out in a Claissen flask with water-cooled condenser under vacuum (1 to 2 ram.). The temperature in the flask did not rise above 20°C.
It is essential that all alcohol be evaporated from the extract. Small amounts allowed to remain in solution markedly accentuate the action of the pressor substance. It seemed desirable as a control whenever a great rise had been observed in the level of the blood pressure of the test animal to evaporate the extract still further under vacuum. The type of blood pressure curve resulting from injection of extract containing alcohol is similar to that from alcohol-free extract except

that the level to which the pressure rises is much greater. This precaution must be rigidly observed.
An alternative method was also employed, in which, after removal of the alcohol, absolute alcohol was added in the proportion of 40 cc. for every 1 cc. of concentrate. The mixture was quickly chilled to 4°C., and after standing 6 hours filtered, and the alcohol removed under vacuum.
Other solvents than alcohol have been tried. Acetone extracts were in almost every case either moderately or strongly depressor in action. Ether extracts were indifferent, being neither pressor nor depressor.
Extracts prepared by the ordinary Folin-Wu phosphotungstic acid precipitation were inactive. Trichloroacetie acid dissolved more depressor than pressor substance and, furthermore, the sodium acetate formed on adjusting the pH to that of the body interfered with the animal testing.
Precipitation by tannic acid at pH 3.0 proved an effective protein precipitant, but the removal of the excess tannic acid by the addition of barium hydroxide was troublesome. Excess barium was removed with sulfuric acid. While a small amount of residual tannic acid does not interfere with animal testing, any residual barium may seriously disturb the results. The pressor substance does not appear to be destroyed by the treatment.
Shifting the hydrogen ion concentration of plasma to pH 4.5 by the addition of normal acetic acid had no effect on the efficiency of the alcohol extraction. The concentration of the alcohol employed in the extraction, as long as the protein precipitation was complete, also affected the results insignificantly.
The extract prepared by the alcohol method was usually protein-
free as measured by the sulfosalicylic acid method. Often relatively
large amounts of lipids were present, and while it was demonstrated
that they did not interfere in the animal testing, the lipids were usually
removed by cooling the extract to 8°C. and decanting the clear fluid.
The extracts were tested usually within 12 to 24 hours, but often im-
mediately after concentration. Serial experiments showed that the
time of extraction with alcohol in the refrigerator made little difference
in the amount of pressor material extracted. After removal of the
alcohol, however, the extracts, especially if kept at room temperature,
tended to lose their pressor quality and become progressively more
depressor. If extracts were not tested immediately, they were kept
at 8°C. It has been our experience that the technique for the preparation of extracts must be carried out with exactness and rapidity,. otherwise depressor substances are liberated. These substances may be fatal to the test animal unless caution is used.
Coagulation as a Factor in the Production of Pressor Substance.~

PP~SSOR SUBSTANCES FRO~ BODY ~'LUIDS

Every care was taken to prevent coagulation by the use of the anticoagulant heparin, but the necessary manipulations during extraction might have allowed some alteration to occur. After it had been shown that ascitic fluid also contained pressor substance a way was open for excluding coagulation as a factor in the production of the blood pressure-elevating principle. During a paracentesis ascitic fluid was allowed to flow directly from the trocar into alcohol. The extract of this fluid was neither more nor less active than heparinized or citrated ascitic fluid. It seems reasonable therefore to suppose that the substance is present in plasma and is not produced as the result of coagulation.
Ultrafiltration.--After exhaustive investigation it became evident
that ultrafiltration could not be utilized for the separation of pressor substance from plasma.
Various methods for the preparation of ultrafiltrates have been employed. Collodion sacs of various porosity (100 cc. capacity), and pear-shaped porcelain thimbles on which acetic acid collodion (6 to 8 per cent Shering-Kalbaum 1) was deposited as a membrane, were found convenient. Ultrafiltrates were also prepared by high pressure (150 kilos per sq. cm. of nitrogen) filtration2 through membranes of various density (30 to 400 minutes). The high pressure apparatus offered the great advantage that 10 cc. or more of ultrafiltrate could be obtained in ~ hour, the time depending on the porosity of the filter membrane.
Ultrafiltrates were prepared from plasma at normal pH and from plasma which had been made acid (pH 4.5) by the addition of acetic acid. Neutralization of the acid dialysates (to phenolphthalein) was performed immediately before injecting into the animal. Ordinarily the ultrafiltrate was not concentrated. When concentration was desired it was effected below 20°C. with the aid of a vacuum. The ultrafiltrates were clear and protein-free as estimated with the sulfosalicylic acid reagent. 52 ultraffltrates have been tested.
Partition.--Active extracts prepared by the alcohol method were
extracted with chloroform in a separatory funnel. The solvent was removed under vacuum after the addition of water. Such aqueous extracts were vaso-active. Many experiments have shown that the pressor substance is extracted from aqueous solution by this strong organic solvent, often almost completely. Reversing the extraction,

that is extracting the substance from chloroform after acidification, was not so successful, only about 20 per cent being so recoverable. Ethyl acetate also removes some of the pressor substance from the water phase but does not appear as efficient as chloroform. Plasma which has been allowed to stand at room temperature yields an extract which is powerfully depressor and partition of this extract with chloroform does not leave the depressor substances in the water phase.
Heat Stability.--Plasma extract may be heated to boiling for about 1 minute with but partial loss of pressor activity (nine experiments). Longer heating even at lower temperatures either liberates depressor substances in such quantity that they overshadow the pressor principle or else the pressor substance is destroyed leaving the depressor substances unantagonized. The experimental evidence does not allow us to decide which reaction had occurred.
Is the Pressor Substance Lipid in Nature?--The gross fats m a y be frozen out of the extracts without substantial loss of pressor activity. These fats in aqueous emulsion when injected were not vaso-active. Further removal of phosphatide was achieved by precipitation with a large excess of acetone and allowing the precipitate to agglomerate at a temperature just above freezing. The supernatant liquor after the addition of water and the removal of the acetone under vacuum remained vaso-active. It thus seems unlikely that any of the ordinary lipids are involved in the activity of these extracts.
Vascular Responses of the Test Animals
Method.--Cats weighing 3 to 4 kilos which had been without food for 18 hours were usually employed as test animals. Lactating or pregnant animals responded to vascular stimuli in a peculiarly irregular manner, hence were not used in these experiments. The animal was anesthetized and a tracheal cannula inserted. Both vagi were then cut and the blood pressure recorded, by a mercury manometer, either from the right carotid artery, cannulated wellbelow the cricoid cartilage, or from the femoral artery. Interference with the circulation of the thyroid gland was avoided. The femoral artery was employed for blood pressure measurement when injury to the carotid sinus and aortic nerves was to be avoided. Sodium citrate, 20 per cent, was employed as anticoagulant in the manometer tubing because it has been found that should some of the solution flow into the vascular system its action can be quickly nullified by the intravenous injection of 5 per cent calcium lactate. The injections of warmed extract, usually of 5 cc. volume, were made slowly and evenly into a cannulated femoral vein. The ani-

72

P:P..ESSOR SUBSTANCES ~ R O ~ BODY FLUIDS

mals were kept warm and the temperature noted from time to time by means of a rectal thermometer.
Anesthaics.--A variety of anesthetics have been studied with regard to their
suitability for pressor extract assay. Ether proved satisfactory when administered in gentle puffs of warm air from a windshield wiper type of artificial respirator but with the tracheal cannula open to the outside air. It was found essential to keep the respiration normal and unimpeded by the respirator.
Ethyl urethane given subcutaneously 3 to 4 hours before the experiment in doses of 7 to 10 cc. of a 25 per cent solution was found equally satisfactory and was employed in many of our experiments.
Amytal (iso-amyl ethyl barbituric acid) administered in doses of 60 mg. per kilo produced a smooth anesthesia without marked fluctuations in the level of the blood pressure but the response to extract was not as great as that when ether or ethyl urethane was employed. This lack of sensitivity is surmised to be due to the fact that this barbituric acid derivative stabilizes the autonomic nervous system in such a manner that vasomotor responses are buffered.
Pento-barbital (1-methyl-butyl ethyl barbituric acid) administered intraperitoneally in doses of 40 mg. per kilo gave an excellent anesthesia and the responses were similar to those following amytal narcosis, with the exception that early in the course of the experiment, depressor responses were likely to be elicited by extracts of known pressor activity.
Chloretone (0.4 gm. per kilo given by stomach tube) depressed the responsiveness to pressor extract to a marked degree.
Course of the Vascular Responses to Pressor Substance.--It was ob-
served that the same extract at one time produced a marked rise in
the animals' blood pressure, whereas, later in the course of the experi-
ment either the response was small or none was elicited. That the
extract had deteriorated in so short a time did not seem probable.
Extracts which had assayed both active and inactive tested on the
same animal were reassayed the next and subsequent days on other
animals. Again the same variability was noted. The conclusion
seemed justified that the variability lay in the response of the animal
and not in the extracts. On analyzing the data derived from the blood pressure records of a
large number of cats it became evident that under the conditions of our experiments, especially when ether was employed as anesthetic,
fairly definite periods could be recognized during which the magnitude
of the response was reasonably constant. Since the responsiveness during the different periods varied greatly it became evident that to obtain comparable results the assay would have to be performed dur-

IRVINE H. PAGE

73

ing the same period. This observation was established on such a large number of animals, because the truth or falsity of this observation lies at the crux of the important problem of the quantitation of the pressor substance.
During Period 1 (Fig. 1) the blood pressure is high and tends to fall rather rapidly and progressively. The animal is usually but slightly responsive to plasma extract during this period, indeed pressor extracts may produce depressor reactions. Period 2 is characterized by a moderately low (about 108 to 120 ram. Hg) steady blood pressure and may last for 1 to 3 hours. It is during this interval that the animal is most sensitive to pressor substances. As the third period ap-

proaches the pressure very gradually rises to a level usually greater than the initial pressure. At this level it remains almost fixed and will carry on for hours without significant alteration. The responses are exceedingly sluggish. It is during this period that an extract which had previously proven active may seem entirely devoid of pressor activity. Period 4 sets in when the animal is fast failing. During this period the responses are usually very irregular and are often confused by asphyxial blood pressure waves. Experiments performed to determine whether this course of events is the normal one, under prolonged anesthesia indicate that it is (Fig. 2).
It must be recognized that this division of the vascular reactivity into periods is arbitrary. The periods are not so distinct when the

fixed hypnotics are employed as anesthetics. Some hypnotics have the serious disadvantage of damping the vascular responses to pressor extracts to a degree that makes the interpretation of the records difficult. Furthermore, the non-reactive phases (Phase 3) are more difficult to detect.
If extracts are not tested during periods of approximately the same reactivity it is apparent that false results will be obtained. Our problem, namely whether the pressor substance is increased in amount in the plasma of patients suffering from hypertension, could not be answered until this fact was understood. It is not sufficient to test the animal at the beginning of the experiment with extracts of the plasma of normal individuals, and if no response is elicited, assume that any other extracts which produced a rise in pressure are "active." The extracts to be compared must be tested within as short a time interval as is feasible, and in alternating order.
Methods for Estimating the Reactivity o/Test Animals to Pressor Extracts
Vascular Response to Peripherally Acting Substances.--The hope that the character of the response of animals to a pressor extract might be predicted by preliminary study of the responses to such powerful pressor and depressor drugs as adrenalin, pitressin, choline, adenylic acid, and histamine, proved illusory. Systematic studies, on a large number of animals, showed conclusively that no parallel or reciprocal relationship existed. These drugs which act primarily on the peripheral blood vessels produced excellent responses when pressor extracts no longer influenced the blood pressure level. Indeed, as will be evident later, the recognition of this fact proved an important key to the understanding of the pharmacology of the pressor substance.
Reactivity as Measured by Carbon Dioxide Inhalation.--The reactivity of the "vasomotor center" was tested from time to time during the course of the experiment by the administration of carbon dioxideair mixtures.
10 per cent carbon dioxideair mixtures were prepared in a gasometer and 800 cc. portions delivered into a rubber balloon. The gas mixture was administered by means of a No. 10 French catheter, inserted through the rubber tube which delivered the ether, into the tracheal cannula. The tip of the catheter reached

76

PRESSOR SUBSTANCES FROM BODY FLUIDS

to the bifurcation of the trachea in order to insure delivery of the carbon dioxide to the lungs. The tracheal cannula remained partially open in order not to interfere with spontaneous breathing. The test dose of carbon dioxide-air mixture required 100 seconds for delivery. An alternative method consisted in the insertion of a flutter valve between the gas balloon and the catheter and a second one on the tracheal outlet) It was necessary to stop the administration of the anesthetic when this latter system was employed.
During the administration of the test dose of gas the blood pressure began to rise and remained at an elevated level for 2 to 3 minutes, then fell to the original

level. In most of our experiments the reactivity of the vascular system was first tested with CO2-air, then the test dose of plasma extract given.
The results show that when the animal exhibits the greatest response to CO2-air mixture the response to pressor extract is also marked. Exact parallelism is not always seen. After some time has elapsed (1 to 3 hours) the action of both may become weaker. Finally,

they elicit no further response. Even high concentrations of carbon dioxide are ineffective (Table I). This is the period designated as 4 (Fig. 1).

Reactivity as Measured by the Response to Carotid Sinus S t i m u l a t i o n . Occlusion of both common carotid arteries after bilateral vagotomy normally produces a marked rise in systemic blood pressure, due to

78

PRESSOR SUBSTANCES FROM BODY FLUIDS

stimulation of the carotid sinuses. The nervous connection with the vasomotor center is through the glossopharyngeal nerve. This reflex has been utilized as a means of determining the reactivity of the animal to pressor extract. It has been found that there is a general parallelism between the rise in blood pressure produced by occlusion of the carotid arteries and the responsiveness of the animal to extracts. The parallelism is by no means exact, but is a useful means of determining non-reactive periods.
It has also been possible to demonstrate that the extract in some manner sensitizes the mechanism responsible for the sinus reflex4 (Fig. 3).
The rise in blood pressure following sinus stimulation is considerably greater after the injection of extract than before. Extracts which, through some fault in preparation, were depressant to the systemic blood pressure level, invariably markedly reduced the reflex sensitivity. The substance which causes increased sensitivity is contained in the pressor extract alone because ultrafiltrates of plasma had no effect in altering the response to reflex stimulation.
It has not been ascertained whether the rise in blood pressure incident to injection of extract is responsible for the increased sensitivity to the reflex stimulation. Increase in sensitivity has often been observed in experiments where the rise of blood pressure level due to the injected extract was very small.
Other Methods of Control and Precautions Necessary to Observe in Assaying Pressor Extract.--
(a) Rise in blood pressure incident to the intravenous injection of indifferent fluids must always be estimated by the injection of 5 cc. of warm saline. Certain animals are sensitive to changes in blood volume and this, although rare, cautions against the acceptance of one or even two positive results as indicating the presence of pressor substance.
(b) Since in the preparation of plasma extracts the water-soluble elements of the blood become more concentrated than normal, for control purposes artificial extracts were prepared containing three times the concentration of sodium chloride and urea found in normal blood. No clear effect on the blood pressure level was observed from the injection of 5 cc. of this solution.
4We were fortunate in having the direction of Professor Dautrebande of Liege, Belgium, during this part of the work. Dogs under chloralose anesthesia were employed in some of the experiments. These animals, according to Professor Dautrebande's experience, are most suitable for carotid sinus experimentation.

IRVlNE H. PAGE

79

(c) Injections should not be made when the blood pressure is falling at a rapid rate. The pressure fall may be checked by the extract injection and the blood pressure assume a fixed level; it may continue to fall or it may suddenly climb rapidly. None of these responses give any clue as to the potency of the pressor substance in the extract.
(d) Injections must not be attempted when changes either in the rhythm or the amplitude of the pulse are noted on the kymographic record.
(e) The injection must be made slowly and with great evenness, otherwise sharp transient elevations in the pressure curve often occur. In spite of this precaution in some animals a temporary rise in pressure cannot be avoided even when small amounts of saline are injected.
(f) In general it has been found undesirable to test extracts in animals in which the blood pressure is exceptionally high or low. The usual level at which our tests were made was about 100 to 140 mm. of mercury.
(g) The respiration must be moderately slow and regular and in no way hindered by the respirator. Usually, during periods when the natural breathing had stopped, the vascular responses were at first very sluggish and if anoxemia supervened they became highly irregular.
(h) In order to compare the potency of two extracts, the injections should be given within as short a space of time as is feasible, to guard against changes in the sensitivity of the animal to the extract. It has been found best to administer the smallest doses of the extract that will produce a rise in blood pressure which is definite, and to follow this injection with the extract with which it is to be compared as soon as the pressure has returned to the original level. The first extract is then again injected to make sure that the animal is still reactive. While this method demands much time and relatively large amounts of extract it has seemed the only one which is reliable.
Pharmacology of Pressor Extracts
The typical pressor response consists in a relatively slow rise in the level of the blood pressure and the steady maintenance of the elevated level for some time (Fig. 4). No preliminary depression of the level of blood pressure occurs.
The Action of Plasma and Ascitic Fluid Extracts on Cats Treated with Ergotoxine.--In order to determine whether the response to pressor
extracts could be influenced by ergotoxine, cats under ethyl urethane anesthesia were first tested with 1 cc. of 1:100,000 adrenalin followed by 5 cc. of pressor extract as control. Now, 1 rag. of ergotoxine tartrate (gynergen, Sandoz) was injected intravenously and after 2 minutes the animal was retested with adrenalin and extract. It could be shown that althcugh reversal of the adrenalin pressor effect had

been produced the rise in blood pressure resulting from plasma or ascitic fluid extract was not altogether abolished. After large doses of ergotoxine the central nervous system of the animal appeared depressed as shown by the fact that the responses to occlusion of the carotid arteries were very weak. When this occurred the pressor extracts were also almost ineffective.
Influence of Cocaine and Atropine on Response to Extracts.--It is well known that cocaine "sensitizes" the vascular response to adrenalin. Therefore it seemed desirable to ascertain whether this drug would influence the response to pressor extracts.
Cocaine (2 rag. per kilo) was injected intravenously into the cat under ethyl urethane anesthesia after the vascular response to adrenalin solution (1.5 cc. of 1:100,000) and to 5 cc. of pressor extract had been determined. The same amount of adrenalin was again injected to be certain that the magnitude of the response had increased and the pressor extract then injected. Adrenalin raised the pressure 10 rnm. Hg before cocaine was given and 30 ram. Hg afterward. The extract raised the pressure level 18 ram. Hg and after cocaine 21 ram. It seems safe, therefore, to conclude that cocaine in the dosage we have employed does not affect the response to extract to any marked degree. No evident alteration in the responsiveness of the vascular system to carotid sinus stimulation was observed as the result of cocaine injection.
To ascertain the effect of atropine on the pressor response both cats and rabbits were given atropine by vein until the characteristic reversal of the action of choline from depressor to pressor had occurred. Active plasma extracts were found quite as active after atropinization as before.
Effect of Curare on the Pressor Respome.--Animals under ether anesthesia were curarized by repeated intravenous injections of 3 rag. doses of curare until normal respiration was completely paralyzed. Artificial respiration was now begun.
The response to pressor extract was sluggish in such animals. As there seemed no advantages over the ordinary method of assay and there were definite disadvantages, the procedure was not further employed.
Response of the Kidneys to Pressor Extracts.--In order to ascertain what effect the pressor extracts exerted on the kidneys' volume, the

82

PRESSOR SUBSTANCES FROM BODY FLUIDS

right kidney of the test animal was placed within a Livingston glass oncometer. The volume changes were registered by a small Brodie bellows.
Observation of many curves from such experiments convinces one of the extraordinary autonomy of the kidneys' circulation. Under apparently identical circumstances the kidneys may shrink or swell following the injection of certain substances. In general, the active plasma extracts tended to cause the renal volume to increase slightly though the opposite effect may be observed when the blood pressure rise is great. Without measurements of the blood flow through the kidney it is not possible to state whether vasodilatation or constriction had occurred. As has been pointed out by Richards and Plant (52) epinephrin may cause the renal volume to increase but simultaneously constrict the efferent arterioles, thus causing increased intraglomerular pressure.
As the result of pithing animals the renal volume curve follows accurately that of the carotid blood pressure, regardless of the agent employed to produce blood pressure changes (Fig. 5).
Changes in Peripheral Blood Supply as Measured Oncometrically.-Changes in peripheral blood supply of the hind leg were measured by an oncometer connected with a Brodie bellows. The results of measurements on sixteen animals show that ordinarily a moderate constriction in the leg volume occurs following the injection of plasma extracts. The constriction is initiated rather more slowly than the change in renal volume but it also lasts somewhat longer.
Response to Pressor Extract after Evisceration.--It could be shown by the oncometric method that, while both the renal and the peripheral blood vessels constricted as the result of the injection of the pressor extract, the action was not powerful. It seemed possible, therefore, that the splanchnic vessels constituted a not inconsiderable portion of the constricted area during the rise in systemic blood pressure.
Mter preliminary determination of the response to 5 cc. of plasma extract and the reactivity of the carotid sinus reflex, the anesthetized animal was eviscerated in the usual manner. The responses were again tested shortly after the blood pressure had steadied itself followingthe operation. An example may be given to illustrate the results of this procedure. Beforeeviscerationthe pressor response to the extract consisted in a rise in blood pressure of 22 ram. Hg, and

that due to carotid sinus stimulation was 16 mm. Hg. After evisceration the extract raised the blood pressure level 10 ram. Hg and the carotid sinus stimulation, 24 ram. Hg. The systemic blood pressure fellfrom 108 ram. Hg to 84 mm. Hg as the result of the operation.
The findings suggest that constriction of the vessels of the splanchnic area plays a large part in the elevation of blood pressure level resulting from the injection of pressor extract.
Effect of Adrenalectomy on the Effect of Pressor Extracts.--The possibility that the pressor action of plasma extracts might be due to stimulation of the adrenal gland causing the secretion of adrenalin was studied by bilateral removal of these glands. Recent experiments have shown that certain pharmacological agents do in fact owe at least part of their action to the increased liberation of epinephrin into the circulation.
After preliminary testing of the potency of an extract on a cat under ether anesthesia, the adrenal glands were either tied off or extirpated. The lumbar approach to the glands was employed. The extracts were again tested within 10 minutes and 1 hour after adrenalectomy.
The results from ten such experiments indicate that rather than a decreased response, the opposite was found. The increase, however, was relatively small, and in view of the spontaneous alterations in reactivity of the animal it does not seem justifiable to conclude that adrenalectomy causes sensitization to pressor extracts.
The Effect of Bilateral Vagotomy.--Extracts tested before and after bilateral vagotomy did not exhibit any characteristic difference. When the vagi were intact, spontaneous fluctuations in the level of the blood pressure were more apt to appear, consequently in most of our experiments this operation was performed.
Does the Animal Develop Immunity to the Pressor Action of Plasma Extracts?--Since it is well known that repeated injection of extracts of the posterior lobe of the pituitary result in the gradual development of immunity in animals to further vascular stimulation, it seemed desirable to ascertain if this were true of plasma extracts° It was found that the second response is just as great and often greater than the first. Indeed, the pressure level can be built up step-wise by the repeated injection of extract. As the blood pressure reaches levels above 160 ram. Hg the response to additional extract is likely to be

o

~ v

86

reduced. While "immunity" may develop in the sense that the animal no longer responds to extract this has seemed to be due to failure of the central nervous system because, coincident with the "immunity," the animal fails to respond to inspired CO2-air mixture and usually to carotid sinus stimulation.
Effect of Progressive Destruction of the Central Nervous S y s t e m . The great variability of response noted in the test animal suggested that the substance or substances with which we were dealing might depend for their action on the cooperation of some portion of the central nervous system. It was assumed that during the initial period (Period 1), the lack of response was due to a temporary paralysis of the central nervous system, caused by anesthesia, when perforce an excess of ether was ordinarily employed. The sluggish reactions again, in Period 3, suggest that a more complete paralysis had occurred.
In order therefore to determine whether the central nervous system is an essential part of the mechanism of the pressor response, anesthetized cats were pithed to the second lumbar segment through a trephine hole in the skull, after tying off both carotid arteries. These animals responded markedly and regularly to adrenalin and pitressin. Such preparations are more sensitive to peripherally acting pressor substances than those in which the central nervous system is intact, provided the artificial respiration is properly regulated.
It could be shown that no response whatever was elicited by the injection of active pressor extracts (Fig. 6) into these pithed animals.
In order to localize more precisely the portion of the nervous system involved in the pressor response, the brain was removed at various levels in anesthetized, vagotomized cats, by means of the Sherrington guillotine. The action of pressor extract was not unusual until the cut passed through the brain somewhat above the bony tentorium. At and below this level, the responsiveness of the animal was slightly increased. However, section just below the tentorium abolished all effect of extracts.
Action on Unanesthetized A nimals.--That the pharmacological action of many substances is markedly influenced by the anesthetic employed during the testing, is well known. It seemed important, therefore, to eliminate this factor as an influence in the action of the pressor extract.

IRVINE H. PAGE

For this purpose rabbits were found most satisfactory since they would lie quietly while the blood pressure was being taken. The method of Koch and Mies (53) was used to measure the blood pressure. This consists essentially in the preliminary operative transplantation of the carotid artery above the muscles of the neck of the anesthetized animal in such a way that a metal chamber containing a glass window can be clamped over the artery. One side of the chamber is covered by rubber membrane, and it is on this membrane that the artery is placed; that is, between the membrane and the glass window. Air pressure is applied against the membrane until the column of blood in the artery is just obliterated, and the pressure is then read from a mercury manometer. The transplantation of the artery was performed a day or two before the experiment. Often 0.5 cc. of 50 per cent ethyl urethane was given subcutaneously 15 minutes before the experiment in order to insure that the animal would remain quiet. By gentle handling we have had no difficulties. After applying the chamber it is well to wait 15 minutes before taking readings. A control period of 30 minutes was carried out, taking readings every 5 minutes to observe the range of spontaneous fluctuation in blood pressure. Our experience has been that most animals maintain under the conditions of the experiment a blood pressure of about 115 to 135 ram. of Hg without wide fluctuation.
Under the influence of ether, amytal, or ethyl urethane, rabbits have been found but moderately responsive to pressor extracts which
were proven highly active in cats. The intravenous injection in nonanesthetized animals (ear vein) of 5 cc. portions of extract induced
blood pressure elevation of 15 to 22 ram. of Hg. which appeared almost
immediately after injection, and lasted 3 to 8 minutes. The same
amount of normal saline produced practically no effect on the blood pressure.
This procedure has been controlled by the more usual method in which the carotid artery is cannulated and the pressure recorded graphically. The vessel was prepared, the cannula inserted under light ether anesthesia, and as soon as the operation was complete the cannula was stoppered. The animal was then allowed to recover from the anesthesia. 1 hour later blood pressure level was recorded. Records taken over 15 minute periods exhibited blood pressure of remarkable constancy. Pressor extracts ordinarily gave responses some 5 to 10 ram. of Hg greater than the same extracts tested on the same animal while anesthetized with ether.
Miscellaneous Observations Related to the Problem of Pressor Substances in Blood
UltrafiItrates of Plasma Tested on Non-Anesthetized Animals.--In view of the observation of Anselmino and Hoffmann (15-17) that

88

PRESSOR SUBSTANCES FROM BODY FLUIDS

ultrafiltrates of plasma or serum of blood from patients suffering from eclampsia, in whom the blood pressure was greater than 180 ram. of Hg, produced a rise in blood pressure of rabbits, it seemed desirable to test ultrafiltrates derived from the plasma of cases of essential and nephritic hypertension by the same method. The Koch-Mies method (53) has been used in the manner suggested by Anselmino and Hoffmann. ~
Mter the control period, during which we convinced ourselves that the blood pressure of the animal was constant, 10 cc. portions of neutralized (to phenol* phthalein) ultrafiltrate were injected subcutaneously into each flank of the animal and the injection site well massaged. Pressure readings were then taken every 5 minutes for a period of 30 minutes. Four plasma extracts from cases of essential and malignant hypertension (blood pressures ranging from 220 to 290 mm. systolic and 120 to 160 diastolic), and four cases of hemorrhagic Bright's disease with blood pressures from 195 to 250 systolic and 128 to 145 diastolic) were examined.
In no experiment was any effect on the blood pressure of the rabbit observed. The conclusion seems justified that while the conditions were excellent for a positive outcome of the experiment, the results were uniformly negative.
Ultrafiltrates of Plasma Tested on Anesthetized Animals.--Ultrafiltrates of plasma exhibited no marked action on the blood pressure level of anesthetized cats when injected intravenously in amounts up to 20 cc. While it is possible that a small quantity of pressor substance may pass the filter membrane, the fact that almost 90 per cent of the active material may be extracted by alcohol from the nonfilterable residue, clearly indicates that the amount which is dialyzable is very small. Alteration of the pH of the plasma before ultrafiltration did not change this result.
The extract of plasma prepared by the alcohol method as contrasted with native plasma was easily passed through the filter membrane without loss of activity.
Extracts of Blood Corpuscles.--Extracts of red blood cells prepared in the same manner as plasma extracts generally depress the blood pressure level. This is not always true as rare specimens have been found which produced slight pressor action and others have had none.

120 samples of red blood cells from patients suffering from essential hypertension, hemorrhagic Bright's disease, with and without hypertension, and red cells from normal individuals, have been compared. Analysis of the many graphs so obtained reveals no effect which is characteristic for any especial group of patients. It does not, therefore, seem necessary to present the detailed data.
Extracts of blood cells which have been hemolyzed by the addition of distilled water and then added to alcohol (20 cc. red cells + 20 cc. water in 380 cc. alcohol 95 per cent) and the extract prepared in the manner described for plasma also exhibited no characteristic difference from red cells of the same blood specimen in which hemolysis had been scrupulously avoided.
The amount of depressor substance in very fresh red blood cells (in alcohol within 5 minutes of venipuncture) is ordinarily not great. Extracts which correspond to 2 cc. of centrifuged cells may depress the blood pressure level of a 3.5 kilo cat 12 to 20 ram. of mercury. Allowing corpuscles to stand before addition to alcohol longer than 2 hours may cause to be liberated most powerful depressor substances. The injection of such an extract, corresponding to 2 cc. of corpuscles, may be quickly fatal to the animal. Atropine does not alter the depressor action of these extracts.

CLINICAL RESULTS
Since it could be shown that a pressor substance was extractable from the blood of man, it was of importance to ascertain whether the amount of this substance was altered in patients suffering from hypertension regardless of the pathogenesis of the symptom.
165 experiments have been performed, and from these data it seems almost certain that there is no significant correlation between the blood pressure response in the cat and the blood pressure of the patient from whom the plasma was obtained. Sufficeit to say that the bloodof 33 normal individuals, 8 cases of latent hemorrhagic Bright's disease, 12 cases of acute hemorrhagic Bright's disease, I 1 cases of chronicactive hemorrhagic Bright's disease, 19 cases of terminal nephritis, 8 cases of nephrosis or the nephrotic stage of Bright's disease, 38 cases of essential hypertension, 11 cases of toxemia of pregnancy, 1 case of cirrhosis of the liver without hypertension, and 2 casesof severe eclampsiahave

been examined. 6 From many of these patients blood samples have been taken at intervals of a week for periods upwards of 16 months. During this time marked variations in the level of the patient's blood pressure had occurred (Fig. 7). Because of inherent difficulties in the method of assay, it was necessary to secure data which would be

statistically significant. This goal, we believe, has been achieved, and: it must be fairly stated that no correlation appears to exist between, the amount of pressor substance and the height of the blood pressure,

It has been possible to examine blood from cases7 of the recently described pituitary basophilism. Three of these cases had rather marked hypertension8 and in the other two the pressure averaged 140 to 150 mm. Hg systolic and 90 to 94 diastolic. All the patients exhibited more or less typically the signs and symptoms of this disease as set forth by Cushing. No characteristic difference was observed in the ultrafiltrates or extracts of plasma from these patients as compared with extracts of normal blood.
As an incidental observation it seems worth recording that from a limited number (3) of patients suffering from convulsive uremia extracts of blood plasma seemed peculiarly toxic when injected into a cat. Instead of the usual rise in blood pressure, a precipitous fall occurred, causing the death of the animal. It should be emphasized that these patients were in the terminal stage of hemorrhagic Bright's disease and not examples of the so called pseudo-uremia.
Cerebrospinal fluids from nineteen assorted cases of nephritic and essential hypertension have also been examined. Pressor substance is present in at least as large amounts as in plasma. Injection of fresh spinal fluid from a variety of patients suffering from hypertension failed to show the presence of any appreciable amount of free pressor substance when tested either on anesthetized animals with the central nervous system intact, or on pithed cats. The possibility that unbound secretion of the posterior pituitary body is contained in the spinal fluid in amounts which might be considered significant in the pathogenesis of hypertension, has not been demonstrated. This statement must be qualified to a certain extent in that the ventricular fluid from one case of adrenal tumor contained a powerful pressor substance with properties somewhat different from those of the pressor extracts of plasma. Spinal fluid of one patient with a severe malignant hypertension also was powerfully vaso-active.
DISCUSSION
The pressor substance evidently is widely distributed since it has been found in human plasma, ascitic and cerebrospinal fluids. Corpuscles seem to contain little or none of it because alcohol extracts

either do not influence or strongly depress the level of the blood pres-. sure of cats. That it is not free in these fluids foUows from the fact that ultrafiltration yields a protein-free filtrate which has no vasoactivity. It seems probable that the substance is bound to the plasma colloids but the union must be loose, to be split by such mild treatment as that with cold alcohol. The active substance is water-soluble and behaves not unlike an organic base.
The pharmacological properties of the pressor substance appear in some respects unique. The evidence, in the first place, gathered from comparison with drugs acting on peripheral arteries such as adrenalin, choline, histamine, and adenosine, does not lend support to the view that its action resembles that of these other substances. The effect of ergotoxine and cocaine on the response to pressor extract also demonstrates the dissimilarity in action.
The second group of data indicates that the functional intactness of the central nervous system is essential in order that pressor responses be obtained from the extract under investigation: The most cogent of these proofs consists in the demonstration that if the brain is removed close to the bony tentorium, the pressor response is undisturbed, conversely the response is completely abolished on pithing or cutting the cord below the medulla. Anesthesia, furthermore, prolonged to the point where inhalation of carbon dioxide-air mixtures or stimulation of the carotid sinus no longer elevate the blood pressure, also inhibits its action. The unanesthetized animal (rabbit) is, in fact, more responsive than the anesthetized. It is not improbable that some substance in the extract sensitizes the mechanism responsible for the carotid sinus reflex, for after injection of extract the reflex is considerably more active than before.
A third group of more miscellaneous'data indicates that the splanchnic area is actively involved in the vascular constriction. The evidence consists largely in the demonstration that evisceration strongly depresses the response and oncometric measurement of the leg and renal volume shows relatively little constriction when marked elevation of the level of pressure has occurred. Stimulation of the adrenals to secrete more epinephrin apparently plays little or no part in the mechanism because bilateral adrenalectomy does not influence the result. An assay of the potency of the extract has been difficult

93

because the degree of response depends on the functional state of the nervous system. To some degree success has been attained in predicting the response of the animal to pressor extract by relying on the reflex from the carotid sinus and on that from stimulation by carbon dioxide. No evidence has been found indicating that there is an increase in the amount of pressor substance in hypertensive states of varied pathogenesis.
This investigation was undertaken to ascertain whether, by direct methods which involve as slight chemical manipulations as possible, a single substance or a group of substances is extractable from blood which causes or is associated with arterial hypertension in man. There are numerous possibilities. Such substances, present in normal blood, may be increased in the blood of hypertensive patients; they may be present only in hypertensive states; though constant in amount, the sensitivity of the vascular system may be so increased that its response is pathological; the amount bound to plasma colloid may remain constant though the amount liberated, due to the activity
of the reacting cells (Erfolgsorgan), may be greater than normal; and,
finally, they may be set free into the blood stream and either be quickly destroyed or inactivated. While it may be necessary to" reckon with these manifold possibilities this investigation has been confined to the effort to demonstrate the presence of pressor substances in circulating blood and their quantitative aspects in relation to the hypertensive state in man.
CONCLUSIONS
1. Extracts of human blood plasma, ascltie and cerebrospinal fluids have been shown to contain a substance or substances which have a prolonged and powerful pressor action when injected into test animals.
2. The chemical properties of the substance suggest those of an organic base. It is extracted with alcohol, soluble in water and acetone, extracted from water by chloroform, and probably is but slightly heat~stable. The plasma colloids seem to hold the substance in a bound state since it does not appear in the ultrafiltrate and is liberated on coagulation of the colloids by alcohol. Coagulation alone of the blood does not cause the substance to be formed.
3. Its action suggests that its pressor effect is brought about by

94

P1ZESSOR SUBSTANCES FROM BODY leLIJIDS

mediation of the central nervous system. This inference was drawn from the following observations. (a) The functional intactness of the central nervous system is essential in order that pressor responses be obtained. Unanesthetized animals exhibit greater vascular responses than do anesthetized. (b) Pithing animals completely abolishes the response. Progressive ablation of the brain to the level of the hind brain does not alter the response, but below this level, injury abolishes the activity of the extract. (c) Some substance in the extract sensitizes the mechanism responsible for the carotid sinus reflex. (d) There is no parallelism between the response to peripherally acting drugs and pressor extracts. (e) Removal of the adrenal glands does not affect its character.
4. The rise in blood pressure appears to be due especially to constriction of the arteries in the splanchnic region.
5. Assay of the pressor extracts is made difficult because of the dependence of the vascular response on the functional state of the central nervous system. The carotid sinus reflex and stimulation with carbon dioxide-air mixtures have proved most useful means for the estimation of this functional state. It has been pointed out that the vascular responses to extract, stimulation of the carotid sinus, and inhalation of carbon dioxide-air vary greatly during the course of an experiment on anesthetized animals. This natural history of the vascular responses has been described.
6. No evidence has been produced by the method employed that the amount of this pressor substance is increased in the blood or spinal fluid of patients with hypertension of varied pathogenesis (nephritic hypertension, essential hypertension, malignant hypertension, eclampsia, and pituitary basophilism).

ABSTRACT
The 5 cap structure of eukaryotic mRNA is critical for its processing, transport, translation, and stability. The many functions of the cap and the fact that most, if not all, mRNA carries the same type of cap makes it difficult to analyze cap function in vivo at individual steps of gene expression. We have used the lariat capping ribozyme (LCrz) from the myxomycete Didymium to replace the mRNA m7G cap of a single reporter mRNA species with a tiny lariat in which the first and the third nucleotide are joined by a 2, 5 phosphodiester bond. We show that the ribozyme functions in vivo in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae presumably without cofactors and that lariat capping occurs cotranscriptionally. The lariat-capped reporter mRNA is efficiently exported to the cytoplasm where it is found to be oligoadenylated and evenly distributed. Both the oligoadenylated form and a lariat-capped mRNA with a templated poly(A) tail translates poorly, underlining the critical importance of the m7G cap in translation. Finally, the lariat-capped RNA exhibits a threefold longer half-life compared to its m7G-capped counterpart, consistent with a key role for the m7G cap in mRNA turnover. Our study emphasizes important activities of the m7G cap and suggests new utilities of lariat capping as a molecular tool in vivo.

INTRODUCTION
The m7GpppN cap structure of eukaryotic mRNA 5 ends plays a critical role in many aspects of gene expression, including mRNA splicing, polyadenylation, export, translation initiation, and overall stability (Topisirovic et al. 2011; Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis and Cowling 2014; Ramanathan et al. 2016). Given this plethora of functions, it is experimentally attractive to dissect the role of the cap in distinct cellular processes by manipulating its structure, preferably on individual mRNA. However, present strategies to this end have shortcomings. Genetic interference with cap synthesis affects all mRNA and inhibits cell growth, making it difficult to distinguish direct from indirect effects caused by the mutation. As an alternative, switching the promoter to redirect mRNA transcription from RNA polymerase (RNAP) II to RNAPIII is a possibility, but along with changed cap status, RNAPIII transcription also affects pre-mRNA splicing and 3 end formation restricting its applicability. Finally, insertion of a cis-cleaving ribozyme (Dower et al. 2004; Meaux and Van Hoof 2006), or the recognition sites for the endonucleases RNase III (Meaux et al. 2011) or RNase P, leaves the post-

cleaved 3 fragment with either a 5 OH (small ribozymes) or 5 monophosphate (RNase III or RNase P). Transcription using bacteriophage RNA polymerases creating RNA triphosphate 5 ends is also possible (Dower and Rosbash 2002). These RNA 5ends are all substrates for cellular enzymes that will result in 5-3 degradation hampering any functional studies.
We have previously described the naturally occurring lariat capping ribozyme (LCrz; formerly GIR1), that caps a homing endonuclease mRNA in several eukaryotic microorganisms, including myxomycetes and amoeboflagellates (Nielsen et al. 2008; Tang et al. 2011, 2014). LCrz cleaves in cis at an internal processing site (IPS) by branching, leaving the downstream fragment with a 5 lariat in which the first and the third nucleotide are linked by a 2, 5 phosphodiester bond (Nielsen et al. 2005; Meyer et al. 2014). This structure is referred to as a lariat cap and appears to substitute for all functions of a conventional mRNA cap in the native system (Vader et al. 1999). The ribozyme and the homing endonuclease gene are located together in a group I intron in the

SSU rRNA gene and the lariat capping mechanism is viewed as an adaptation to expression of a mRNA from within a RNAPI gene (Johansen et al. 2007).
Ribozymes can be transferred to non-native organisms and have been used as experimental tools to study RNA processing and gene expression in bacterial, fungal, and mammalian systems (Sullenger and Gilboa 2002; Long et al. 2003). LCrz is active in vitro in the absence of protein cofactors and hence likely to be transferable. LCrz has the additional advantage that the lariat cap is resistant to cellular 5-3 degradation activities when expressed ectopically. Specifically, the lariat cap is not a substrate for cellular debranching enzymes (Nielsen et al. 2005) and the particular structure of the lariat cap (Meyer et al. 2014), including the absence of an exposed 5 end, makes it unlikely to be a substrate for decapping enzymes and 5-3 exonucleases. Thus, transplantation of LCrz may be used to create stable transcripts in which the m7G cap is missing, exposing its roles in mRNA metabolic processes.
Here, we transfer LCrz to S. cerevisiae and explore its impact on the processing, localization, expression, and stability of a GFP reporter mRNA. We find that the ribozyme efficiently cleaves the precursor transcript during transcription and that the lariat-capped mRNA (LC-GFP mRNA) is efficiently exported to the cytoplasm. The LC-GFP mRNA is threefold more stable compared to a conventionally capped GFP mRNA (m7G-GFP mRNA), accumulates to high levels in an oligoadenylated form, and is translated, albeit with very low efficiency. Thus, we confirm that stabilization against degradation and stimulation of translation are the

major roles of the native cap. Understanding of lariat cap behavior in cells may reveal new aspects of gene expression and have potential for biotechnological application.
RESULTS
Production of LC-GFP mRNA in S. cerevisiae
To study the biological activity of the lariat cap in S. cerevisiae, we fused the LCrz upstream of cDNA encoding GFP and inserted the construct into the expression plasmid pG-1 (Fig. 1A). The specific version of LCrz used was "Di-166.22," meaning the ribozyme from Didymium iridis, comprising 166-nt upstream and 22-nt downstream, respectively, of the internal processing site (IPS). In pG-1, transcription is driven by the constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphor dehydrogenase (GPD) promoter and 3 end formation by the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) terminator. Three variants of the construct were made: (i) the experimental construct containing the wt LCrz (LC-GFP) and expected to produce the lariat-capped GFP mRNA; (ii) a positive control (m7G-GFP), that incorporates only the 22 nt of the ribozyme that are found downstream from the IPS and an additional 21-nt upstream of this sequence that were included for technical reasons; and (iii) a negative expression control (LCmutGFP), containing LCrz carrying a single point mutation (G174C) that is known from in vitro studies to completely inactivate the ribozyme (Decatur et al. 1995). The mRNA produced from the positive control construct (m7G-GFP

Lariat capping in yeast

mRNA) carries a conventional m7G cap and an initiation
codon in a similar sequence context as the experimental
LC-GFP constructs mRNA. The mRNA produced by the
LCmut-GFP negative control is similar to LC-GFP except that it harbors a 200-nt long 5 UTR consisting of the mutated
ribozyme sequence with multiple start codons in two reading
frames and stop codons present in all three reading frames
(Supplemental Fig. S1).
Expression of the three constructs was first studied
by Northern blotting analysis of whole cell RNA. Using a
probe targeting the GFP part of the mRNA, we observed
single bands of the expected sizes derived from both of the m7G-GFP and LCmut-GFP controls (Fig. 1B, lanes 1,7).
For the experimental LC-GFP construct (lane 4), two bands
were observed. The upper band corresponds to the precursor
transcript as deduced by its co-migration with the LCmut-
GFP control, while the lower band corresponds to the presumed 3 cleavage product as deduced by its migration close to the size of the m7G-GFP control. Hybridization with a
probe targeting the ribozyme part of the mRNA revealed the expected 5 cleavage product in the experimental lanes only (Fig. 1B, lanes 4-6). Thus, we conclude that LCrz cleaves the transcript in vivo and the 1:4 ratio of precursor to 3
cleavage product indicates that cleavage is relatively efficient.
LC-GFP mRNA levels were four- to fivefold and eight- to 10fold higher than those of the m7G-GFP and LCmut-GFP
samples, respectively, as evidenced by phosphoimager analy-
sis of the Northern blot (data not shown). Since transcription
was driven from the same promoter and RNA was isolated
from parallel cultures, this indicates that the LC-GFP mRNA is more stable than its conventionally capped m7G-
GFP mRNA counterpart.
LCrz is known from in vitro experiments to catalyze not
only the lariat capping branching reaction as described above but also hydrolytic cleavage yielding a 5-monophosphate on
the downstream fragment (Nielsen et al. 2005). Cleavage in
the native system of Didymium cells occurs exclusively by
branching (Vader et al. 1999). We carried out two different
types of analysis to distinguish between these possibilities
in the present experiment. First, we probed the nature of the 5 ends of the assayed mRNAs by enzymatic treatment, using tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) to convert 5 tri-phosphates and m7G-caps to 5 monophosphates in com-
bination with Terminator exonuclease (Ter) digesting only RNA with 5 monophosphates. RNA resulting from such
treatments was analyzed by Northern blotting hybridization. A 3 fragment derived from hydrolytic cleavage should be removed by Ter alone whereas a lariat-capped 3 fragment should be resistant. Similarly, the conventional m7G cap
should only be removed by the combined TAP/Ter treat-
ment, whereas the lariat cap again should be resistant. As
shown in Figure 1B (lanes 2,5,8), all mRNAs resisted Ter treatment. Moreover, the m7G-GFP mRNA, the LCmutGFP mRNA, the 5 end fragment derived from LCrz cleavage
and the uncleaved LC-GFP precursor transcript were all

sensitive to TAP + Ter treatment (Fig. 1B, lanes 3,6,9), as expected for m7G-capped RNAs. In contrast, the LC-GFP mRNA (Fig. 1B, lane 6, GFP Northern) survived TAP+Ter treatment, strongly indicating that its cleavage had occurred by the branching reaction. A similar conclusion was reached when we mapped the cleavage site by primer extension analysis. RNA that is cleaved by branching will result in premature primer extension stop signals because the branch acts as an efficient block to the reverse transcriptase (Nielsen et al. 2005). Consistent with the Northern result, only the stop signals corresponding to the precursor 5 end and the branch nucleotide were observed (Fig. 1C). Thus, LC-GFP mRNA is efficiently produced from our experimental construct and LCrz cleavage occurs exclusively by branching. This implies that LCrz is transferable from Didymium to yeast.
LC-GFP mRNAs are oligoadenylated at steady state
Having established that the experimental LC-GFP mRNA is lariat capped, we next analyzed its polyadenylation status by an RNase H/oligo(dT) assay (Fig. 2A). RNase H cleaves the RNA in RNA:DNA hybrids and removes the poly(A) tail in an oligo(dT)-dependent fashion, resulting in a mobility shift on Northern gels. We also used an upstream DNA oligo to shorten the interrogated RNAs and thereby increase the resolution of the assay. Figure 2B shows the Northern blotting analysis of our three transcripts with parallel samples with (+) or without (-) oligo(dT) in the RNase H reactions. For both of the control transcripts, a clear shift from diffuse signals (lanes 1,5) to distinct and faster migrating species (lanes 2,6) was observed. This demonstrates the expected polyadenylation of these m7G-capped transcripts. The LCGFP mRNA displayed both a diffuse signal and a distinct band in RNase H assays excluding oligo(dT) (lane 3), which collapsed into a single, faster migrating distinct band upon oligo(dT) addition (lane 4). We interpret the diffuse signal to derive from the uncleaved precursor transcript observed previously (Fig. 1B, lane 4) based on its co-migration with the signal in lane 5. The distinct band, on the other hand, constitutes the bulk of the signal and most likely reflects the lariat-capped mRNAs, which consequently harbor only short poly(A) tails (Fig. 2B, note the slight change in migration between lanes 3 and 4).
The absence of a long poly(A) tail on the LC-GFP mRNA could be due to deficient polyadenylation, increased deadenylation, or an unusual stability of deadenylated RNA. To gain more information on these possibilities, we expressed the m7G- and LC-GFP constructs in a strain deleted for the major cytoplasmic deadenylase Ccr4p (Tucker et al. 2001) and in a strain with an additional deletion of the Pan2p poly(A) nuclease (Brown and Sachs 1998). Using the RNase H/oligo(dT) assay, poly(A) tails of m7G-GFP mRNAs appeared considerably longer in the double ccr4pan2 mutant compared to its corresponding wt strain (compare mobility differences in lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 2B and Fig. 2C, respectively).

LC-GFP mRNAs, on the other hand, remained oligoadenylated but with slightly longer tails in ccr4 compared to wt cells (Fig. 2C, lanes 3,4). Moreover, they exhibited a wide distribution of A-tail lengths, ranging from unadenylated or containing few A-residues to tails of intermediate length in the ccr4pan2 double mutant (Fig. 2C, lanes 5,6). This is consistent with redundant deadenylation functions of Pan2p and Ccr4p and suggests that short oligo(A) tails of LC-GFP mRNAs in wt cells derive from deadenylation. Notably, the tail-lengths observed with the LC-GFP mRNA did not reach the same lengths as with m7G-GFP mRNAs in the ccr4pan2 double mutant (Fig. 2C; compare lanes 1 and 5).
To obtain a more precise estimate of poly(A) tail lengths in wt and ccr4pan2 backgrounds, we carried out a modified 3 RACE experiment based on ligation of adapters to 3 ends. The poly(A) tail lengths obtained from sequencing of individual 3 RACE clones are depicted in Figure 2D and agree well with the results in Figure 2B,C. m7G-GFP mRNAs expressed in wt cells harbored a poly(A) tail distribution of 20-60 residues with a median length of 33 compared to a median length of 27 for all mRNAs obtained from a transcriptome-wide sequencing-based characterization (Subtelny et al. 2014). Tails of the few clones obtained from the double mutant background had a median length of 65. As expected,

LC-GFP mRNA poly(A) tail lengths in wt cells fell in two statistically separable groups: one with a median length of 31, probably representing the precursor transcripts, and another with a median length of 10 (range 5-20), representing the processed mRNA equipped with a lariat cap (Fig. 2D). Finally, the LC-GFP mRNA expressed in ccr4pan2 cells exhibited a wide distribution (range 15-71) with a median length of 41. This is consistent with the result from the Northern blot (Fig. 2C, lane 5) and suggests that lariat capping affects the formation of the poly(A) tail in complex ways. Although the oligoadenylated status of the LC-GFP mRNA is eventually the result of redundant deadenylation by Ccr4p and Pan2p, an effect on the initial polyadenylation cannot be ruled out.
LCrz cleaves nascent RNA
To get an idea of the cap status of LC-GFP mRNAs at the time of their 3 end processing, we analyzed whether cleavage by LCrz might occur cotranscriptionally. To this end, we made chromatin preparations of strains expressing LCGFP- and LCmut GFP mRNA, respectively, and isolated RNA according to a protocol previously used to characterize nascent RNA (Carrillo Oesterreich et al. 2010). These RNA

686 RNA, Vol. 23, No. 5

preparations contained <4% mature ribosomal RNA and were highly enriched in rRNA precursor and processing intermediate transcripts (Supplemental Fig. S2A,B). Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis showed that unadenylated actin mRNA was enriched more than fivefold in this fraction (Supplemental Fig. S2C). For analysis of GFP reporter constructs we used three different primer sets: (i) one directed toward the LCrz part, (ii) one spanning its cleavage site, and (iii) one directed toward the GFP RNA part (Fig. 2E, amplicons a, b, and c, respectively), and calculated qRTPCR ratios between experiments with active and inactive LCrz constructs. If LCrz cleaves exclusively after completion of transcription, the ratio of LC-GFP- to LCmut-GFP RNA in the chromatin fraction would expectedly be the same when using all three primer sets. On the other hand, if cleavage occurs cotranscriptionally, qRT-PCR ratios should be lower using the two first primer sets due to uncoupling of 5- and 3-end fragments upon cleavage. Indeed, a twofold lower ratio was observed for amplicons a and b compared to c (Fig. 2F), indicating that LCrz cleaves a substantial fraction of transcripts cotranscriptionally. A similar observation was made with a di-cistronic construct with two open reading frames separated by the same LCrz version (data not shown). We favor the notion that LCrz cleavage occurs prior to RNA 3end cleavage at the poly(A) site. First, the enrichment of unadenylated actin transcripts in the same RNA preparations (Supplemental Fig. S2C) suggests that nascent rather than 3 processed transcripts are assayed. Second, an RNAPII transcription rate of 30 nt/sec (Mason and Struhl 2005) would allow more than half a minute for the fully transcribed LCrz-containing RNA to fold and cleave. Theoretically, this is ample time considering the fast cotranscriptional folding and cleavage rates observed with ribozymes in vivo (Lai et al. 2013). Thus, we propose that LCrz cleaves nascent transcripts and thus effectively removes the m7G cap and the cap-binding complex from the transcribing polymerase.
LC-GFP mRNAs undergo nuclear export
In lariat capping, the transcript diverges from the usual coordinated and cotranscriptional series of processing events that lead to the formation of the mature mRNP and its export. Thus, it could be envisaged that the loss of cap/CBC connectivity would interfere with the export of the LC-GFP mRNA. On the other hand, several reports in budding yeast have shown that cap-less 3 fragments of transcripts that are produced by bacteriophage polymerases, cleaved by ribozymes or RNaseIII in the nucleus are subsequently found in the cytoplasm (Dower and Rosbash 2002; Meaux and Van Hoof 2006; Meaux et al. 2011). We therefore next determined the cellular localization of the LC-GFP mRNA by a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) experiment with probes targeting the LCrz upstream of the cleavage site and the downstream GFP parts of the mRNA, respectively. Note, that the experiment is complicated by the presence of

20% of uncleaved precursor LC-GFP mRNA (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we analyzed in parallel the cellular localization of the LCmut-GFP control transcript that differs from the LC-GFP precursor by only a single internal nucleotide in the ribozyme part and thus is expected to behave similarly to the precursor in the FISH experiment. The m7G-GFP mRNA showed the expected predominant cytoplasmic signal when using the GFP probe (Fig. 3A, top row) and no staining with the LCrz probe (Fig. 3B, top row). When expressing the LCmut-GFP transcript, the two probes both yielded staining patterns with most cells showing several highly localized and intense signals in the nucleus and a very faint and diffuse signal in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A,B, bottom rows). The nuclear signals may represent retention of transcripts at chromatin, perhaps at the sites of transcription from the high-copynumber plasmids. The faintness of the cytoplasmic signal is consistent with the expectation that these transcripts are NMD-substrates based on the multiple start and stop signals in the LCrz part of their 5 UTRs (Supplemental Fig. S1).

Krogh et al.

Finally, cells expressing the LC-GFP mRNA and hybridized with the GFP probe displayed a faint nuclear signal and a strong, diffuse cytoplasmic signal (Fig. 3A, middle row). Hybridization with the LCrz probe (Fig. 3B, middle row), on the other hand, yielded a staining pattern similar to that of the LCmut-GFP construct, suggesting a large contribution to the signal from the 20% uncleaved precursor. Together, these experiments suggest that the LC-GFP transcript is cleaved in the nucleus and that the 3 GFP mRNA is exported in its lariat-capped form. We therefore conclude that the lariat-capped mRNAs are exported efficiently to the cytoplasm.
LC-GFP mRNAs are inefficiently translated
Translation of yeast mRNA depends on both its cap and poly(A) tail. Thus, lariat-capped mRNAs with no conventional cap and with only oligoadenylated tails might be compromised in translation. To address this, we performed GFP fluorescence microscopy (Supplemental Fig. S3A) and flow cytometry (Supplemental Fig. S3B) of cells expressing LC-GFP mRNA and compared them to the m7G-GFP and LCmut-GFP controls. Cells harboring the m7G-GFP mRNA were brightly fluorescent in contrast to cells harboring the LCmut-GFP mRNA, which yielded only background autofluorescence. This was also the case for cells harboring a construct having a different ribozyme inactivating mutation (A153G; not shown). Cells expressing LC-GFP mRNA were clearly more fluorescent than the LCmut-GFP control but at levels that were much below that of the m7G-GFP control. Given the high cellular levels of LC-GFP mRNA (Figs. 1B, 3B), this implies that the lariat-capped and oligoadenylated mRNA is inefficiently translated. This conclusion was supported by flow cytometry analysis, which showed that cells expressing LC-GFP mRNA exhibit GFP fluorescence at 1% of cells expressing m7G-GFP mRNA yet are separable from the background fluorescence of cells expressing LCmut-GFP mRNA (Supplemental Fig. S2B).
In order to isolate the effect of the lariat cap substitution from that of the short oligo(A) tail, we introduced a templated poly(A) tail of 50 nt into the construct. The encoded poly(A) tail was released as part of the mRNA by cleavage using a cotranscribed HDV ribozyme designed to cleave after the last A in the template poly(A) tail and leave a cyclic phosphate end upon cleavage. Because the basic construct relied on polyadenylation within the PGK terminator that is known to harbor several alternative poly(A) sites, we initially made the construct with deletions from the major poly(A) site and upstream into the 3 UTR. Thus, we tested constructs with full, short, middle length, and long 3 UTRs, respectively, all with an abrogated major poly(A) site (Fig. 4A). All constructs produced mRNAs of the expected length with approximately the same levels of precursor and lariat-capped products as the construct with the original 3 UTR (Fig. 4B, top panel). The functionality of the LC and HDV ribozymes was evidenced by detection of the released ribozymes by

Northern blotting analysis (Fig. 4B, middle panels) and the complete absence of HDV extended precursors (data not shown). The absence of a hybridization signal with the HDV probe on the RNA from the construct with a full-length 3 UTR (Fig. 4B, second panel, lane 3) suggests that a minor poly(A) site upstream HDV was used in this case. Next, we validated the presence of the poly(A) tail on the lariat-capped mRNA with the longest 3 UTR using the RNase H assay outlined in Figure 2 (Fig. 4C, lanes 1 and 2). This analysis revealed two populations of tails in roughly equal proportions; short tails of variable length as observed with normal polyadenylation, and tails with a defined length consistent with the templated poly(A) tail. A control experiment that removed the precursor transcripts by decapping and 5 exonuclease treatment prior to the RNase H assay ruled out that the long tails derived from conventionally capped transcripts (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 4). The construct was further analyzed by the RNase H assay in a ccr4pan2 background in which the signal representing short tails was absent (Fig. 4D). Thus, we conclude that Pan2p and Ccr4p contribute to the deadenylation of the templated poly(A) tail.
Translation of GFP was monitored by flow cytometry (Fig. 4E, upper part) and the expression of the GFP protein validated by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 4E, lower part). For unknown reasons, the construct with the shortest 3 UTR did not express GFP. All other constructs with templated poly(A) tails showed fluorescence and GFP protein levels only slightly above that of the LCGFP construct that produced mRNA with oligoadenylated tails. However, the fluorescence was two orders of magnitude less than with the construct producing conventionally capped and polyadenylated mRNA, and we therefore conclude that lariat-capped mRNAs are translated, albeit at low levels, and that the presence of a templated poly(A) tail has little impact on translation in the absence of a conventional cap.
LC-GFP mRNAs exhibit long half-lives
Cap substitution by lariat capping is presumably a stabilizing modification of mRNA because decapping followed by 5-3 decay is the predominant cytoplasmic degradation pathway and because much of the 3-5 degradation is dependent on translation competence and thus also indirectly involves the m7G cap (Harigaya and Parker 2012). In addition, the lariat cap is resistant in vitro to yeast debranching enzyme (Nielsen et al. 2005) and the Xrn1p 5-3 exonuclease (Fig. 1B; the Ter exonuclease is based on Xrn1p). Conversely, we also considered that the poor translation could stimulate degradation of LC-GFP mRNA. We addressed these questions by estimating the half-life of lariat-capped mRNA. To do this, GFP encoding reporters were placed in a vector where the GAL1 promoter drives transcription initiation. mRNA half-lives can then be estimated via Northern blotting analysis of the relevant GFP mRNA at different time points

after suppression of transcription by addition of glucose to the medium. In these experiments, we did not observe precursor transcripts, suggesting that full cleavage by LCrz is obtainable from this construct. The experiments revealed an approximately threefold increase in half-life of the LC-GFP mRNA as compared to the m7G-GFP mRNA (Fig. 5A, upper and middle panels; quantified in Fig. 5B). Importantly, the comparison concerns mRNAs that are predominantly found in the cytoplasm with similarly even distributions (Fig. 3). The addition of a templated poly(A) tail presumably terminating with a 2, 3 cyclic phosphate resulting from HDV ribozyme cleavage, did not affect the half-life of the LC-GFP mRNA (Fig. 5A, bottom panel and Fig. 5B). The m7G-capped LCmut-GFP mRNA was almost twofold less stable than the m7G-GFP mRNA and fivefold less stable than the LC-GFP mRNA (Fig. 5A, third panel and Fig. 5B), possibly explaining the steady-state expression levels of the different constructs (Fig. 1B). We conclude that lariat capping of mRNA in yeast results in a significantly increased cytoplasmic stability.

DISCUSSION
Lariat capping in yeast cells
We have expressed a GFP reporter mRNA fused to a lariat capping ribozyme and find that lariat-capped and oligoadenylated GFP mRNA is expressed abundantly in the cytoplasm where it is translated at very low levels. Thus, we have demonstrated successful transfer of LCrz from the myxomycete Didymium to yeast. This furthermore rules out an absolute requirement for native cofactors for LCrz function in a cellular environment. It is generally observed that both small cleavage ribozymes, such as the hammerhead (Meaux and Van Hoof 2006; Fong et al. 2009), and HDV ribozymes (Fong et al. 2009), group I (Shin et al. 2004), and group II (Jones et al. 2005) splicing ribozymes retain activity when transferred to other cells and organisms.

during transcription and is activated at a later stage by a conformational switching mechanism (Nielsen et al. 2008, 2009). In the present construct, essential parts of the inactive conformation have been deleted to promote direct folding into the active conformation. Consistent with this, we observe by analysis of chromatin-associated transcripts that a significant fraction is cleaved during transcription. Even so, the presence of the full-length precursor transcript in the Northern blotting analysis shows that at least a fraction of transcription results in uncleaved transcripts. Based on our experience with LCrz in vitro, we speculate that these are misfolded transcripts that remain uncleaved due to a large energy barrier for refolding into the active conformation. The absence of uncleaved precursors in the half-life experiments, in which a different promoter was used, suggests that full lariat capping is readily attainable. Cotranscriptional cleavage has also been observed with the hammerhead (Meaux and Van Hoof 2006; Fong et al. 2009) and HDV ribozymes (Fong et al. 2009). We conclude that the LCrz in the format used in the present constructs is well accommodated to the gene expression environment in yeast. A previous paper used several variants of LCrz for expression of a homing

Lariat capping and pre-mRNA 3 processing and polyadenylation
The cap structure binds the cap-binding complex (CBC), which recruits factors involved in processing of the nascent transcript (for review, see Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis and Cowling 2014). The cotranscriptional cleavage by the LCrz implies that the connection between the cap and the transcribing polymerase through the nascent RNA strand is lost and this potentially could influence downstream processing events. One of the key processing events is 3 end cleavage and subsequent polyadenylation of the mRNA. Although it is clear that a substantial fraction of the transcripts are cleaved cotranscriptionally, the timing of the branching reaction is not known. We observe that 3 processing and polyadenylation in the LC-GFP mRNA occurs at the same site as with m7G-GFP mRNA and conclude that the loss of the cap and its associated factors does not interfere with 3 end processing in the present context. In contrast, it is less clear if lariat capping interferes with polyadenylation. In the double ccr4pan2 mutant, a small fraction of the LC-GFP transcripts appear to have no A-residues added, and the bulk has shorter tails than with the m7G-GFP mRNA. This could reflect a defect in polyadenylation or the action of an additional 3-5 deadenylase that engages the lariat-capped transcript more efficiently than the conventionally capped transcript. Although there is no evidence for such an exonuclease, candidates exist (e.g., Ngl3p) (Feddersen et al. 2012). Evidence for cap-dependent defects in polyadenylation are scarce (Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis and Cowling 2014 and references herein). An example is that depletion of CBC proteins in HeLa cell nuclear extracts resulted in shorter poly(A) tails upon addition of untailed mRNA substrates (Flaherty et al. 1997). Overall, lariat capping does not seriously interfere with the functional aspects of polyadenylation in the nucleus as evidenced by nuclear stability and efficient export of the LC-GFP mRNA.
Export and localization
Fully matured and packaged mRNPs in yeast are released from the site of transcription and exported upon association with the heterodimeric Mex67-Mtr2 export receptor (for review, see Nino et al. 2013). The export receptor does not bind directly to the mRNA but via export adaptors. The mRNA cap and poly(A) tail does not play a critical role in export although the poly(A) binding proteins Pab1 and Nab2 have both been attributed mRNA export adaptor functions (Hector et al. 2002; Dunn et al. 2005; Iglesias et al. 2010). More specifically, analyses of conditional mutations in the cap guanylation enzyme (ceg1-ts) (Fresco and Buratowski

690 RNA, Vol. 23, No. 5

Lariat capping in yeast

1996) and the cap methyltransferease (abd1-ts) (Schwer et al. 2000), demonstrate that there is no accumulation of poly(A) RNA in the nucleus in cap-deficient cells arguing that the m7G cap is not required for mRNA export in yeast.
Uncleaved LC-GFP pre-mRNA and the LCmut-GFP mRNA both carry an m7G cap and appear to be retained in the nucleus for unknown reasons. In contrast, the main fraction of LC-GFP mRNA is cleaved and exported with a lariat cap. Thus, the initially added poly(A) tail may help facilitate the export of LC-GFP mRNA. However, it cannot be ruled out that an alternative export pathway is being used or that the export system is leaky. There are several reports demonstrating efficient translocation of the cap-less 3 cleavage fragment resulting from ribozyme (5OH) or Rnt1p (5 P) cleavage (Dower et al. 2004; Meaux and Van Hoof 2006; Meaux et al. 2011), and T7 polymerase transcribed GFP mRNA in yeast carrying a triphosphate 5 end is cleaved, polyadenylated, and exported to the cytoplasm (Dower and Rosbash 2002). Of particular interest, an m7G capped and hammerhead ribozyme terminated transcript was rescued for Pab1p association and nuclear export by addition of a transcribed poly(A) tail (Dower et al. 2004) demonstrating the relative importance of the poly(A) tail compared to the m7G cap for export. Thus, we conclude that the lariat cap is compatible with efficient nuclear export. Once translocated, the LCGFP mRNA appears to be distributed similarly in the cytoplasm to the m7G-GFP mRNA, that is, relatively evenly and far from the punctuate distribution seen for, e.g., P-bodies.
Translation and mRNA turnover
The LC-GFP mRNA is expressed at a level comparable to endogenous actin mRNA (data not shown). This is roughly threefold higher than that of the m7G-GFP mRNA, yet the GFP protein level as evidenced by GFP fluorescence is <1% of GFP protein in the control strain. In yeast, the cap and the poly(A) tail both stimulate translation, and optimal translation requires the presence of both (Meaux and Van Hoof 2006). The inefficient translation of LC-GFP mRNA could be due to the absence of an m7G cap or to the short oligo (A) tail, or a combination of both. However, introduction of a templated poly(A) tail that could be detected on roughly half of the transcripts had only very minor effects on translation of the LC-GFP mRNA. It has previously been shown that templated poly(A) tails restore Pab1p association to normal levels (Dower et al. 2004), and we therefore conclude that the poly(A) tail by itself contributes marginally to translation. It has previously been shown that the poly(A) tail contributes to 40S recruitment and that capless and polyadenylated mRNAs are translated in yeast extracts (Tarun and Sachs 1995; Preiss and Hentze 1998) and to a lesser degree in spheroblasts (Gallie 1991; Preiss and Hentze 1998). The differences to the situation with LC-GFP mRNA having a templated poly(A) tail could be due to experimental design, in particular the structure of the mRNA, or that our experiments better

reflect the in vivo situation due to the minimal perturbation of the cells. The critical dependence of translation on the presence of the m7G was expected because failure to methylate the 5 end guanylate of mRNA at the restrictive temperature in a temperature-sensitive mutant of the cap methyltransferase (abd1-ts) resulted in complete shutdown of protein synthesis without massive reduction in steady-state mRNA levels (Schwer et al. 2000).
In yeast, the major mRNA decay pathway consists of deadenylation followed by decapping and 5-3 degradation, whereas 3-5 degradation by the cytoplasmic exosome appears to be a minor pathway. As outlined above, the poly(A) tails of the lariat-capped mRNAs are eventually shortened into oligo(A) tails by the redundant action of Ccr4p and Pan2p. Once the transcript contains around 10 A residues, the lariat cap appears to provide an efficient block to the decapping step of the major decay pathway. Hence, further decay of the LC-GFP mRNA is most likely due to 3-5 degradation by the RNA exosome. Importantly, turnover of lariat-capped mRNA initiates at the normal deadenylation pathway followed by a block resulting in relative stabilization of the transcript. In contrast, failure to guanylate the mRNA 5 end by interference with the cap guanylation enzyme results in accelerated decay by the 5 exonuclease Xrn1 as evidenced by analysis of ceg1-ts mutants (Schwer et al. 1998). Usage of LCrz constructs may therefore provide a new tool to study decay by the cytoplasmic exosome. For example, it will be of interest to dissect if the cap is directly involved in recruitment of the exosome as has been shown for the nuclear mammalian exosome (Andersen et al. 2013). The switch in degradation pathway from the major pathway to exosomal degradation may be the cause of the observed approximately threefold increase in mRNA half-life. Based on the higher steady-state levels of templated compared to untemplated tails, the removal of the 2, 3 cyclic phosphate appeared to constitute an additional rate-limiting step in deadenylation. However, this did not result in a detectably increased halflife of the mRNA. The fate of the trinucleotide lariat cap structure upon degradation of the LC-GFP mRNA is unknown.
Applications of lariat capping
Lariat capping effectively uncouples the normal m7G cap and associated proteins from the remainder of the mRNP in individual transcript species at conditions where cell growth and morphology appear unaffected. We propose that this provides an experimental tool relevant for different types of studies. First, lariat capping can be used in combination with genetic analysis to dissect the function of the m7G cap in key cellular processes, examples of which have been demonstrated here. Second, the expression of stable, lariatcapped mRNA with very low translation competence offers at least two applications. These mRNAs could be used to screen for sequence elements that stimulate translation in a cap-independent fashion (Gilbert et al. 2007; Reineke and

Krogh et al.

Merrick 2009) upon insertion into the 5 UTR of the mRNA. With the recent discovery of an abundance of di-cistronic transcripts in yeast (Pelechano et al. 2013), many new candidates for such elements might appear. As a screening system for IRES functions, the lariat cap has the advantage compared to conventional di-cistronic reporter systems of excluding the possibility of translational read-through. A second application would be to use the lariat-capped mRNAs as competitors for binding of factors to endogenous mRNAs. Here, it is an advantage, that sequence-identical and lariat-capped versions of any mRNA can readily be designed and expressed. We envisage that such LC-mRNAs could act as decoy targets with minimal effects on other mRNAs and thereby provide important information about the effects of interference with individual mRNA species.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids, oligos, and yeast strains
Plasmids, oligos, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in the present study are listed in Supplemental Tables S1, S2, and S3, respectively. The constructs shown in Figure 1A were generated by inserting a fusion of the lariat capping ribozyme Di-166.22 (LCrz) with a GFP reporter gene in the yeast expression vector pG-1 (Guthrie and Fink 2004) using BamHI and SalI/XhoI restriction sites. The insert of the LC GFP HDV full construct shown in Figure 4A was synthesized by GenScript and inserted in the pG-1 vector using same restriction sites as above. The three constructs harboring different lengths of the 3 UTR were derived from the synthesized insert by PCR amplification using forward primer C1299 and reverse primers C1337, C1338, C1339 for LC GFP HDV-short, -middle, and -long, respectively. The sequences of all the inserts are listed in Supplemental Table S4. The constructs for the halflife experiments were generated by amplifying the relevant inserts from pG-1 constructs using primers C868 and C869 and inserting the amplified PCR products in a pESC-TRP expression vector (Agilent Technologies part number 217453-51) with a GAL1 promoter using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites.
Growth and transfection
Transformation of yeast strains was performed using LiAc competent cells and salmon sperm DNA as carriers. In brief, 5 mL of cells (OD600 below 0.6) grown in YPD medium at 30°C with shaking at 180 rpm were collected, washed in 1× LTE (0.1 M LiAc, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), resuspended in 60 µL 1× LTE and added to a mixture containing 10 µL of denatured salmon sperm DNA (10 µg/µL), 2 µL of plasmid DNA (250 ng/µL), 60 µL 5× LTE and 240 µL 50% PEG3340. The cells were incubated at 30°C for 30 min followed by a 13 min heat shock at 42°C. Then, the cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 200 µL sterile H2O and plated on selection plates. Transformed yeast cells were grown overnight in synthetic dropout medium depleted for tryptophan (SC-Trp medium, Sigma-Aldrich Y1876), diluted the following day and harvested at OD600 = 0.7-1.0 depending on the downstream analysis.

RNA extraction and nascent RNA preparation
Whole cell RNA was extracted using hot phenol. In brief, fresh cell pellets were incubated in 1 volume of TES buffer (10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and 1 volume acidic phenol (pH 4.5) at 65°C with shaking for 1 h. The RNA was extracted twice in phenol and twice in chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. Chromatin for nascent RNA preparation was extracted according to Carrillo Oesterreich et al. (2010). The chromatin pellet was resuspended in 1× DNase I buffer, incubated with 5 U of DNase I (Fermentas) for 30 min at 37°C and subsequently for 1 h at 37°C after addition of 2 µL of Proteinase K (20 mg/mL) (Fermentas). The nascent RNA preparation was extracted twice in acid phenol and twice in chloroform, followed by incubation with 2 U of DNase I for 20 min at 37°C to remove any trace of DNA. The quality of the nascent RNA was assessed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer, and the RNA was subsequently validated for the content of nascent RNA by comparing the ratios between precursor-specific amplicons and 18S rRNA amplicons in chromatin-associated and whole cell RNA, as well as comparing the ratio of actin mRNA made from cDNA synthesized with either d(T)or oligo dN6 primers between chromatin-associated RNA and whole cell RNA. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with either dN6 or oligo d(T) primers using Superscript III (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer. The cDNA was diluted 50× and used for qPCR analysis on a LightCycler Nano System (Roche) using FastStart Essential DNA Green Master reaction mixture according to the manufacturer.
5 end probing by TAP (Cap-Clip)/Terminator treatment and Northern blotting analysis
Aliquots of whole cell RNA (10 µg) were treated in parallel with or without enzyme. For TAP treatment the RNA was incubated with 5 U of Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (Epicentre) according to the manufacturer. Subsequently, the RNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (PCI) and ethanol precipitated, resuspended in DEPC H2O, and then incubated with 1 U of Terminator 5-phosphate-dependent exonuclease (Epicentre) at 30°C for 60 min. The RNA was then separated by gel electrophoresis on a 1% denaturing agarose gel. The integrity of the RNA was assessed by ethidium bromide staining and the RNA subsequently transferred to a positive charged nylon membrane (BrightStarPlus, Ambion), using the capillary blotting method, followed by UV cross-linking. The probes (10 pmol each) were labeled with [-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas) and hybridized to the membrane in hybridization buffer (4× Denhardts solution, 6× SSC, 0.1% SDS). The membrane was then washed four times in washing buffer (3× SSC, 0.1% SDS) and exposed to a Phosphor Imager Screen and analyzed by ImageQuant software. During the project TAP was discontinued by Epicentre and the TAP enzyme was replaced with Cap-Clip Acid Pyrophosphatase (CellScript) and used according to the manufacturer.
Primer extension analysis
Whole cell RNA (1 µg) was incubated in 6 µL 1× RevertAid reverse transcriptase buffer (Thermo Scientific) containing 1 pmol of oligo C723 (labeled with [-32P]ATP) at 90°C for 1 min, followed by incubation at 42°C for 10 min. The mixture was added to a 4 µL

solution consisting of 0.5 mM dNTP, 1× RevertAid RT buffer, and 40 U of RevertAid RT and further incubated at 42°C for 30 min. The sequencing ladder was made by sequencing 400 ng of plasmid DNA (GPDp-LCwt GFP) with 1 pmol of radiolabeled oligo C723 using the Thermo Sequenase Cycle sequencing Kit (USB) according to the manufacturer. The primer extension reaction and the sequencing ladder were run on an 8% polyacrylamide/50% urea gel.

Image manipulations were performed using ImageJ software.

RNase H assay for poly(A) tail analysis
Whole cell RNA (5 µg) was incubated in 1× RNase H buffer with 2.5 U of RNase H (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37°C in the presence of 25 pmol oligo C1021 with or without 225 pmol of oligod(T) NN. Subsequently, the RNA was separated on an 8% polyacrylamide/50% urea gel, transferred to a membrane by electroblotting, UV cross-linked, and a radiolabeled oligo probe (C1022) was hybridized to the membrane as described above.
3 RACE and sequencing for poly(A) tail length analysis
One hundred picomoles of an RNA oligo (CR22b) with 5 monophosphate and 3ddC ends was ligated to 2 µg of whole cell RNA in a 10 µL 1× T4 RNA ligase I buffer (NEB) supplemented with 1 mM ATP, 1 mM hexamine cobalt chloride, 20% PEG8000, and 10 U of T4 RNA ligase I (NEB). The mixture was incubated at 16°C overnight followed by the addition of 40 µL 1× TE buffer and 150 µL DEPC H2O. Then, the RNA was extracted with PCI and ethanol precipitated in the presence of 5 µg glycogen and resuspended in DEPC H2O followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis with 25 pmol DNA oligo (C959) using Superscript III (Life Technologies). The cDNA synthesis was performed at 50°C for 1 h followed by incubation with 2.5 U of RNase H for 20 min at 37°C. cDNA (1 µL) was amplified by PCR with oligos C1031 and C959 using Taq polymerase (Fermentas) in the presence of 3 mM MgCl2. The 3RACE products generated by the PCR were cloned into pCR-4 TOPO TA vector using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Life Technologies) and transfected into E. coli DH5. Colony PCR using Taq polymerase (Fermentas) with oligos C1031 and C959 was performed on single colonies, and 1 µL of the PCR products were subsequently treated with 5 U of Exonuclease I and 0.25 U of FastAP (Thermo Scientific) prior to sequencing with C1031 using the BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit according to the manufacturer. The sequencing reactions were analyzed on an ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer, and data handling was performed using Sequencing Analysis 5.2 software (Applied Biosystems). The sequences were aligned using the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor.
FISH analysis of mRNA localization
The protocol for FISH analysis was according to Schmid et al. (2015). Briefly, cells were fixed in 3.8% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, washed twice, resuspended in 1.2 M sorbitol/0.1 M K2HPO4 and adhered to poly-L-lysine treated 14-well slides (Immuno-Cell Int.) using mounting solution containing DAPI (Life Technologies). RNAs were detected using a mixture of Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probes (T represents amino-allyl-C6 modified dT): ATTAAGTG TTCAACCCGATTGCATCATGGTGATTAGCCATGATACTTC, GTTAGGACGGATGTTACGGGATCGTCCCCCACCGTTTT

Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry
Cells were washed twice and resuspended in 1× PBS. For microscopy, cells were mounted on glass slides, and GFP was detected using a Leica DM 4000B microscopy equipped with a Leica DC300FX digital camera. Cells for flow cytometry were diluted in 1× PBS to a concentration of 103 cells per µL. 5 × 104 cells were counted in a gating excluding cell debris and dead cells on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer equipped with CFlow sampler analysis software using fast sampling rate mode, with FSC-H threshold of 40,000 and 530/30 nm filter.
Western blotting analysis
Yeast culture (3 mL) (OD600 = 0.7) was collected by centrifugation at 3000g for 1 min, then washed in 200 µL sterile H2O followed by incubation in 200 µL of 0.1 M NaOH for 5 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were collected and resuspended in 40 µL of 1× SDS (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.5% SDS, 0.002% bromophenol blue, 0.7135 M (5%) -mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and lysed by incubation for 5 min at 95°C. Cell debris was collected by centrifugation at 10,000g for 3 min, and 25 µL of the cell lysate was loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE and separated for 2 h at 110 V. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Bioscience) in 1× NuPAGE Transfer buffer supplemented with 10% ethanol for 55 min at 50 V (XCell II Blot Module, Life Technologies). Unoccupied membrane binding sites were subsequently blocked for 60 min in Tris-buffered saline supplemented 0.1% Tween 20 (P1379, Sigma-Aldrich) (TBST) and 5% skim milk powder (70166, Sigma-Aldrich). The membrane was subsequently washed three times in TBST and incubated at 4°C for 24 h with primary antibodies diluted in TBST supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin (A4503, Sigma-Aldrich). For GFP, mouse anti-GFP antibody was used (8371-2, Clontech) in a 1:2000 dilution. For GAPDH, rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody (Ab9485, Abcam) was used in a 1:5000 dilution. The membrane was washed, and proteins visualized following 60 min incubation at room temperature with secondary HRP-rabbit anti-mouse Ig (for GFP) (P0260, Dako) and secondary HRP-swine anti-rabbit Ig (for GAPDH) (P0399, Dako) using ECL technology (RPN2232, Amersham Biosciences).
mRNA half-life measurements
For half-life experiments, the GFP mRNA was expressed from a GAL1 promoter in a pESC-TRP expression vector. Yeast cells grown in SCTrp medium supplemented with 2% galactose (Sigma-Aldrich G0750) were collected at OD600 = 0.4, resuspended in 30°C warm SC-Trp medium, and immediately supplemented with glucose to a final concentration of 2% (equal to time point 0 min). Samples taken at each time point were snap cooled to 0°C in liquid nitrogen, collected by centrifugation followed by removal of the medium, and pellets

Abstract: The antagonists of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) are increasingly being used in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Several adverse effects of these drugs have been reported, including the paradoxical development of sarcoidosis, especially with the use of etanercept. We present the first Brazilian case report of systemic sarcoidosis induced by etanercept and a literature review. Keywords: Diagnosis; Granuloma; Sarcoidosis; Tumor necrosis factor-alpha

Efeitos adversos desses medicamentos vem sendo relatados, incluindo o desenvolvimento paradoxal de sarcoidose, principalmente com o uso do etanercepte. Apresentamos o primeiro relato de caso brasileiro de sarcoidose sistêmica induzida por etanercepte e uma revisão da literatura.

BACKGROUND Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of
unknown etiology, characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas, especially in the lungs, lymphnodes, eyes and skin. 1 Tumor necrosis factor antagonists (anti-TNF) may be used as treatment, however some cases of sarcoidosis secondary to these same drugs have been detected.1-8 We report the case of a female patient, with rheumatoid arthritis presenting with systemic sarcoidosis after 6 months of treatment with etanercept.
CASE REPORT A fifty year-old female patient, Caucasian, born
in Rio de Janeiro, was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 10 years ago. She started treatment with weekly etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously over one year ago, due to a poor therapeutic response to methotrexate, sulphasalazine and corticoids. Prior to

starting the immunobiologic therapy, the patient was screened with thoracic radiographies, PPD and HIV and hepatitis serologic tests, all with normal results.
After 6 months of treatment with etanercept, infiltrated erythematous lesions appeared surrounding a scar on the posterior region of the right thigh and right gluteal area, followed by the emergence of painful erythematous nodules on lower limbs and an increase of volume on the neck (Figures 1 and 2). Our patient denied fever, weight loss and dyspnea. At this point, thoracic and cervical computerized tomography scans were performed, showing pulmonary perihilar lymphadenomegaly and bilateral augmentation of parotids without lymphadenomegaly, respectively (Figure 3). Histopathological examination of the right thigh skin lesion demonstrated the presence of noncaseating granulomas formed by histiocytes and giant cells in the dermis and hypodermis (Figures 4 and 5).

Etanercept was suspended after the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, and treatment with prednisone 30mg/day p.o. was initiated resulting in an improvement of skin, cervical and pulmonary lesions within approximately 30 days.
The dose of prednisone was gradually reduced after 3 months, and no relapse of symptoms was observed after 6 months of follow-up.
DISCUSSION The exact etiology of sarcoidosis remains
unknown. It is believed that an exacerbated immune response may occur due to antigenic stimuli such as infectious and environmental agents and also autoantigens.1

Systemic sarcoidosis induced by etanercept: first Brazilian case report

199

Recent studies demonstrated that TNF-  has a crucial role in forming the inflammatory granuloma, as well as in regulating adhesion molecules, recruiting cells and activating lymphocytes.9
The formation of the granuloma requires a cellular type (Th1) response pattern; involving macrophages and T CD4 activated lymphocytes. Interleukin-1b and gamma-interferon are important promoters during the initial phases of the granuloma development; TNF-  on the other hand, is critical during the latter phases of the granulomatous process.10
Tumor necrosis factor antagonists (anti-TNF) are used to treat sarcoidosis since; in theory, they would block this cytokine's action.1,2,3 However, paradoxically, some cases of sarcoidosis induced by these same medications have been reported.8 This perplexing mechanism is not yet clear, but it is believed that these drugs do not inhibit all the signaling pathways of TNF- , thus ensuing some "escape" routes.2-8
In a review published on May 2012, (Cathcart, et al6), 34 cases of sarcoidosis induced by TNF-  antagonists had already been described on the medical literature. Twenty-one of those (61.7%) occurred after the use of etanercept, 9 (26.4%) after infliximab and 4 (11.7%) after adalimumab. In this study, the mean time for the appearance of granulomas was 22 months after the start of medications.6
After a literature review, we found 48 case reports of sarcoidosis induced by TNF-  antagonists. Thirty- one (64.58%) followed etanercept, 9 (18.75%)

occurred after infliximab and 8 (16.66%) after adalimumab. Most patients had pulmonary and/or lymphnode involvement, with 8 cases of cutaneous manifestations, mainly of erythema nodosum.6,10
Despite all the anti-TNF drugs having the ability to block pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-, they possess marked differences in their own structures, as well as their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics' attributes, which explains, in part, the diversity that may be observed in clinical efficacy and adverse events, including the triggering of granulomatous lesions.7
The inhibition of TNF-  by etanercept is not a complete one, since this drug connects only to the soluble TNF receptor and not to the transmembrane receptor, as occurs with infliximab and adalimumab. Partial neutralization of TNF-  by etanercept permits the redistribution of this cytokine in areas of lower concentration, such as the lungs. This may explain the stronger association of granulomatous reactions with the use of etanercept.8,10
The treatment of such cases has been the suspension of the anti-TNF agent and in some cases, as reported here, the introduction of corticoids. The mean time to recovery of symptoms after the interruption of the drug is 5.2 months.6
Considering that these drugs are increasingly used in dermatology, we must remain alert to the possibility of sarcoidosis, especially if respiratory symptoms, or erythema nodosum and/or granulomatous cutaneous eruptions arise.q

Abstract
Introduction: The present study aims to evaluate the utility of D-dimer testing for differentiating the causes of acute chest pain, including acute aortic dissection (AAD), pulmonary embolism (PE), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina (UA), and other uncertain diagnoses of chest pain. Material and methods: Consecutive patients admitted for acute chest pain within 24 h from symptom onset were enrolled prospectively, and plasma D-dimer levels were measured on admission. Diagnoses of AAD, PE, AMI, and UA were confirmed by standard methods. Results: A total of 790 patients were enrolled, including 202 AAD, 43 PE, 315 AMI, 136 UA, and 94 cases of other uncertain diagnoses. D-dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with AAD and PE than in those with AMI, UA, and other uncertain diagnoses (p < 0.001), but they were comparable between patients with AAD and PE (p = 0.065). Moreover, patients with type A AAD had higher D-dimer levels than those with type B AAD (p = 0.022). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that a D-dimer level < 0.5 µg/ml was a good predictor for ruling out AAD, with a sensitivity of 94.0% and a specificity of 56.8%. At a cut-off level of 0.5 µg/ml, the negative and positive likelihood ratios were 0.10 and 2.18, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 42.6% and a negative predictive value of 96.6%. Conclusions: The D-dimer level within 24 h after symptom onset might be helpful for differentiating AAD from other causes of chest pain.
Key words: pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, chest pain.

Introduction
Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a relatively uncommon medical emergency with a high mortality after symptom onset. The mortality of acute type A aortic dissection increases by 1-2% per hour during the first 48 h if no treatment is received [1]. Meanwhile, other common causes of acute chest pain, such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and pulmonary embolism (PE), also require rapid differentiation from AAD due to their critical and lethal characteristics [2]. However, the misdiagnosis rate of AAD has been reported to be approximately 30% on initial evalu-

ation [3, 4]. Currently, noninvasive imaging modalities, including enhanced computed tomography (CT), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have been developed to improve the diagnosis of AAD, but these imaging modalities are expensive, time-consuming and unavailable at the bedside. Therefore, a rapid, cheap, reliable and sensitive laboratory test is urgently needed to diagnose AAD.
D-dimer, the degradation product of cross linked fibrin, is significantly elevated in AAD patients [5-8] and has been suggested for use as a complementary marker to rule out AAD [5-7, 9-11]. However, in real-world clinical practice, AAD, PE and AMI are all thrombogenic diseases with high mortality, and whether the D-dimer level is helpful for differentiating these diseases remains to be elucidated. We therefore conducted a prospective cohort study to evaluate the validity and reliability of D-dimer level for differentiating AAD from other types of acute chest pain, including PE, AMI, unstable angina (UA), and other uncertain diagnoses of chest pain.
Material and methods
Study population
A single-center, prospective cohort study was conducted in Fuwai Hospital (the National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases in China) from January 2009 to January 2010. A series of consecutive patients with acute chest pain who presented to the emergency department (ED) of Fuwai Hospital within 24 h of symptom onset were enrolled in a prospective manner. Baseline clinical characteristics such as sex, age, Stanford types of AAD, intervals from onset of symptoms to hospital admission, medical histories, baseline parameters of physical examinations and laboratory tests including C-reactive protein (CRP), imaging examinations, in-hospital managements, ED diagnosis and discharge diagnosis were recorded according to pre-designed case report forms. The study protocols were approved by the appropriate institutional review boards of Fuwai Hospital and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects provided written informed consent.
D-dimer test and diagnosis
Plasma D-dimer levels were measured using a stago-evolution device (France) in patients with chest pain immediately following admission. The results collected are expressed in micrograms per milliliter. The effective detection range of the assay is 0.22-20 µg/ml. Diagnoses of AAD and PE were confirmed by aorta or pulmonary angiography with multi-detector CT scan. Acute myocardial infarction was confirmed by acute chest pain, ele-

vated cardiac-enzyme levels (cardiac troponin I or T, or the MB fraction of creatine kinase exceeded the 99th percentile upper reference limit), documented findings of a new ST segment elevation/ depression or a new T wave inversion on electrocardiography, and/or with evidence of obstructive coronary artery on angiography. Unstable angina was confirmed by chest pain, ST segment depression or T wave changes with evidence of obstructive coronary artery on angiography, but without the elevation of cardiac enzymes.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are presented as mean ± SD or median and interquartile range according to whether they follow Gaussian distributions. Categorical data are presented as numbers and proportions. Baseline characteristics between groups were compared using Student's t test or the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test for continuous data and the c2 test for categorical data. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to calculate the sensitivity for AAD. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical calculations were performed with SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).
Results
A total of 790 patients were enrolled, including 202 AAD, 43 PE, 315 AMI, 136 UA, and 94 cases with other uncertain diagnoses. Of the 202 AAD patients confirmed by CT angiography, 119 (58.9%) were Stanford type A AAD cases and 83 (41.0%) were Stanford type B AAD cases.
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table I. Compared to the patients with other causes of chest pain, AAD patients were more likely to be younger and male and tended to have concomitant hypertension but rarely have diabetes mellitus (all p < 0.001).
The D-dimer level was elevated (> 0.50 µg/ml) in 190 (94.1%) AAD patients. The D-dimer level in AAD patients was approximately 9-fold higher than that in non-AAD patients (median: 4.19 vs. 0.45 µg/ml, p < 0.05). Figure 1 shows the D-dimer level in patients with different causes of chest pain. The D-dimer level was significantly higher in patients with AAD than in patients with UA (median: 0.38 µg/ml, p < 0.001), AMI (median: 0.45 µg/ml, p < 0.001) and other uncertain diagnoses (median: 0.44 µg/ml, p < 0.001), but it was comparable with that of PE patients (median: 2.72 µg/ ml, p = 0.065). Similarly, the D-dimer level in PE patients was significantly higher than that in patients with UA, AMI, or other uncertain diagnoses (all p < 0.001). Moreover, patients with type A AAD

Discussion
The present study demonstrated a significantly higher admission D-dimer level in patients with AAD within 24 h after symptom onset than those with AMI, UA, and other uncertain diagnoses. At the widely used cutoff level of 0.5 µg/ml, a favorable negative likelihood ratio of 0.10 and negative predictive value of 96.6% were found in patients with AAD. However, the D-dimer level was not significantly different between patients with AAD and PE. Our study suggests that a plasma D-dimer test within 24 h of symptom onset may be helpful for differentiating AAD and PE from other causes of acute chest pain.
Acute aortic dissection is a catastrophic medical emergency, which requires early and accurate diagnosis and treatment. Imaging modalities, including enhanced CT and MRI, can facilitate an accurate diagnosis. However, these methods are limited due to unavailability at the bedside and their time-consuming nature, and they are not cost effective for routine screening. Thus, a rapid and reliable biomarker is urgently needed. Previous studies have evaluated several biomarkers for AAD, such as the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain [12-14], the BB-isozyme of creatine kinase [15], and calponin [16]. However, none of these markers have been adopted into routine clinical practice due to their inability to meet the requirements of a `gold standard' biomarker including having adequate sensitivity and specificity in addition to a favorable time course of release that covers a time window necessary for nonambiguity in the clinical setting [17]. D-dimer is a fibrin fragment seen in coagulopathic disorders, and measurements are routinely used for the exclusion of venous thromboembolic diseases and PE [18-20]. In recent years, multiple studies have confirmed that D-dimer is elevated in AAD, and several studies have assessed its diagnostic value for AAD. However, at a defined cutoff value, the sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer for the diagnosis of AAD have been reported to vary, possibly due to differ-

ent assay methods used in different studies. Generally, when a cutoff value of 0.5 µg/ml is used, the sensitivity and negative predictive value can reach almost 100% with a specificity of 54-68.6% [5, 9], and the specificity can be increased to 73% when the cutoff value is 0.626 µg/ml [6]. Shimony et al. [21] recently performed a meta-analysis of D-dimer to diagnose AAD and found that at a cutoff value of 0.5 µg/ml, the sensitivity and negative predictive value were 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. However, the specificity and positive predictive value were low, 0.56 and 0.60, respectively. Moreover, the negative likelihood ratio showed an excellent discriminative ability (0.06), whereas the positive likelihood ratio did not (2.43). They concluded that a plasma D-dimer level < 0.5 µg/ml was a useful screening tool to identify patients who do not have AAD. Therefore, the plasma D-dimer level may thus be used to identify subjects who are unlikely to benefit from further aortic imaging. Our results were consistent with this study, suggesting that the cutoff value of D-dimer < 0.5 µg/ ml, which is widely used for excluding PE [22], is also applicable for the exclusion of AAD. However, the D-dimer level in patients with AAD is not always elevated, and several studies [23, 24], including ours, have observed this phenomenon. Hazui et al. [25] proposed that younger patients with a short dissection length and a thrombosed false lumen without ulcer-like projections may have false-negative D-dimer results. Therefore, patients who present classic characteristics of AAD but have a negative D-dimer test should receive further aortic imaging.
Due to its non-specific characteristics, an elevated D-dimer level is also seen in patients with other morbidities such as PE, AMI, UA, and other diseases. Therefore, further investigation is necessary to clarify whether D-dimer tests can differentiate AAD from other diseases that presented with elevated D-dimer levels. Suzuki et al. [26] reported that when the cutoff level was 1.6 µg/ml, D-dimer was a useful tool for differentiating AAD from AMI, angina or other ischemic heart diseases

Admission D-dimer testing for differentiating acute aortic dissection from other causes of acute chest pain

within the first 6 h, and when the cutoff value was 0.8 or 0.9 µg/ml, the D-dimer level could differentiate AAD from AMI [27]. Sakamoto et al. [28] also found that a cutoff value of 0.5 µg/ml was effective for distinguishing AAD and PE from AMI, with a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 90%. Although their results were mostly consistent with ours, the cutoff values used in these studies were different and the obtained D-dimer levels in various causes of acute chest pain varied greatly. One possible explanation for this variation was the different measurement equipment and the test strip used. Therefore, a standard and unified detection protocol may improve the heterogeneity of measurement, making the detection value more reliable.
Additionally, the D-dimer level was elevated in both AAD and PE patients, with no significant difference in our study, consistent with the findings of Sakamoto et al. [28] and Eggebrecht et al. [6]. Given the high mortality of the two morbidities, immediate contrast CT imaging or tissue Doppler imaging [29] may be good choices to differentiate AAD from PE.
In the setting of AMI/UA, rupture of atherosclerotic plaques causes thrombopoiesis and activates fibrin degradation, leading to D-dimer formation. Therefore, D-dimer is elevated in patients with AMI/UA but not in patients with stable angina and healthy controls [30, 31]. Although the D-dimer level does not directly reflect the degree of myocardial damage, it has been confirmed that an elevated D-dimer level is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with AMI/UA [32, 33]. Therefore, the D-dimer level is not only a useful tool for the differentiation of diagnoses, but it also plays an important role in the prognostic evaluation for some cardiovascular diseases.
Some limitations of the present study need to be addressed. First, although our study shows good prediction for AAD with the D-dimer level at the cutoff of 0.5 µg/ml, the specificity is low (56.8%). Indeed, D-dimer as a diagnostic biomarker of AAD did have some limitations due to the relatively high false positive rate. Therefore, for patients with a D-dimer level > 0.5 µg/ml, the D-dimer level should be combined with other diagnostic tests, especially imaging tests, for an accurate diagnosis of AAD. Second, the small sample size of PE patients may affect the statistical power. Furthermore, the difference in D-dimer levels was not evaluated between patients with ST-segment elevation AMI and non-ST-segment elevation AMI. Therefore, further large, prospective, multi-center studies are needed.
In conclusion, the D-dimer level within 24 h after symptom onset might be helpful for differentiating patients with suspected AAD from other causes of chest pain.

Abstract

Background Limited data are available regarding the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly the new generation 3 Tesla technology, and especially diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in predicting liver fibrosis. The aim of our pilot study was to assess the clinical performance of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of liver parenchyma for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
Methods 18 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD underwent DWI with 3 Tesla MRI. DWI was performed with single-shot echo-planar technique at b values of 0-500 and 0-1000 s/mm2. ADC was measured in four locations in the liver and the mean ADC value was used for analysis. Staging of fibrosis was performed according to the METAVIR system.
Results The median age of patients was 52 years (range 23-73). The distribution of patients in different fibrosis stages was: 0 (n=1), 1 (n=7), 2 (n=1), 3 (n=5), 4 (n=4). Fibrosis stage was poorly associated with ADC at b value of 0-500 s/mm2 (r= -0.30, P=0.27). However it was significantly associated with ADC at b value of 0-1000 s/mm2 (r= -0.57, P=0.01). For this b value (0-1000 s/mm2) the area under receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.93 for fibrosis stage 3 and the optimal ADC cut-off value was 1.16 ×10-3 mm2/s.
Conclusion 3 Tesla DWI can possibly predict the presence of advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD.

deaths due to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of NAFLD is estimated between 20% and 30% in Western countries [1,2], rising to 90% in the morbidly obese patients [3]. NASH, the more advanced and clinically important form of NAFLD, is less common, with an estimated prevalence of 2-3% in the general population [4], and 37% in the morbidly obese [3].
Liver biopsy is currently the gold standard to guide therapeutic decisions and assess prognosis in patients with NAFLD. The development of non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis evaluation aims to reduce biopsy-related risk and cost and to facilitate improved monitoring of disease progression. Serological assays, such as Fibrotest, and radiological methods like transient elastography (Fibroscan, Echosens, France) are used increasingly to evaluate liver fibrosis in NAFLD and other chronic liver diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being evaluated as a non-invasive method of liver fibrosis assessment as well. Recently, MR elastography demonstrated excellent diagnostic accuracy with sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 99% respectively for detecting all grades of fibrosis [5].

Diffusion-weighted MRI in liver fibrosis 119

Another MRI technique, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), has been lately used for liver fibrosis assessment. Diffusion is a physical property, which describes the microscopic random movement of (water) molecules driven by their internal thermal energy. Diffusion is quantitatively reflected in a diffusion coefficient, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC, expressed in mm2/s). Conflicting results regarding the reliability of DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in liver fibrosis staging for patients with chronic liver disease are reported [6,7], while several studies have shown a decrease in hepatic ADC in liver cirrhosis [8-10].
The aim of our study was to assess the clinical performance of DWI performed with 3 Tesla MRI scanners for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD.
Patients and methods
Patients
We included only patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD in this study. Patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C virus antibody or histological evidence of concomitant liver disease were excluded from the study. Patients with alcohol consumption of more than 40 g/day were also excluded. All patients underwent percutaneous liver biopsy (LB) and then DWI within a 3-month interval. Anthropometric tests included body weight, body height, and waist circumference measurements. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared. On the day of liver biopsy, a fasting venous blood sample was taken for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, albumin, glucose, total cholesterol, and triglycerides.
DWI
DWI was performed on a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (SIgna HDxT, General Electric, Milwaukee) with the aid of 8 channel Torso phased-array coil. Diffusion was in all cases acquired with respiratory gating with a Single Shot Echo Planar Imaging (DW-EPI) pulse sequence. Parallel imaging with Array Spatial Sensitivity Encoding Technique (ASSET) factor of 2 was used to improve image quality. DWI was performed in the axial plane with tri-directional diffusion gradients using three b values, namely, 0, 500, and 1000 s/mm2. The repetition time (TR) was on the average 10,288 ms (between 8,571 and 13,330), echo time (TE) between 63.7 - 67.9 ms, slice thickness 6 mm, gap between slices 1 mm, matrix 128 × 128, field of view 400 mm, number of excitations 4. The total acquisition time was on the average 4-5 min. The ADC maps were calculated by commercial workstation software (GE Healthcare) over four random locations within the liver using 1-2 cm2 regions of interest away from the intrahepatic vasculature. Mean ADC values were used for analysis (Fig. 1).

Liver biopsy
LB procedures were performed by experienced physicians using the intercostal approach with 1.6 and 1.8 mm diameter Menghini needles. All biopsies had at least 1.5 cm length and were evaluated by experienced liver pathologists using the METAVIR scoring system for staging fibrosis from 0 to 4: stage 0=absence of fibrosis; stage 1=perisinusoidal or portal; stage 2=perisinusoidal and portal/periportal; stage=3 septal or bridging fibrosis; and stage 4=cirrhosis. Grade of liver steatosis was defined according to Kleiner et al: 0=steatosis <5%, 1=5% to 33%, 2=steatosis >33%-66%, 3=steatosis >66% [11].
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were presented as means ± standard deviation or median (range) and frequency data were presented as number and percentage. The correlations of ADC with different variables were explored using the Spearman's  correlation. The performance of ADC was assessed using the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. Based on the ROC curve, a cutoff value was designated for ADC to maximize the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.
Results
Table 1 summarizes the baseline patients' characteristics. 18 patients were included in our study. The median age of our patients was 52 years (range 23-73). The mean BMI was 28.1 kg/m2 (range 20.3-38.2). 78% percent of subjects were male. The median values for AST, ALT, glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, albumin, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels were 37.5 IU/L (18-132); 58 IU/L (19-132); 98 mg/dL (86-176); 217 mg/dL (169-275); 150 mg/dL (77-305); 4.5 g/dL (4.1-4.9); 0.7 mg/dL (0.1-1.4); 108 IU/L (57-330), respectively. The distribution of patients in different fibrosis stages was: 0 (n=1), 1 (n=7), 2 (n=1), 3 (n=5), 4 (n=4). Degree of steatosis was: 0 (n=0), 1(n=7), 2(n=3), 3(n=8).

ADC correlation with clinical variables

DWI examination was technically successful in all patients. Data processing was possible in all subjects. ADC at b value of 0-1000 s/mm2 had a significant inverse correlation with age (r=-0.66, P=0.002). It was also correlated with anthropometric characters, like BMI and waist circumference (r=-0.47, P=0.04 and r=-0.46, P=0.05, respectively). Total cholesterol and AST levels were the only laboratory values that showed a relationship with ADC (r=-0.53, P=0.05 and r=-0.58, P=0.01, respectively). All these relationships were not found significant for ADC at b value of 0-500 s/mm2.

ADC correlation with histological parameters
Steatosis was not associated with ADC, neither for b value of 0-500 s/mm2 (P=0.64), or for b value of 0-1000 s/mm2 (P=0.09). Fibrosis stage was poorly associated with ADC at b value of 0-500 s/mm2 (r= -0.30, P=0.27) yet it was significantly associated with ADC at b value of 0-1000 s/mm2 (r= -0.57, P=0.01) For this b value (0-1000 s/mm2) the area under ROC curve was 0.93 for fibrosis stage 3 and the optimal ADC cut-off value was 1.16 × 10-3 mm2/s by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity (positive predictive value: 100%, negative predictive value: 90%) (Fig. 2, 3). Namely, no patient with fibrosis stage <3 had ADC value lower than 1.16 × 10-3 mm2/s, whereas only 1 patient with fibrosis stage 3 had ADC value greater than 1.16 × 10-3 mm2/s. Significant decrease in ADC values was seen in patients with fibrosis stage 3 versus fibrosis stage 2, especially for b value of 0-1000 s/mm2 (Table 2).
The ability to discriminate fibrosis stage 2 at b value of 0-1000 s/mm2 was also very good (area under ROC curve 0.88). As the sample of patients was very similar (only one patient had fibrosis stage 2) between the groups with fibrosis stage 3 and 2, the optimal ADC cut-off value for this group of patients was the same (1.16 × 10-3 mm2/s), but with different predictive values (positive predictive value: 100%, negative predictive value: 80%). However, the ability to diagnose

cirrhosis (fibrosis stage 4) was poor (area under ROC curve 0.64, positive predictive value: 43%) and only exclusion of this condition could be safely predicted (negative predictive value: 91%).

Discussion
The diagnosis and treatment of patients with NAFLD depends significantly on liver fibrosis staging. Liver biopsy is still considered the ``gold standard" for the assessment of liver fibrosis and is currently recommended by professional society practice guidelines. Although generally safe, this procedure is invasive and has a minor possibility of serious adverse events (hemorrhage, death) [12]. In addition, the accuracy of liver biopsy varies significantly depending on inter-observer variability and sampling error. This results in up to 30% falsenegative results and underestimation of cirrhosis, especially in small (<1.5cm) or fragmented specimens [13-16].
During the last decade a number of non invasive methods for liver fibrosis assessment have been introduced. MRI methods like MR elastography, spectroscopy and DWI are being evaluated as non invasive methods of liver fibrosis assessment. Advantages of MRI methods include the ability

Diffusion-weighted MRI in liver fibrosis 121

to scan the whole liver to minimize sampling error, the lack of requirement for an acoustic window as in transient elastography, insensitivity in body habitus and ascites and, finally, the ability to obtain conventional MRI in the same setting.
DWI is affected by the biophysical properties of tissue cell organization (cell membranes, fibers and macromolecules), density, microstructure and microcirculation. Pathological processes which change the volume ratio or physical nature of intra- and extracellular spaces affect the diffusion of water molecules. Restricted or impeded diffusion is seen in tissues with high cellularity, e.g. tumors, abscesses, fibrosis and cytotoxic edema. Relative free or unimpeded diffusion is encountered in tissues with low cellularity or tissues with disrupted cell membranes, for example in cysts and necrotic tissues [17-20]. Low ADC values mean restricted diffusion, thus in tissues which are highly cellular. High ADC values are seen in areas with relative free diffusion, thus in tissues with low cellularity.
DWI performed with current generation scanners (1, 5 Tesla) does not appear to be reliable enough to replace liver biopsy [21]. Theoretically, the new generation 3 Tesla technology could improve hepatic ADC detection [22]. The increased signal to noise ratio inherent in the 3 Tesla scanners provides higher sensitivity in areas of restricted diffusion, while the use of parallel imaging through the reduction of TE reduces the susceptibility artifacts [23,24].
Our study showed a significant inverse correlation between liver fibrosis and ADC values taken in 3 Tesla DWI among NAFLD patients. This correlation was significantly associated with ADC at b value of 0-1000 s/mm2. ADC cut-off value of 1.16 × 10-3 mm2/s was shown to predict severe fibrosis (stage 3) thus providing a potentially useful tool for the assessment of these patients. To our knowledge there are only two reports regarding liver fibrosis correlation with ADC values performed on 3 Tesla MRI scanners in patients with chronic liver disease. The first one included 37 patients with chronic viral hepatitis and 34 healthy volunteers. The authors reported significant inverse correlation of ADC values with liver fibrosis with a b factor of 1000 s/mm2 [25]. The second one included 55 patients with chronic liver disease who had undergone DWI using 8 b-values at 3 Tesla. Significant correlation of ADC values with hepatic fibrosis was reported. Higher ADC values were seen in fibrosis stage F1 compared to fibrosis stage F=4 [26].
Conflicting results regarding liver fibrosis and DWI in 1.5 Tesla scanners are reported. Taouli et al [7] reported significant inverse correlation of ADC and liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease with AUC of 0.896 and cut off value of 1.03 × 10-3 mm2/s at 0-1,000 b value for fibrosis stage 3. Koinuma et al [27] evaluated a large population of patients (n=163), 31 of whom underwent liver biopsy and found significant inverse correlation between hepatic ADC and fibrosis stage in lower b value (128 s/mm2). Sandrasegaran et al [21] reported significantly lower ADCs in cirrhotic livers compared with nonfibrotic livers but ADC values were not useful for differentiating patients with fibrosis stage 2 from those with a lower degree of fibrosis. Lewin et al [28] compared DWI in 54 hepatitis C patients and 20 healthy volunteers with

FibroScan and FibroTest. They found that DWI was comparable to these tests in detecting severe fibrosis but they also reported significant overlap of ADC values between patients with mild and moderate fibrosis. Bakan et al [29] reported that lower ADC values were associated with higher fibrosis stages in 34 patients with chronic liver disease. Bonekamp et al [30] found that liver ADC values were inversely correlated with fibrosis stage. AUROCs of 0.79, 0.77, 0.77 and 0.79 were obtained for fibrosis stages 1,2,3, and 4 respectively.
This study also shows that ADC at b value at 0-1,000 s/mm2 has statistically significant inverse correlation with liver fibrosis compared to b value at 0-500 s/mm2. The sensitivity of a DWI sequence is characterized by its b value. The higher the b value, the more sensitive the sequence is to diffusion effects [21,31]. Boulanger et al [32] used DWI at b values of 50-250 s/mm2 in 18 chronic hepatitis C patients and 10 control subjects. They found no significant difference between the two groups. Interestingly the ADCs of patients with hepatitis C were even higher than those of controls. It is possible that differences between fibrotic and nonfibrotic liver cannot be detected at small b values (<300 s/mm2), which can increase the amount of perfusion contamination in ADC measurement [31,33]. In a recent study including 24 patients with chronic liver disease and 22 healthy volunteers, ADC values at b value of 750 s/mm2 or greater showed superior correlation with liver fibrosis compared to lower b values [34]. On the other hand, some researchers believe that there may be an advantage to calculating ADC values using an intermediate b value compared to a higher b value [35]. According to our results, we believe that 3 Tesla DWI at b value of 1,000 s/mm2 provides a relative advantage for liver fibrosis assessment compared to 1.5 Tesla technology scanners.
We acknowledge some limitations of our study. First, this is a pilot study where we report our preliminary experience with a small number of patients. Also, DWI is more expensive than other non invasive methods of liver fibrosis assessment with comparable effectiveness. In addition, MRE was shown to be superior in predicting liver fibrosis as compared with DWI in a recently published meta-analysis [36]. However, all studies included in this analysis were performed with 1.5 Tesla scanners. As it was recently pointed out, the strength of the magnetic field that the scanner uses plays a vital role in interpreting the results [37].
In conclusion, our findings suggest that 3 Tesla DWI can possibly predict the presence of advanced (3) fibrosis in patients with NAFLD especially when the b value is 0-1000 s/mm2. Future work is needed to assess a larger number

T he International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin Societies, typically abbreviated as Pacifichem, is one of
the largest conferences focusing on chemistry, typically
occurring every 5 years in the most central location of the Pacific region, Hawaii. Founded in 1984, Pacifichem 2021
(which begins today) will be the eighth in the series, and is
cosponsored by American Chemical Society, Canadian Society
for Chemistry, Chemical Society of Japan, Chinese Chemical
Society, Korean Chemical Society, New Zealand Institute of
Chemistry, and Royal Australian Chemical Institute. The Chemical Society of Japan hosts the 2021 Congress.1
The goal of Pacifichem is to foster collaborations among Pacific basin chemical scientists with the aim of building partnerships within the region with the hope of finding solutions
to global problems. The current conference was originally
scheduled to be held in 2020, but it was delayed to 2021 due to
the COVID-19 pandemic. With the continued uncertainty
relating to the pandemic coupled with marginal improvements
in many parts of the world, the board of directors made the difficult decision to turn the overall conference into a virtual
forum, with no in-person components. This means that, instead
of enjoying the tropical sunshine in between technical sessions,
conference attendees will meet virtually from various time zones. To this end, the organizers of each section made the effort to
reorganize the talks considering the time zones of the speakers
participating from all over the world. The main theme of Pacifichem 2021 is A Creative Vision for the
Future, with two subthemes of Core Chemistry and Chemistry for Global Challenges. Pacifichem 2021 will provide the platform for the disclosure and discussion of thousands of new findings in chemistry and related fields, providing new vistas addressing important problems facing humanity. Core Chemistry will
include Analytical, Organic, Inorganic, Physical, Computational
and Theoretical, Macromolecular and Biological, Materials
Science, Nanotechnology, Chemical Education and Communi-
cation, and Chemical/Biological/Biomedical Engineering sessions. Chemistry for Global Challenges will include Chemistry for
Sustainability, Chemistry for Energy, Chemistry for Health Care, and Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and Beyond. Because
the conference emphasizes the collaborative nature of chemistry
as a multidisciplinary science, this year, more than ever, its
central role in tackling major global challenges comes to the fore.
We originally planned to meet as many community members as possible in Honolulu, introducing JACS Au to the Pacifichem
community. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve,
we look forward to a future opportunity to meet in-person and discuss the role of JACS Au and open access publications in the
global chemistry publishing landscape. As a fully open access journal, the goal of JACS Au is to provide a highly selective venue

that covers the full breadth of chemistry-related topics. As we seek to become a leading open access journal, close communication with potential authors, readers, and reviewers is very important and conferences like Pacifichem provide an excellent opportunity to build such personal connections.
Several members of the JACS Au editorial team are involved in Pacifichem 2021. Prof. Christopher Jones is co-organizing a session of "Porous Materials: Synthesis, Characterization, and Utilization", Prof. Xin Xu is co-organizing a session on "Triangle of Heterogeneous Catalysis, Surface Science, and Theory", and Prof. Hyunjoo Lee will present talks in three different sessions: "Supported Single-Ion Catalysts", "New Directions in Homo/ Heterogeneous Catalysis of Hydrogen Production and CO2 Utilization", and "Design of Single-Site and Nano-Confined Catalysts for Environmental and Energy Uses".
If you will be attending the conference this year, please drop by one of our sessions virtually or reach out to us via other means. We will be very happy to discuss our research and answer any questions about JACS Au or open access publishing.

Ageing promotes pathological alpha-synuclein propagation and autonomic dysfunction in wild-type rats

Neuronal aggregates of misfolded alpha-synuclein protein are found in the brain and periphery of patients with Parkinson's disease. Braak and colleagues have hypothesized that the initial formation of misfolded alpha-synuclein may start in the gut, and then spread to the brain via peripheral autonomic nerves hereby affecting several organs, including the heart and intestine. Age is considered the greatest risk factor for Parkinson's disease, but the effect of age on the formation of pathology and its propagation has not been studied in detail. We aimed to investigate whether propagation of alpha-synuclein pathology from the gut to the brain is more efficient in old versus young wild-type rats, upon gastrointestinal injection of aggregated alpha-synuclein. Our results demonstrate a robust age-dependent gut-to-brain and brain-to-gut spread of alpha-synuclein pathology along the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, resulting in age-dependent dysfunction of the heart and stomach, as observed in patients with Parkinson's disease. Moreover, alpha-synuclein pathology is more densely packed and resistant to enzymatic digestion in old rats, indicating an age-dependent maturation of alpha-synuclein aggregates. Our study is the first to provide a detailed investigation of alpha-synuclein pathology in several organs within one animal model, including the brain, skin, heart, intestine, spinal cord and autonomic ganglia. Taken together, our findings suggest that age is a crucial factor for alpha-synuclein aggregation and complete propagation to heart, stomach and skin, similar to patients. Given that age is the greatest risk factor for human Parkinson's disease, it seems likely that older experimental animals will yield the most relevant and reliable findings. These results have important implications for future research to optimize diagnostics and therapeutics in Parkinson's disease and other age-associated synucleinopathies. Increased emphasis should be placed on using aged animals in preclinical studies and to elucidate the nature of age-dependent interactions.

Introduction
Neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease is associated with the presence of pathological aggregates of misfolded alpha-synuclein (a-syn) protein, the most important constituent of Lewy bodies and neurites. Up to 20 years before diagnosis, pathological a-syn inclusions are found not only in the brain, but also in several peripheral organs,1,2 including the gastrointestinal tract,3,4 heart5 and skin.6 Thus, nonmotor autonomic symptoms such as constipation and orthostatic hypotension are common during prodromal Parkinson's disease.7-9 Misfolded a-syn can transmit from cell-to-cell within the CNS, as well as from the peripheral nervous system (PNS) to the CNS.10 Braak and colleagues11 hypothesized that a-syn pathology may originate in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and spread to the brain via autonomic nerves. In support, truncal vagotomy in humans reduces the risk of Parkinson's disease by 40-50% after 10-20 years of follow-up,12,13 and the autonomic PNS is known to degenerate years in advance of the nigrostriatal dopamine system in some patients.14
Worldwide, 96% of patients with Parkinson's disease are above 50 years of age at the time of diagnosis, and Parkinson's disease affects more than 4% of the population aged 85 years or older.15 Therefore, age is considered the greatest risk factor for Parkinson's disease.16 Despite these facts, the propagation of misfolded a-syn has almost exclusively been investigated in young transgenic or wild-type animals. Misfolded a-syn protein, i.e. pathogenic seeds, is usually injected in the form of artificial preformed fibrils (PFFs) or Parkinson's disease brain lysate, and a-syn pathology has been shown to propagate both retrogradely and anterogradely along the vagus nerve.17-19 In young transgenic animals, injection of a-syn seeds into the gastrointestinal tract leads to robust propagating pathology to the CNS.20-22 However, such transgenic animals have artificially increased susceptibility towards a-syn aggregation, which is probably not an accurate reflection of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. In contrast, studies that used young wild-type animals generally failed to observe persistent PNS-to-CNS spreading of pathology.23,24
It is believed that initiation of a-syn pathology results from complex genetic-environmental interactions with ageing as the main risk factor.25 Ageing affects homeostatic processes that protect against protein misfolding and is associated with an increase in oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and mitochondrial-lysosomal dysfunction. The increased susceptibility to neurodegeneration caused by age-related cellular changes, together with failing compensatory clearance mechanisms contribute to the enhanced risk of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis in older subjects.26 Thus, it is conceivable that intact proteostatic mechanisms may be preventing progression of a-syn pathology in young wild-type

animals, including humans. Surprisingly, the role of ageing with respect to a-syn propagation and consequent symptom development in animal models of Parkinson's disease has received almost no attention.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of age on a-syn aggregation and the efficiency of a-syn pathology propagation from the gut to the autonomic PNS and brain, hereby providing an animal model that better emulates human idiopathic Parkinson's disease. We injected PFFs in the upper gastrointestinal tract of young adult, late adult, and old wild-type Fischer 344 rats. We then investigated the presence of a-syn pathology along with signs of synaptic dysfunction in the CNS, and several peripheral organs and tissues, including the gut, heart, autonomic ganglia, skin, muscle and kidney.
Materials and methods
Animals
Young adult (n = 15; 3 months old), late adult (n = 11; 10-12 months old), and old (n = 2; 18 months old) wild-type Fischer 344 rats were used (purchased from Envigo or Janvier). Here, the term `young' is used to refer to young adult rats, the term `adult' is used to refer to late adult rats, and the term `aged' is used to refer to the combined group of late adult and old rats.
Gastrointestinal seeding with a-synuclein fibrils
The experimental procedures involving animals were approved by The Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate (license 2016-150201-01004) and followed the Danish and European animal experimentation legislations (directive 2010/63/EU). Housing conditions, surgery, post-operative care and health monitoring of the animals were previously described.22 Recombinant PFFs (5 ml; 2 mg/ml) or PBS were injected into the gut wall of the pylorus and duodenum at six different sites spaced 0.5 cm apart using a 10 ml Hamilton syringe (25-gauge needle). The allocation of animals to the PFF and PBS groups was randomized. Two PFF types were used: wild-type mouse a-syn and human a-syn S129A mutant (non-phosphorylatable at Ser129 residue). Generation and validation of human a-syn fibrils (hPFFs) was previously described.22 The present fibrils belonged to the same batch. Wild-type mouse a-syn fibrils (mPFFs) were generated and validated with identical methodology. Animals were sacrificed 10 or 20 weeks post-injection. The term `seeding' refers to the injection of fibrillar a-syn `seeds'.

Ageing promotes gut-to-brain Parkinson's disease
Whole-gut transit time
We measured whole-gut transit time in young and late adult rats 10 and 20 weeks post-injection by recording the time between oral gavage with non-absorbable red dye (600 ml carmine red 6% and methylcellulose in PBS, Sigma-Aldrich) and output of a red faecal pellet.27,28 After gavage, faecal pellets were monitored every 3 h during the first 12 h, and every 30 min after that for the presence of carmine red.
Faecal output
Young and late adult rats were fasted overnight and water was withdrawn 3 h before the experiment. After fasting, the rats were transferred to a cage without bedding and were allowed food and water for 6 h. Following conclusion of the test, faecal pellets were collected and dabbed with paper towels to absorb urine released during the test. Pellets were weighed immediately to determine the wet weight, after which they were dried in an oven for 4 h at 80C to determine the dry weight and water weight per pellet. Finally, weights were normalized to body weight as determined right before the test. Additionally, food and water intake produced in that 6-h timeframe were measured and normalized to rat body weight.
Tissue collection and processing
At 10 and 20 weeks post-injection, the rats were sedated and perfused transcardially with PBS and phosphate-buffered 4% formaldehyde. The brain, spinal cord, cervical and coeliac ganglia, heart, stomach, pylorus, rectum, kidney, skin and muscle were sampled to study the route of a-syn pathology propagation through the autonomic connectome from gut to brain. The tissue was processed and cut as previously described.22 Sections (4-mm thick, 10-mm thick if skin) from several subjects (three to six subjects depending on section size) were randomized and mounted on one tissue slide. For the gut tissue, a control section was mounted on each slide to evaluate staining variability.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissue sections were deparaffinized and stained as described previously.22 To investigate solubility of the a-syn aggregates, the sections were pretreated with proteinase K (Ab64220/1:1000, Abcam). Supplementary Table 1 provides a list of the primary antibodies used in this study, including details about the supplier, concentration, and specificity. A pons and colon sample from two patients with reported Lewy pathology served as validation of our staining protocol against phosphorylated a-syn antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 1). Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were used to identify cholinergic innervation in the gut and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) respectively. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was used for identification of noradrenergic innervation in the heart, skin and locus coeruleus. Protein gene protein 9.5 (PGP9.5) was used for identification of nerve fibres and piloerector muscle in skin.
Quantification assessment of immunoreactivity
Images were collected from 4-lm thick sections using the Olympus VS120 automated slide-scanning microscope. We performed three types of quantification depending on the tissue-type: (i) quantification of immunoreactive density in brain tissue; (ii) quantification of immunoreactive area for brainstem, gut and heart tissue; and (iii) semi-quantification based on morphology and location in renal tissue.
For quantification of immunoreactive density, optical density values were calculated using ImageJ as described previously.22

BRAIN 2021: 144; 1853-1868 | 1855
Quantification of immunoreactive area in the brainstem, gut and heart was based on the percentage of immunoreactivity above a certain threshold to the total area of the DMV or locus coeruleus, the gut wall in a cross-section of the pylorus and stomach, or myocardium, respectively. The threshold is a minimum grey scale value applied as a cut-off for inclusion in the immunoreactive area, and calculated by averaging the individual thresholds that best represent the immunoreactivity in a positive control section (from the same animal) on each slide, using the Olympus cellSens threshold tool.
Quantification of a-syn pathology in renal tissue was based on assessment of morphology and location of phosphorylated a-syn deposits. Signal intensity (i.e. a-syn deposit maturity) in the renal medulla and cortex was evaluated separately on a semi-quantitative scale from 0 to 5: 1 (sparse granular deposits), 3 (dense granular deposits), and 5 (Lewy body-like deposits). In case of ambiguity, an intermediate score of 2 or 4 was attributed. When a sample contained different types of deposits, the score represents the most mature deposit. Quantification was performed in a blinded fashion.
Statistical analyses
Two-way ANOVAs were used to interrogate group differences, with post hoc Tukey test to adjust for multiple comparisons among groups. Results are presented using box and whisker plots containing minimum, maximum, interquartile interval and median value, and P 5 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Spearman's correlation was used to test for relationships between cholinergic or noradrenergic innervation and a-syn pathology, in the stomach and the heart respectively.

Results
Age-dependent a-synuclein pathology in the CNS
We injected groups of young (3 months old), adult (10-12 months old), and old rats (18 months old) intragastrically with either hPFFs, mPFFs or PBS and analysed subsequent appearance of asyn pathology in their CNS at 10 and 20 weeks post-injection (Figs 1 and 2). Young rats did not display any well-defined CNS pathology. In contrast, adult and old rats showed deposits of phosphorylated a-syn throughout the brain at 10 weeks post injection The brain areas most heavily affected with a-syn pathology included the DMV, locus coeruleus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, amygdala, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, retrosplenial granular cortex, and olfactory bulb. However, pathology in the DMV and locus coeruleus was absent or minor at 20 weeks post-injection, suggesting that a-syn pathology in the lower brainstem is transient--at least in adult rats (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, we observed extensive a-syn pathology throughout the brains of young wild-type rats seeded with mPFFs but not hPFFs, indicating that mPFFs are more potent than hPFFs to induce initiation and propagation of a-syn pathology in wild-type rats. Additionally, our data indicate that wild-type Fischer 344 rats develop minor spontaneous age-dependent a-syn pathology in some brain areas but not in the lower brainstem. The spontaneous pathology in age-matched controls was significantly lower compared to seeded rats in all brain areas at 10 weeks post-injection and at all brain areas except the lower brainstem at 20 weeks post-injection (Figs 1, 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2).

Age-dependent a-synuclein pathology and neurodegeneration in the enteric nervous system
Old and adult rats seeded with hPFFs showed significantly more pathology at the injection site (pylorus) than seeded young rats

and age-matched controls, indicating that the initiation and shortterm persistence of misfolded a-syn formation is age-dependent (Figs 3B and 4A). Figure 3A shows the co-localization of a-syn pathology and cholinergic innervation (VAChT immunoreactivity) in the pylorus. VAChT immunoreactivity was similar across groups.

Scale bar = 50 mm.

Ageing promotes gut-to-brain Parkinson's disease
In young rats the pathology at the injection site was much more severe after seeding with mPFFs compared to seeding with hPFFs, and resembled the pathology in old rats seeded with hPFFs (Figs 3B and 4A).
In the stomach wall, several centimetres from the injection site, we also observed significantly more phosphorylated a-syn pathology in old and adult compared to young hPFF-seeded rats and age-matched controls. However, in contrast to the pylorus, we did not observe increased levels of pathology in the stomach wall of young mPFF-seeded rats. Furthermore, VAChT immunoreactivity was decreased in the stomach wall in seeded adult and old rats at 10 and 20 weeks compared to seeded young and age-matched control rats (Figs 3B and 4A), supported by a negative correlation between VAChT and phosphorylated a-syn immunoreactivity in the stomach wall of seeded rats (Pearson's q = -0.51; Fig. 4B). This apparent loss of cholinergic innervation might explain the delayed gastric emptying in adult rats at 20 weeks post-injection compared to young and age-matched control rats (Fig. 4C). A non-significant trend towards delayed gastric emptying was also observed at 10 weeks post-injection and in age-matched controls. Pellet size and stool water weight were also reduced in adult rats as opposed to young rats at 20 weeks post-injection. After overnight fasting, water intake remained similar across groups, but food intake was significantly reduced in adult rats at 20 weeks. Taken together, these results indicate an age-dependent anterograde brain-to-gut spread that is associated with cholinergic neurodegeneration and gut dysfunction.
Finally, we observed slight spontaneous a-syn pathology in the pylorus and stomach of both young and adult control rats injected with PBS as depicted in Fig. 3B. The spontaneous pathology in controls was significantly lower than in age-matched seeded rats (Fig. 4B).
Age-dependent a-synuclein pathology and neurodegeneration in the sympathetic nervous system
After seeding with hPFFs, striking a-syn pathology was observed in coeliac ganglia and cervical ganglia of the sympathetic trunk in aged, but not in young rats (Fig. 5A and B). Remarkably, in the autonomic ganglia of young rats, no pathology was seen after seeding with hPFFs, but substantial pathology was seen after seeding with mPFFs, resembling the pathology in old and adult rats seeded with hPFFs.
Furthermore, we detected very localized pathology in the intermediolateral nucleus (IML) of aged, but not in young hPFF-seeded rats nor in age-matched controls (Fig. 5C). The pathology ranged from a dot-like pattern to single inclusion- or neurite-type assemblies. Phosphorylated a-syn deposits were also detected in the IML of young rats seeded with mPFFs; however, to a lesser extent compared to old hPFF-seeded rats.
In the heart, progressive a-syn pathology was detected in myocardial ganglia and sympathetic nerves of aged, but not in young hPFF-seeded rats nor in age-matched controls. As shown in Fig. 6, a-syn deposits co-localized with TH immunoreactivity. These results indicate age-dependent anterograde propagation from the cervical ganglia of the sympathetic trunk to the sympathetic ganglia of the myocardium. Moreover, quantitative assessment of cardiac a-syn and noradrenergic fibres showed a negative correlation (Pearson's q = -0.56; Fig. 6C). Cardiac denervation was significant at 20 weeks post-injection in adult seeded rats (but not in young) compared to age-matched controls. We observed a trend towards cardiac denervation in adult rats at 10 weeks post-injection, and this trend was significant in old seeded rats.

Minor a-syn pathology was observed in the myocardium of young rats seeded with mPFFs. Of note, we detected low-level spontaneous a-syn pathology in autonomic ganglia of rats after PBS injection, whereas the IML and heart remained free of phosphorylated a-syn pathology (Fig. 6).
We then proceeded to investigate other relevant but understudied organs. We detected phosphorylated a-syn deposits in the skin, muscle, and kidney of adult rats seeded with hPFFs. In the skin, a-syn deposits were observed in sympathetic nerves, arterioles, arteries, and piloerector muscles of adult rats at 20 weeks, but not in young rats nor in age-matched controls (Supplementary Fig. 4A and B). A skin sample from a human patient with pure autonomic failure (PAF) served as validation of our protocol (PAF patients show copious amounts of a-syn pathology in the skin6). The immunoreactive patterns of a-syn pathology in arterioles and nerves were similar in the patient (Supplementary Fig. 4C) and our rat skin samples, although the level of pathology between rats was quite variable as indicated in Supplementary Fig. 4D. a-Syn pathology in muscle tissue was observed in one single adult rat seeded with hPFFs. In this rat, the pathology was more prominent in the thoracic spine muscle compared to the sciatic muscle (Supplementary Fig. 4E and F). In renal tissue, phosphorylated a-syn inclusions were detected in adult rats at 20 weeks with hPFFs, and co-localized with sympathetic nerves (Supplementary Fig. 5). Sparse a-syn deposits were detected in muscle and renal tissue of young wild-type rats seeded with mPFFs.
Neuropathological findings in young and aged hPFF-seeded rats are summarized in Fig. 7, which includes a schematic overview of the hypothesized trans-synaptic gut-to-brain propagation of a-syn pathology through the autonomic connectome, thereby suggesting a sequential involvement of different organs and structures. At stage 0, injected hPFFs can convert endogenous asyn into misfolded a-syn in aged and young rats. The templating pathology propagates retrogradely along the parasympathetic pathway to the DMV (stage 1) in aged but not in young rats, and subsequent caudo-rostral propagation is seen in the brainstem with involvement of the locus coeruleus (stage 2) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (stage 3). In addition, a-syn pathology propagates through the sympathetic nervous system via the coeliac ganglia (stage 1) to the IML of the spinal cord and the sympathetic trunk including cervical ganglia (stage 2) in aged but not in young rats. From the sympathetic trunk, the pathology propagates anterogradely to sympathetic structures of the myocardium, skin, muscle, and kidney (stage 3). Moreover, pathology is detected in the myenteric ganglia of the stomach (stage 2) several centimetres from the injection site indicative of anterograde (brain-to-gut) propagation from the DMV or coeliac ganglia.
Mouse PFFs were considerably more potent than hPFFs with respect to initiating early (i.e. stage 0-2) gut-to-brain propagation in young wild-type rats. Strikingly, pathology was absent or minor in stage 3 structures such as the heart, skin, muscle and kidney, indicating that age is a crucial factor for complete propagation through the autonomic connectome. Further seeding studies in aged rats with mPFFs would be valuable to confirm our observations.
Age-dependent maturation of a-synuclein pathology
Figure 8 shows high magnification micrographs of a-syn pathology deposits in myenteric ganglia of the pylorus, myocardial ganglia and cortex of young, adult and old hPFF-seeded rats. In myenteric ganglia of young rats, a-syn immunoreactivity showed a solely granular appearance. The density and size of these granules appeared to increase with age, manifesting in Lewy-body like inclusions in older rats. Phosphorylated a-syn deposits were absent in the heart of young rats, and displayed a granular or

neurite-like appearance in adult rats and larger inclusion bodies in old rats. Phosphorylated a-syn pathology throughout the brain exhibited mainly a diffuse appearance. In adult and old rats, occasional dense rings of deposits around cell nuclei were detected in addition to a more general diffuse immunoreactivity. Phosphorylated a-syn pathology was resistant against proteinase K in adult rats at 20 weeks (but not at 10 weeks) post-injection and also in old rats at 10 weeks post-injection, and showed a dot-like appearance in the gut and in the heart, but not in the brain.

Staining against conformation-specific a-syn or fibrillar a-syn showed a higher signal in both myenteric and myocardial ganglia of all subjects compared to staining against phosphorylated a-syn, indicating that not all a-syn aggregates were phosphorylated.

Figure 7 Overview of hypothetical, sequential gut-to-brain propagation of a-syn pathology through the autonomic nervous system in aged Fischer 344 rats and neuropathological findings. Left: In the pylorus (stage 0), the injected a-syn fibrils induce the conversion of endogenous a-syn into a-syn pathology, which propagates retrogradely along the parasympathetic pathway to the DMV (stage 1). Subsequent caudo-rostral propagation is seen in the brainstem with involvement of the locus coeruleus (LC, stage 2) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata neuropil (SNr, stage 3). Furthermore, asyn pathology propagates through the sympathetic nervous system via the coeliac ganglion (CMG, stage 1) to the IML of the spinal cord and sympathetic trunk including cervical ganglia (CG, stage 2), from where it spreads anterogradely to sympathetic structures of the myocardium (stage 3). In addition, pathology is detected in the myenteric ganglia of the stomach (stage 2) several centimetres from the injection site indicative of anterograde propagation from the DMV or CMG. Finally, pathology is detected in sympathetic nerves of several peripheral structures, including skin, muscle and kidney (stage 3). Right: Representative micrographs of a-syn pathology in several tissues of aged (12-18 months) and young rats upon seeding with human fibrils. There is no propagation of a-syn pathology beyond the pylorus (stage 0) in young rats seeded with human fibrils.

gut-brain axis in wild-type hPPF-seeded rats; (ii) apparent vagal denervation in the stomach and sympathetic cardiac denervation are age-dependent and correlate with the amount of a-syn pathology; (iii) phosphorylated a-syn deposits are more dense and more proteinase K resistant in old animals; (iv) mPFFs are more potent than hPFFs to induce gut-to-brain propagation of a-syn pathology in young rats, which may reflect a species barrier; and (v) pathological findings in aged animals injected with hPFFs were similar or sometimes worse than those in young rats injected with mPFFs, suggesting that ageing lowers the species barrier.
Age-dependent CNS pathology
We and others have shown that upper gastrointestinal tract injections of a-syn pathology in rodents robustly induce stereotypical gut-to-brain propagation via peripheral nerves.22,29 Here we show that pathogenesis in the CNS appears to be heavily age-dependent as we observed phosphorylated a-syn pathology throughout the whole brain of adult and old wild-type rats, at 10 weeks post injection with hPFFs. In contrast, only minimal CNS involvement was seen in our young rats. Somewhat surprisingly, the a-syn pathology we observed in the DMV and locus coeruleus of adult rats appeared to be relatively transient, and showed markedly attenuated or absent staining intensity at 20 weeks post-injection with hPFFs, when compared to 10 weeks post-injection. This declining magnitude of a-syn pathology could not be ascribed to neuronal loss in the DMV and locus coeruleus, since the percentage

immunoreactive area of noradrenergic and cholinergic markers remained similar across groups (Supplementary Fig. 3). A similar lack of persisting CNS pathology was noted in previous studies of young rodents and non-human primates following a-syn seeding in the gut.23,24 Notably, a recent study using mature monkeys showed no DMV pathology at 2 years post gastrointestinal seeding, supporting our finding of lacking a-syn pathology in the DMV in adult rats at later time points.30 In contrast to our findings, Kim et al.29 did observe progressive pathology in the brainstem upon seeding young wild-type mice with hPFFs up to 7 months post injection. Interestingly, they report a non-significant trend of decreasing pathology in the entire brainstem, but not in the rest of the brain, at 10 months compared to 7 months post-injection, indicating potential transient brainstem pathology at later time points. This observation in animal models is at odds with human data, since 90% of Parkinson's disease patients have pathology in the DMV.11 It could be speculated that DMV pathology is reversible in some animals but permanent in most human patients. In more rostral brain structures, the pathology was clearly age-dependent and progressive in seeded rats.
One previous study investigated ageing effects on gut-to-brain transmission of a-syn pathology upon gut seeding,31 but the investigation of ageing effects was limited to the ENS with focus on disruptions of ENS network connectivity and the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi-lysosome pathway. Furthermore, the detection of pathology was limited to the injection site and to the DMV with minor transient pathology. In contrast, we observed a striking

Figure 8 Age-dependent manifestation of enteric, cardiac and cortical a-syn aggregates. High-magnification micrographs of a-syn deposits in pyloric myenteric ganglia (top), myocardial ganglia (middle) and cortex (bottom) of young, adult (20 weeks post-injection) and old (10 weeks post-injection) rats seeded with human fibrils. Top: In myenteric ganglia of the pylorus and duodenum, aggregates detected with fibrillar a-syn antibody (Ab209538) or phosphorylated a-syn antibody (Ab51253) displayed a solely granular appearance in young subjects. The density and size of these granules increases with age, with detection of Lewy-body like inclusions in older subjects. Phosphorylated a-syn pathology (phospho) was resistant against pretreatment with proteinase K (PK) solely in adult rats at 20 weeks post-injection and old rats at 10 weeks post-injection, and had a dot-like appearance. Scale bar = 20 mm. Middle: In myocardial ganglia, fibrillary a-syn deposits displayed a similar granular appearance across all ages but increased in density and diameter with age. Phosphorylated a-syn deposits were absent in the heart of young rats, but showed a granular or neurite-like appearance in adult rats and inclusion-like appearance in old rats. Phosphorylated a-syn pathology was resistant against proteinase K pretreatment solely in adult rats at 20 weeks post-injection or old rats at 10 weeks post-injection, and had a dot-like appearance. In general, fibrillary a-syn immunoreactivity was stronger than phosphorylated a-syn immunoreactivity. Scale bar = 20 mm. Bottom: Phosphorylated a-syn pathology throughout the brain mainly showed a diffuse appearance (top row). In adult and old rats sporadic ring-like inclusions were detected surrounding the cell nucleus as well as extranuclear or extracellular (resembling Lewy pathology) in addition to diffuse immunoreactivity. Scale bar = 10 mm. In aged animals, prominent axonal staining was observed in the frontal cortex and striatum (bottom row). Scale bar = 10 mm (axonal stain detail) and 50 mm (axonal stain overview).

Ageing promotes gut-to-brain Parkinson's disease
trans-synaptic gut-to-brain propagation of a-syn pathology through the autonomic connectome, involving key structures known to be affected in human Parkinson's disease, including the DMV, locus coeruleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. In contrast to our findings, the cited study reported reduced levels of striatal dopamine in seeded aged mice but not young mice, which may suggest that age-related altered neurotransmission precedes a-syn aggregation.32,33
Furthermore, we detected localized pathology in the IML of adult and old, but not young rats seeded with hPFFs. This a-syn pathology in the IML of aged rats resembled the grain or dot-like pathology pattern detected in the IML of Parkinson's disease patients older than 85 years old.34 Our results indicate a prominent age-dependent retrograde spread of a-syn pathology from the injection site to the coeliac ganglia and IML in wild-type rats seeded with hPFFs.
Taken together, our results indicate that old age is a crucial factor for effective gut-to-brain propagation of a-syn pathology in wild-type rats upon gut seeding. Age-matched control rats did show progressive levels of spontaneous a-syn pathology in the brain (except the brainstem), but considerably higher levels of asyn pathology was seen in seeded rats. These results indicate that ageing itself may contribute to protein aggregation. Thus, an interplay of both the ageing and aggregation process may contribute to disease initiation and progression upon seeding. It is well-known that misfolded a-syn mimics the behaviour of prions, and the process of ageing has also been noted to increase vulnerability in the context of true prion disorders.35-37 It is conceivable that in Parkinson's disease, the ageing process itself could also alter biochemical properties of physiological a-syn protein, making it more prone to convert into pathogenic misfolded a-syn. Besides biochemical changes to native a-syn protein, the ageing process also affects homeostatic processes that protect against protein misfolding, including mitochondrial-lysosomal dysfunction, increased oxidative stress and altered calcium homeostasis.26,38 Our data are in agreement with ageing studies in prion disease research, and we speculate that the combination of both age-related cellular changes and failing compensatory clearance mechanisms contribute to the enhanced risk of a-syn pathology progression in older subjects.
Age-dependent enteric nervous system pathology
While considerably higher levels of a-syn pathology were observed in seeded rats compared to age-matched controls, this particular rat strain does develop slight spontaneous gastrointestinal pathology with increasing age.39,40 We detected significantly more pathology in the stomach (away from the injection site) of adult and old seeded rats, which suggests anterograde DMV-to-gut or coeliac ganglion-to-gut propagation after initial retrograde spreading. Of note, bidirectional propagation of misfolded a-syn through the vagus has previously been documented.18,19,22 Bidirectional propagation through the vagus has important implications for the understanding of Parkinson's disease and how to interpret spatial patterns and temporal sequences of a-syn propagation in histopathology studies of Parkinson's disease patients.
We observed markedly higher levels of phosphorylated a-syn in the myenteric plexus than in the submucosal plexus of the gut wall. This pathology was mainly cytoplasmic with sporadic immunoreactivity in the nucleus of old rats. These results corroborate findings in aged bacterial artificial chromosome mice, where cell bodies of the myenteric plexus mostly contained a-syn pathology in aged mice, but not in young.41 Since phoshorylated a-syn showed preferential colocalization with VAChT immunoreactivity in the gut wall, it seems that specifically cholinergic neurons in

BRAIN 2021: 144; 1853-1868 | 1865
the myenteric plexus are targeted. It has been reported that a-syn is preferentially expressed in the axons of cholinergic enteric neurons in the guinea-pig ileum and human colon, suggesting specific vulnerability of enteric cholinergic neurons to Parkinson's disease.42,43
Interestingly, we observed decreased cholinergic innervation in the stomach wall of seeded adult and old rats, correlating with enteric a-syn pathology. These results indicate that a-syn pathology leads to progressive cholinergic synaptic dysfunction. Of note, Parkinson's disease patients also show decreased small intestinal and colonic cholinergic signal on 11C-donepezil PET.14,44
Delayed gastric emptying and decreased stool water weight were observed in adult rats at 20 weeks but not at 10 weeks postinjection, suggesting that cholinergic dysfunction in the stomach precedes symptom development. Another study reported delayed gut transit time and decreased faecal water weight in wild-type mice from 2 months post-injection.31
Age-dependent sympathetic pathology
We observed significantly more a-syn pathology in autonomic ganglia and myocardium of old and adult rats seeded with hPFFs compared to young rats and age-matched controls. Thus, it seems that initial a-syn pathology originating in the gut rapidly propagates via the coeliac ganglia to the sympathetic trunk, and then anterogradely to cardiac sympathetic nerve terminals. A recent study using transgenic mice reported that direct PFF-seeding in autonomic ganglia lead to trans-synaptic a-syn propagation to the CNS, as well as to the heart and ENS, accompanied by orthostatic hypotension and constipation.45
The immunoreactive area of cardiac a-syn pathology was negatively correlated to the immunoreactive area of cardiac TH, suggesting that a-syn pathology in the cardiac sympathetic nerve fibres leads to synaptic dysfunction. In human Parkinson's disease, these fibres are often affected in the premotor phase and nearly all patients show marked cardiac denervation by Hoehn and Yahr stage 3.46,47
In addition, we observed age-dependent a-syn pathology (without apparent neurodegeneration) in sympathetic nerves of other peripheral structures, including the skin, muscle and kidney. Focus on skin research in Parkinson's disease has been intensified due to the possibility of using skin biopsies for diagnostics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a-syn pathology in the skin of a Parkinson's disease rodent model. We observed a-syn deposits in the piloerector muscle, arterioles, arteries and sympathetic nerves in the cervical dermis of adult but not in young rats at 20 weeks post-injection. In patients with Parkinson's disease, phosphorylated a-syn has been detected in dermal sympathetic nerve fibres of arterioles, piloerector muscle and sweat glands.48,49 Besides phosphorylated a-syn, cutaneous denervation is observed in Parkinson's disease patients with a proximal-to-distal gradient,50,51 but we did not see such loss of small nerve fibres in our rats. Finally, we also detected a-syn pathology in muscle tissue of one aged rat at 20 weeks post-injection and in the renal medulla of aged but not young hPFF-seeded rats.
a-Synuclein aggregation is related to neuronal dysfunction
Our data indicate progressive aggregation of a-syn protein throughout the brain (except the lower brainstem where the pathology was transient), and in gut and heart of wild-type rats seeded with hPFFs. Phosphorylation at Ser129 and proteinase K resistance of a-syn are among the most common pathogenic modifications of

1866 | BRAIN 2021: 144; 1853-1868
a-syn and are commonly used for Parkinson's disease diagnostics.52,53
In the myenteric and cardiac plexus, we observed dense aggregation in the cytosol of adult rats at 20 weeks, compared to 10 weeks post-injection which displayed a dot-like pattern of small immature aggregates. In addition, some Lewy-body like larger asyn inclusions were detected almost exclusively in old rats. In support, previous studies reported punctate a-syn immunoreactivity in the brainstem, autonomic ganglia and heart of young transgenic rats that became more condense inclusions over time.45,54 A recent in vitro study showed that maturation into Lewy bodies is followed by synaptic dysfunction, indicating that Lewy body formation is a driver of neurodegeneration.55 Our data support these findings as we detect dense a-syn inclusions in the gut and heart of the animals with strongest cholinergic or noradrenergic denervation respectively, i.e. late adult rats at 20 weeks post-injection and old rats at 10 weeks post-injection.
Furthermore, we observed that phosphorylated a-syn pathology in the cardiac and myenteric plexus was more resistant to enzymatic proteinase K digestion in aged rats. CNS pathology was apparently not proteinase K resistant. Since a-syn pathology was initiated in the gut of our animals, it is possible that CNS a-syn aggregates had had less time to consolidate into mature, proteinase K-resistant inclusions. However, the resistance of phosphorylated a-syn to proteinase K digestion is limited and depends heavily on the proteinase K antigen retrieval protocol.32,55,56 Interestingly, we detected elongated axonal staining with tiny asyn deposits and enhanced axonal outgrowth in the frontal cortex and striatum, specifically in some aged rats. It has been reported that a-syn induces enhanced axonal arborization in the cortex and striatal white matter tracts, and that this phenomenon is associated with axonal injury in early Parkinson's disease.57 As we did not observe neurodegeneration in the CNS, these results might indicate that axonal degeneration precedes neuronal degeneration and concomitant motor symptoms.
Species barrier
a-Syn pathology was mostly absent in young rats seeded with hPFFs at 10 weeks post-injection, in contrast to young rats seeded with mPFFs that displayed high levels of phosphorylated a-syn in the CNS and autonomic ganglia. These results reinforce that mPFFs are more potent inducers of a-syn pathology than hPFFs as shown previously.58-60 Human and mouse a-syn show a 95% sequence homology.61 Nonetheless, even small sequence incompatibilities greatly reduce the interface between the pathogenic seed and its substrate, subsequently limiting the toxicity of the pathogenic seed.62,63 And small structural differences in fibrillar a-syn result in divergent histopathology.64-66 Here, the concept of the species barrier reflects the complex interplay of natural mechanisms behind reduced transmission of a-syn pathology in young rats seeded with hPFFs, compared to mPFFs. Interestingly, pathology in stage 3 sympathetic structures, including the heart, skin, muscle and kidney were absent or minor in young mPFF-seeded rats, indicating that old age is crucial for a complete propagation pattern affecting the entire autonomic nervous system. These results indicate that ageing lowers the species barrier.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. In theory, the observed pathology both in the heart and in the stomach could have been caused by hematogenic seeding. It has been shown previously that intravenous injection of 50 mg of mPFFs can lead to disease at 6-7 months post-injection in transgenic mice.67 If a small amount of

N. Van Den Berge et al.
PFFs were to escape into the bloodstream during seeding, that amount would most likely be too little to initiate pathology, as we injected only 60 mg and also used wild-type rats, which have a decreased propensity to develop pathology compared to transgenic rodent models. Moreover, it has been shown by Kim et al.29 that vagotomy prevents gut-to-brain propagation in wild-type mice, providing evidence that the vagus nerve serves as a gateway for bidirectional transmission of pathology between the gut and the brain. Considering the striking a-syn pathology in the brainstem and coeliac ganglion in late adult and old rats at 10 weeks post injection, we find alternative explanations less likely.
Furthermore, rats were only followed up to 20 weeks, which may have been insufficient time for developing a full clinical picture including neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra and other important CNS nuclei. Further studies with long-term follow-up and elaborate motor symptom testing are required to investigate neurodegeneration in the brain and subsequent motor deficits. Additionally, we have only investigated two time points in this study. Extra intermediate time points would be beneficial to map out the brain-to-gut and gut-to-brain propagation more meticulously.
Finally, we opted to use 10 different experimental groups to maximize control of experimental variables. This, together with the use of aged animals, resulted in rather small sample sizes. Because of the binary nature of our immunohistochemical data, i.e. there is a lack of pathology or extensive pathology, we were able to obtain statistically significant differences among groups.
Conclusion
Nearly all published reports about Parkinson's disease wild-type models used young animals and often reported minimal propagation of a-syn pathology. Our results highlight that ageing in otherwise healthy animals substantially promotes the development of a-syn pathology, and is crucial for complete propagation to heart and skin like observed in human Parkinson's disease. Given that age is the greatest risk factor for human Parkinson's disease, it seems likely that older experimental animals will yield the most relevant and reliable findings, and that findings in young animals are probably not an accurate reflection of human Parkinson's disease.
Although a-syn pathology was widespread in both the CNS and PNS, neuronal degeneration was restricted to peripheral cholinergic and noradrenergic neurons at the early time points studied here. This observation indicates that peripheral autonomic neurodegeneration precedes CNS neurodegeneration, when the pathology is initiated in the gut--which is compatible with the known sequence of neurodegeneration evidence in human `body-first' Parkinson's disease.
To our knowledge, our aged wild-type rodent model provides the most complete recapitulation of human `body-first' Parkinson's disease reported so far, which could be relevant clinically to optimize diagnostics and therapeutics in aged patients. Such models can also be used to elucidate the nature of age-dependent interactions with a-syn pathology.

Abstract
Infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can cause severe complications in immunocompromised individuals and congenitally infected children. Characterizing heterogeneous viral populations and their evolution by high-throughput sequencing of clinical specimens requires the accurate assembly of individual strains or sequence variants and suitable variant calling methods. However, the performance of most methods has not been assessed for populations composed of low divergent viral strains with large genomes, such as HCMV. In an extensive benchmarking study, we evaluated 15 assemblers and 6 variant callers on 10 lab-generated benchmark data sets created with two different library preparation protocols, to identify best practices and challenges for analyzing such data. Most assemblers, especially metaSPAdes and IVA, performed well across a range of metrics in recovering abundant strains. However, only one, Savage, recovered low abundant strains and in a highly fragmented manner. Two variant callers, LoFreq and VarScan2, excelled across all strain abundances. Both shared a large fraction of false positive variant calls, which were strongly enriched in T to G changes in a `G.G' context. The magnitude of this context-dependent systematic error is linked to the experimental protocol. We provide all benchmarking data, results and the entire benchmarking workf low named QuasiModo, Quasispecies Metric determination on omics, under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (https://github.com/ hzi-bifo/Quasimodo), to enable full reproducibility and further benchmarking on these and other data.

Introduction
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes a lifelong infection that is typically without major clinical symptoms. After primary infection, HCMV persists latently in infected cells [1]. Primary or (re-)infections and reactivation of HCMV can cause significant morbidity and severe complications in immunocompromised individuals, such as HIV-infected persons, transplant recipients or congenitally infected children [2, 3]. HCMV has a doublestranded DNA genome of approximately 235 kb, including terminal and internal repeats, which contains at least 170 open reading frames [4]. With genome sizes of known viruses ranging from 1 kb (Circovirus SFBeef ) to 2 Mb (Pandoravirus salinus) [5], HCMV belongs to the larger known viruses and has co-evolved with its host for millions of years [6]. Multiple HCMV strain infections (i.e. with more than one strain at the same time) probably contribute to prolonged viremia, delayed viral clearance and other complications [7-10].
The establishment of high-throughput sequencing techniques and accompanying bioinformatics analysis methods has greatly advanced viral genomic research [11-16]. Assembling viral genomes of individual virus strains from a mixed population and variant calling are essential for characterizing the evolution and genetic diversity of viral pathogens such as HCMV in vivo. Although HCMV mutates and evolves more slowly than many RNA viruses and not any faster than other herpes viruses, high levels of genetic variation due to mixed (i.e. multiple) viral strain infections in an individual are often observed [17-20]. These multiple strain infections likely result from reactivation of latent strains and/or re-infections [17, 21, 22].
Assemblers leverage short read sequence data by linking sequences using kmer or read graphs, and, in some cases, variant frequencies, to reconstruct viral haplotypes, such as the recently developed HaROLD [23], which makes use of longitudinal sequence data. There are also many variant callers available, including programs for calling low-frequency variants, such as LoFreq [24], VarScan2 [25], and the commercial CLC Genomics Workbench [26]. Those programs use information on basecall and mapping quality to determine if a variant site in a read may be due to sequencing error and mapping bias or reflects true biological diversity [24-26].
A recent study on simulated and mock viromes suggests that the choice of assembler largely influences virome characterization [27]. Several assemblers that we evaluated, including IDBAUD [28], SPAdes [29], Ray [30] and Megahit [31], were previously assessed on more divergent, simulated and spiked mock viromes [27, 32]. This in one case included strains of less than 97% average nucleotide identity (ANI) [33], which resulted in shorter assemblies for low divergent community members. Viral haplotype assemblers reconstruct small viral genomes, such as HIV, Zika and hepatitis C virus, with good genome fractions. However, these may be highly fragmented, in case of Savage [34], or consist of longer contigs with a substantial amount of misassemblies, in case of PEhaplo [35], QuasiRecomb [36] and PredictHaplo [37]. Viral haplotype assemblers have so far been mostly evaluated on much smaller and more divergent genomes (genome size around 10 kb with divergence of up to 12.7%) [34, 38]. They have not been assessed on substantially larger genomes with low density of variants so far. A recent assessment of variant callers [39] reported variable, in part complementary performances of FreeBayes [40], LoFreq, VarDict [41] and VarScan2 in minority variant detection on simulated short read data from Respiratory

Syncytial Virus (RSV), which is a small virus with a 15 kb genome size.
So far, strain-level assembly and variant calling methods have not been evaluated for large DNA viruses, where runtime and memory consumption of the algorithms might also be critical, nor on benchmark data that include experimental biases of library preparation and sequencing. To investigate these issues, in the largest benchmark of its kind so far, we created and sequenced ten samples of HCMV strains with different mixing ratios and then evaluated 21 computational methods on the resulting WGS data. Analysis of these lab-created benchmark data sets allowed us to dissect the effects of computational methods and library preparation protocols.
Results
Creation and quality control of viral sequence samples
To produce a benchmark dataset of mixed viral strains, which also includes technical artifacts introduced in experimental data generation, we created viral strain mixtures mimicking clinical samples from patients with mixed strain infections in vitro. For this, we combined viral DNA of the HCMV strains TB40/E BAC4 and AD169 (designated as "TA"), derived directly from bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) with these viral genomes and prepared from Escherichia coli, or the strains TB40/E BAC4 and Merlin (designated as `TM'), which were amplified in human cell-cultures, respectively, at mixing ratios of 1:1, 1:10 and 1:50. The ANIs between each pair of those strains are around 0.977 (Table S1). In addition, pure strains were sequenced separately in each experiment, resulting in four data sets with the TB40/E and AD169 strains without target enrichment and the TB40/E and Merlin strain after enrichment. For the TA mixture experiments, we used a library preparation protocol (protocol 1, details in Material and Methods) without target enrichment and for the TM mixtures a protocol including target enrichment (protocol 2). All 10 samples (6 HCMV strain mixtures and 4 pure strains) were sequenced using 2× 300 bp paired-end sequencing (Illumina MiSeq), resulting in 1.58 million raw reads on average per sample. After quality control, 1.1 million quality reads per sample with average base quality above 30 remained.
As the HCMV strains for the TA mixtures and corresponding pure strain samples were extracted from E. coli BACs, E. coli reads were found in those samples with an average fraction of 48.6 ± 16.5% (Table S2). Based on the genome size of HCMV (235 K) and E. coli (4.6 M), the abundance of contaminating E. coli is thus around 5%. The three TM data sets and the pure Merlin strain, TM-0-1, did not include detectable bacterial contamination, but 51.7% of the reads of TM-1-0 (pure TB40/E strain) were of human origin.
Strain-resolved genome assembly
For mixed strain data sets, the ultimate aim for assembly is to recover the genomes of individual strains. To obtain a comprehensive performance overview for existing software, we evaluated the performances of the generic (meta-)genome assemblers SPAdes, metaSPAdes [42], Megahit, ABySS [43], Ray, IDBA-UD, Tadpole, which is a part of the BBMAP toolkit [44] and IVA [45], Vicuna [46], as well as the viral haplotype assemblers Savage, PredictHaplo, PEhaplo, QuasiRecomb, ShoRAH [47] and VirGenA [48] on our data sets (Material and Methods).

Figure 1. Radar plot of assembler performances with six metrics across the 10 samples. Values were scaled based on the average performance for each metric across tools and samples (best performance 1, lowest performance 0). All the metrics were calculated using the combined reference statistics from MetaQuast, except for NGA50, which is only available in genome-specific report. The NGA50 is the average NGA50 for individual genomes and samples.
Assemblies were assessed based on common assembly quality metrics with metaQUAST [49], such as genome fraction, duplication ratio, largest alignment and NGA50 using both strain genomes as references for the respective mixtures (Methods, Figure 1). The genome fraction is defined as the fraction of the reference genome covered by at least one contig. The duplication ratio is the number of bases of the reference genome covered, divided by the total number of aligned bases from the assembly. The largest alignment is the size of the biggest contig that aligned to the reference genome. The NGA50 value of an assembly is calculated by first sorting the aligned contigs, after being split at misassembly events, by size in descending order and returning the length of the contig that exceeds 50% genome fraction. If an assembler fails to produce 50% genome fraction, the NGA50 value cannot be calculated and was set to 0 kb. To further summarize the performance of assemblers on the HCMV datasets, we defined a composite quality metric for strainresolved assembly performances, consisting of a weighted score combining the metaQUAST assembly metrics `duplication ratio', `genome fraction', `largest alignment', `NGA50', `number of contigs' and `number of mismatches per 100 kb' (Materials and Methods). In this weighted score, we considered genome fraction and largest alignment the most important metrics, since they reflect the ability of the assembler to reconstruct individual strains and the completeness of the largest assembly.
All programs reconstructed the genome sequence much better for the dominant than for the minor strain. With the weighted summary score, metaSPAdes achieved the highest score (8.95), with a large genome fraction assembled (73.8 ± 19.8% versus 64.7 ± 30.2% for IVA, mean ± standard deviation) and second best for largest alignment (145.9 ± 56.6 kb), NGA50 (102.3 ± 69.0 kb), third best for number of contigs (12.4 ± 9.1) and duplication ratio (1.01 ± 0.01) (Figure 1, Tables S3 and S4). Next were IVA (8.56), which was ranked best for largest alignment, NGA50, and second best for number of contigs, and ABySS (7.87) (Figure 1, Tables S3

and S4). IVA produced on average the second fewest (8.1 ± 7.9), and longest contigs (159.6 ± 77.8 kb), especially for abundant strains (160.8 ± 72.3 kb) (1/0, 50/1, 10/1), with only very few parts of the genomes covered multiple times (duplication ratio of 1.01 ± 0.03) (Figures 1 and 2, Table S3). The Tadpole assembly had the lowest duplication ratio (1.001 ± 0.001) and the fewest mismatches per 100 kb (18.5 ± 39.8, Figures 1 and 2, Table S3). However, this was mainly because it assembled very little data and generated short contigs (NGA50 12.4 ± 15.8 kb) that covered just half (52.9 ± 38.0%) of the underlying genomes.
Megahit reconstructed overall the largest fraction of genomes on average (79.8 ± 16.5% genomes fraction) but with a high level of duplication (1.7 ± 0.6) and mismatches per 100 kb (1715 ± 1684). The haplotype assembler Savage in referencebased mode recovered the second most (79.1 ± 20.0% genome fraction) of both strains, even for the low abundant ones (Figure 2). However, it produced shorter contigs (largest contig length 21.5 ± 22.8 kb) and many duplicates (1.38 ± 0.23).
The reference-based assembler VirGenA recovered most (95.8 ± 3.4%) of the genome sequence for the dominant strains, followed by Megahit (93.5 ± 5.7%), SPAdes (93.4 ± 2.4%), ABySS (92.7 ± 3.2%) and Ray (91.6 ± 7.8%), however much less for the low abundant strains (0%, 38.3 ± 20.0%, 35.2 ± 6.6%, 37.3 ± 14.5%, 12.2 ± 4.5%, respectively). MetaSPAdes and IVA also recovered a relatively large fraction (83.4 ± 28.2% and 86.4 ± 21.2%, respectively) of the dominant strains, but only little (38.7 ± 28.4% and 8.5 ± 6.0%, respectively) of the genome for low abundant strains.
All other haplotype assemblers, i.e. Savage in de novo mode, PredictHaplo, PEhaplo, QuasiRecomb and ShoRAH, assembled no contigs and were terminated after running for more than 10 days using 24 CPU cores. Furthermore, we also tested 1000 random weights sets to calculate the summary score, and the top two assemblers (metaSPAdes and IVA) maintained this ranking for 850 out of 1000 sets. This suggests that the assemblers with good performance deliver a high-quality assembly across most metrics.
As genome assembly can be computationally intensive and time-consuming, we also benchmarked the disk space consumption (IO output), memory (maximum memory requirement) and run time of the different algorithms. Ray and ABySS used less than 30 MB for the output while IVA, SPAdes, metaSPAdes and Savage consumed more than 20 GB of disk space for output or intermediate output (Figure 3). Megahit was the most memory efficient assembler, using less than 1 GB memory, whereas ABySS, VirGenA, Savage and Vicuna consumed more than 10 GB. As to the run times, Megahit required around 10 mins for each assembly, while Vicuna and Savage needed more than 20 h with 24 threads on a server with 62 2.4GHZ CPUs, 200 TB disk space and 1 TB memory.
Variant calling
We evaluated the variant callers LoFreq, VarScan2, the low frequency variant caller of the CLC genomics workbench, BCFtools [50], FreeBayes and the GATK HaplotypeCaller [51] on the six mixed strain and four pure strain (three different strains, details in material and methods) WGS samples. A ground truth was generated by pairwise genome alignment of the respective strains with MUMmer [52] (Methods, Figure 4), which identified around 3500-4000 variants, including 200 short insertions and deletions (InDels). Sites in these genomes were then classified as variant or nonvariant in this alignment, and compared to predicted variants, to determine true positive (TP), false negative (FN) and false positive (FP) calls. Since the major strain in each

Figure 2. Performance of nine genome assemblers and one haplotype assembler (Savage) in reconstructing HCMV strains from mixed sequence samples. In the two mixture types, HCMV strains AD169 and Merlin are the high abundant strains, respectively, and TB40/E is less abundant, at ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:50. Boxplots display the median (black line) and interquartile range of individual assembly quality metrics (panels A-F) across the 10 data sets. `metaSPAdes' is abbreviated as `metaSPA'. Strain genomes are denoted by their abundances in individual mixtures. For instance, 1/10 (blue) indicates the low abundant strain in the 1:10 mixture (i.e. TB40/E in TA-1-10 and TM-1-10), and 10/1 (purple) represents the abundant strain in the 1:10 mixture (i.e. AD169 and Merlin in TA-1-10 and TM-1-10, respectively). The best assembler for each metric is marked in bold red. To illustrate the performance of assemblers on each strain in the mixture with different abundance ratios, we used genome-specific reports here from metaQUAST. It should be noted that contrary to the combined reference statistics above (Figure 1), genome-specific estimates are based on nonunique mappings over the entire set of reference genomes with metaQUAST even when using the unique option, which leads to minor discrepancies in metrics, such as increased genome fraction, duplication ratio and number of mismatches.

mixture was used as reference, we could evaluate the performance of those variant callers in identifying low frequency variants originating from the minor strain in the mixture, with the

expected low frequency variants being 2 and 10%, respectively,

in the mixtures with ratios of 1:50 and 1:10. Variant calls for

which a false nucleotide was predicted for a variant site were

also considered as FPs. Based on the number of TP, FN and FPs,

we calculated precision, recall and the F1-score as detection

quality metrics for each caller and sample. Precision, or purity,

reflects the fraction of predicted variants that are true variants:

allow a comparison based on a single metric, the F1-score is

Applying the commonly used cutoff of 20 for Phred

quality scores (QUAL) [53] for accepting predicted variants,

we evaluated the performance of variant callers on single

nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). LoFreq achieved the best

average precision (0.940 ± 0.011) and VarScan2 the highest

recall (0.872 ± 0.050, Figure 5A, Table S5) across mixture samples.

LoFreq and VarScan2 consistently performed best across sam-

ples, with average F1-scores, of 0.890 ± 0.009 and 0.880 ± 0.011,

(164 ± 59 and 381 ± 163). Notably, of these FPs in mixtures, 70.7 ± 17.3% (based on LoFreq predictions) and 37.6 ± 7.9% (based on VarScan2) were shared (Figure S3). This significant overlap (Fisher's exact test P-value <2.2 × 10-16, odds ratio 3416.8 ± 1601.1), indicates a systematic shared bias regardless of variant callers. Variant calling (Figure S4) indicated that allele frequencies intended by dilutions were closely reached with protocol 2 (TM mixture) and differed slightly more for protocol 1 (TA mixture).

Figure 4. Schematic presentation of the variant calling benchmark. Mixed samples include two HCMV strains at different abundance ratios. A genome alignment of the two strains was used to generate the ground truth, defining divergent and conserved sites, denoted by G (`genomic difference') and G (`no genomic difference'), respectively. Based on the caller, sites were classified as predicted variants C, or predicted conserved C, defining true positive (TP, in blue), false positive (FP, in red) and false negative (FN, in orange) variant calls. If a variant was called that differed from the ground truth variant, this was also considered a FP.
respectively (Figure 5B, Table S5). CLC had a slightly lower F1score (0.806 ± 0.025), and was more variable in performance across samples, while BCFtools, GATK and Freebayes performed poorly (F1-score: 0.166 ± 0.288, 0.261 ± 0.388 and 0.289 ± 0.428, respectively), particularly due to low recall (0.122 ± 0.230, 0.215 ± 0.338 and 0.253 ± 0.386). Across all strains and abundance ratios tested, LoFreq consistently performed well, while VarScan2 was consistent across abundance ratios but performed differently for the two strain mixtures (varied in precision) and CLC's recall dropped dramatically for mixture TM-1-50. BCFtools, GATK and FreeBayes performed poorly in comparison for all samples, and for highly diluted samples, their recall was almost 0. To analyze the effect of their returned Phred quality scores on variant callers' performances, we evaluated both SNPs and InDels called with different thresholds for their quality scores using a recall-precision curve. LoFreq had the best recall-precision balance followed by VarScan2 and CLC, while FreeBayes demonstrated high performance on samples TA-1-1 and TM-1-1 (Figure S1). To compare variant caller performances under optimized performance conditions, we also determined performances of variants called using the best F1-scores over these different settings across all samples. Notably, the performance of FreeBayes increased substantially, and that of CLC slightly, while the performances of other methods remained similar (Figure 5C and D, Figure S2, Table S6).
The callers achieving good recall, LoFreq, CLC and VarScan2, identified around 2400 to 2700 shared true positive SNPs from all mixed strain samples when using a quality score threshold of 20 (Figure 6). On the pure strain samples, where no SNPs were expected, LoFreq and VarScan2 predicted 61 ± 33 and 71 ± 42 FPs, respectively, substantially less than for the mixed strain samples

Genomic context of variant calls
We analyzed whether there was a specific genomic signal associated with variant calls, considering separately correct and false calls using mutational context analysis [54-56]. Focusing exemplarily on LoFreq, this approach analyzes the frequency of a certain SNP together with its sequence context, specifically the flanking3' and 5 bases. For the predictions of a certain caller, the genomic context of the six substitution types (C to A, C to G, C to T, T to A, T to C and T to G) was calculated with the R package SomaticSignatures [56] for the six mixtures and four pure strain samples (2 samples of TB40/E, 1 of Merlin, and 1 of AD169). Since the analysis is not strand-specific, the above were considered equivalent with G to T, G to C, G to A, A to T, A to G and A to C, respectively. We observed a strong, contextindependent preference for C to T or T to C transitions (with a fraction of 0.803 ± 0.016 of all variant calls across samples; top panel of Figure 7A and B), which was even more pronounced for the true positives (middle panel of Figure 7A and B), but not for FPs. For variants observed across pairwise combinations of 30 E. coli and 30 HIV genomes, which were obtained from NCBI RefSeq database (Table S7), respectively, we observed concordant results (Figures S5 and S6). For these data, transitions accounted for 0.716 ± 0.058 and 0.681 ± 0.017 of variants between genome pairs, respectively.
We found a pronounced context-dependent signal for FP calls of LoFreq and VarScan2. Here, T to G variants in a G.G context correspond mostly to FPs in the TA and TM mixtures (57.1 ± 10.0% and 86.8 ± 18.3%, respectively; bottom panel of Figure 7A and B). This enrichment is highly significant (P-value <0.0001, Fisher's exact test), with an odds ratio of around 45.2 for the TM mixture; i.e. T to G calls are 45.2 times more frequent in this context than in others and 19.9 more frequent for the TA mixture. For false variant calls on the pure Merlin and AD169 samples, T to G calls in a G.G context were even more dominant. For LoFreq on the pure Merlin (TM-0-1) sample, the genomic context pattern of false calls is highly correlated with the context pattern of FPs for all mixed strain samples, with an average Pearson correlation of 0.903 (P-value < 0.0001). For the AD169 strain and respective mixtures, this correlation (Pearson) is lower, on average 0.697, but still highly significant (P-value < 0.0001).
The allele frequencies of the FP LoFreq variants were substantially lower than those of the true positive variants (Figure S7, Wilcoxon test P-value < 2.2 × 10-16), except for the TA-1-50 sample, which had the highest-level E. coli cloning vector contamination. False T to G calls in a G.G context had a lower frequency than other false calls (P-value 1.181 × 10-10 for TM mixtures: Figure S8, 8.16 × 10-10 for TA mixtures). The allele frequency of those FP SNPs was slightly lower in protocol 2 (TM, 0.0237 ± 0.0522) than in protocol 1 (TA, 0.0242 ± 0.0121) with a Wilcoxon P-value = 0.000559, 95% CI = [0.00363, 0.0120]. The extent of the signal differed between samples created with different protocols. Though the overall FP rate was similar, the context-dependent false calls T to G in G.G doubled in protocol

Materials and methods
Creation and sequencing of HCMV strain mixtures
We created mixtures for two pairs of strains: `TB40/E BAC4' with `AD169 subclone HB5' (TA) and TB40/E BAC4 with strain Merlin (TM). For each strain pair, mixtures with three different mixing ratios, 1:1, 1:10 and 1:50, were created. Accordingly, strains `AD169' and `Merlin' are the dominant strains in the mixtures, and their genomes were used as reference for variant calling in mixed samples. In addition, the pure strains were sequenced. The name of the mixture specifies the included strains and the mixing ratio. For instance, a mixture of TB40/E and Merlin with a ratio of 1:10 is denoted by TM-1-10. Pure strain samples are denoted as TA-1-0 for TB40/E and TA-0-1 for AD169, which were

created with protocol 1 (details, see below), as well as TM-1-0 for TB40/E and TM-0-1 for Merlin, created with protocol 2.
Two protocols were used to generate the sequencing libraries. In protocol 1, the DNA of TA mixtures (TA-1-1, TA-1-10 and TA1-50) and pure strain samples (TA-0-1, TA-1-0) was extracted from the BAC host E. coli strain GS1783 using the Plasmid Midi Kit (Macherey Nagel). Library preparation was performed using an Ultra II FS-Kit from NEB according to the standard protocol from the manufacturer. Fragmentation time was 10 mins and the library was amplified 4 cycles for the mixtures and 5 cycles for the pure BACs, multiplexed and sequenced on a MiSeq (Illumina) using reagent kit v3 to generate 2 × 300 bp paired-end reads.
Protocol 2 was used to generate the TM mixture data sets (TM-1-1, TM-1-10, TM-1-50) and the pure strain samples data sets (Merlin, TM-0-1 and TB40/E BAC4, TM-1-0). The HCMV strains TB40/E BAC4 and Merlin were isolated from cell cultures. The library preparation was performed as we previously described [20] with the KAPA library preparation kit (KAPA Biosystems, USA) with a few modifications. After PCR preamplification (6-14 cycles) with adapter-specific primers,

Evaluating assembly and variant calling software for strain-resolved analysis of large DNA-viruses 7

up to 750 ng of DNA was target enriched for HCMV fragments using HCMV-specific RNA baits. HCMV-enriched libraries were indexed, amplified (17 to 20 cycles) using TruGrade oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies), multiplexed and sequenced on a MiSeq (Illumina) using reagent kit v3 to generate 2 × 300 bp paired-end reads.
Quality control of the sequencing data
Sequencing reads produced by the MiSeq sequencer were quality-controlled using fastp v0.19.4 [58]. Fastp is an all-inone FASTQ data preprocessing toolkit with functionalities including quality control, adapter detection, trimming, error correction, sequence filtering and splitting. The remaining adapter sequences were clipped from the raw reads as well as bases at the 5 or 3 of the reads with a base quality score of less than 20. Reads shorter than 130 bp after trimming were removed. The remaining PhiX sequences (originating from the Illumina PhiX spike-in control) were also removed from the dataset by mapping all quality-controlled reads against the PhiX reference genome downloaded from Illumina using BWA-MEM v0.7.17 [59]. Contamination from E. coli and the human host were also removed using the same method.
Consensus assembly and evaluation
To benchmark the performance of commonly used assemblers, we evaluated SPAdes v3.12.0 (with kmer sizes: 21, 33, 55, 77, 99, 127 and --careful option), metaSPAdes v3.12.0 (kmer sizes: 21, 33, 55, 77, 99, 127), Megahit v1.1.3 (kmer sizes: 21, 41, 61, 81, 101, 121, 141, 151), Ray (kmer size: 31), ABySS v2.1.4 (kmer size: 96), IDBA v1.1.3 (default settings), Tadpole v37.99 (default settings), IVA v1.0.9 (default settings) and Vicuna v1.3 (default settings). The quality of the resulting contigs or scaffolds was then assessed with metaQUAST v5.0.2. Only contigs longer than 500 bp were taken into account. Since the reference genomes of those strains are highly similar, with an ANI around 98%, only

unique mappings were considered in the assessment, i.e. not allowing a single contig to map to both reference genomes in the combined reference report. The metrics include the overall number of aligned contigs, the largest alignment, genome fraction, duplicate ratio, NGA50, number of mismatches per 100 kb. Here, `largest alignment' refers to the largest contig or scaffold that mapped to the reference genome. `Genome fraction' represents the fraction of the genome recovered by contigs from an assembly. The `duplication ratio' is the total number of aligned bases in the assembly divided by the total number of those in the reference (https://github.com/ablab/quast). NGA50 is the N50 value of the contigs that mapped to the reference genomes with contigs being split at misassemblies. The NGA50 value cannot be calculated for the assemblies which recover less than 50% of the genome in terms of genome fraction and was set to 0 instead to ensure comparability. The individual reference report from metaQUAST was used to evaluate the performance for abundant or low abundant strains in mixtures. All overall metrics values regardless of the specific strain in the mixture were calculated using the combined reference report from metaQUAST, except for NGA50.
Haplotype reconstruction
Of viral quasispecies assemblers, we ran PEHaplo v0.1, PredictHaplo v0.4, Savage v0.4.0, QuasiRecomb v1.2, ShoRAH v1.9.95 and VirGenA v1.4 with single reference mode using default settings (for details see the code repository). We did not run HaROLD, as this requires longitudinal clinical samples from the same source. The haplotype assemblies were evaluated using metaQUAST together with the consensus assemblies mentioned above.
A composite quality metric for strain-resolved assembly
To summarize assembly performances, we defined a weighted score based on the metaQUAST assembly metrics using combined reference including genome fraction, largest alignment,

The 16 mutation contexts for each mutation type are indicated once for the box in the lower right.

NGA50, duplication ratio, number of contigs and number of mismatches per 100 kb. As NGA50 is not available in the combined reference report of metaQUAST, we used the average NGA50 based on individual genomes from the individual references report. Of these metrics, we considered genome fraction and largest alignment as the most important metrics, since they reflect the ability of the assembler to reconstruct individual strains. To calculate a weighted summary score for assembler performance, we weighted the above metrics by the factors 0.3,

0.3, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1 and 0.1 (genome fraction, largest alignment, NGA50, duplication ratio, number of contigs and number of mismatches per 100 kb), respectively. The score of an assembler with metric i was formulated based on the scale average performance spi and then multiplied by a factor of 10 to ensure the score is in the range of 0-10:
scorei = 10 × weighti × spi,

Evaluating assembly and variant calling software for strain-resolved analysis of large DNA-viruses 9

where spi is the scaled performance for metric i. The value was scaled into 0-1 with min-max normalization defined as follows:

spi =

mpaix--mminin , mmaxax--mpiin ,

if p bigger better if p smaller better

In the formula, pi is the average performance across all samples of the given assembler for metric i, and the min and max are the smallest and largest average performance value on metric i among all assemblers.

Determination of genome differences between two strains
MUMmer v3.23 with default setting was used to align two genomes of the strains in each mixture and to identify the differences between genomes as ground truth. Command `showsnps' of the MUMmer package was employed to determine the SNPs and short InDels differing between two aligned genomes with parameter setting `--CTHr', where the repeat regions were masked. The genomic differences between TB40/E and Merlin were considered as the ground truth variants for the TM mixtures, while differences between TB40/E and AD169 were considered as the ground truth for the TA mixtures.

Variant calling
Quality-controlled reads were mapped against the reference genome of the HCMV strains Merlin and AD169 using BWA-MEM with a seed length of 31. HCMV Merlin and AD169 genomes were used as reference genomes, as they were the major strains in all mixtures. The resulting BAM files were deduplicated with the Picard package (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) to remove possible amplification duplicates that may bias the allele frequency of identified variants. To compare the performance of different variant callers, we used LoFreq (parameter: -q 20 -Q 20 -m 20), VarScan2 (--min-avg-qual 20 --P-value 0.01), FreeBayes (--p 1 -m 20 -q 20 -F 0.01 --min-coverage 10), CLC (overall read depth 10, average basecall quality 20, forward/reverse read balance 0.1-0.9 and variant frequency 0.1%), BCFtools (--p 0.01 --ploidy 1 -mv -Ob) and GATK HaplotypeCaller (--min-basequality-score 20 -ploidy 1) to identify variants. The variants from the difference between genomes detected by MUMmer were considered as positive variants. Based on this standard, precision, recall and F1-score were computed to evaluate those callers. The pairwise genome differences of 30 E. coli or 30 HIV genomes were determined by MUMmer as well. To evaluate the performance of different callers for SNP and InDel prediction, the command vcfeval in RTG-tools [60] was used to generate recall-precision curves based on the Phred scaled `QUAL' score field (--squash-ploidy -f QUAL --sample ALT).

Discussion and conclusions
Mixed infections with multiple HCMV strains are commonly observed in patients with active HCMV replication [10, 17-20]. Accurately reconstructing the genomic sequences of the individual haplotypes has implications for gaining a deeper understanding of viral pathogenicity and viral diversity within the host. To identify the most suitable software for analysis of mixed viral genome sequencing samples with low evolutionary divergence and comparatively large genomes, we evaluated multiple state-of-the-art assemblers and variant callers on lab-generated strain mixtures of HCMV.
In the assembly benchmarking, most metagenome and genome assemblers, in particular metaSPAdes and IVA, recovered the abundant strains well in terms of metrics such as genome fraction, contig length and mismatches. When also considering strains of low abundance, Savage recovered the largest fractions of both underlying genomes in the referencebased mode. However, this was achieved in a highly fragmented manner, consistent with reports by the authors (Table 3, [34]). Thus, the state-of-the-art assembly methods, including both generic (meta-)genome and specialized viral quasispecies assemblers, do not yet reconstruct large viral HCMV genomes of low abundance and low variant density with high quality. This may not be surprising since these programs were originally designed primarily for mixtures of large and much more divergent microbial genomes, or for viral genomes with a tenth of the size of the HCMV genome, but a higher variant density. In terms of resource usage, Ray and ABySS produced the smallest outputs, while Megahit was the most memory efficient, as well as fastest assembler with good performance (weighted score > 5).
Of the variant callers, LoFreq most faithfully identified only true variants across all samples, closely followed by VarScan2. Both had high F1-scores even on the samples with high mixing ratios. When analyzing the genomic context of the predicted variants, for true positive calls, we observed a contextindependent enrichment of T to C and C to T transitions. A preference for transitions over transversions is common in molecular evolution [61, 62]. This is the case in terms of observed mutations and because transitions more often lead to synonymous mutations that tend to be neutral, rather than under negative selection, as most nonsynonymous changes on the population level.
For false variant calls, we found a striking enrichment of T to G changes in a G.G context, representing an unreported context-dependent signal. Calls with this pattern had lower allele frequencies than true positive variant calls and were more pronounced in sample with more PCR cycles used (protocol 2, 6-14 cycles versus 4 in protocol 1), indicating a link to DNA amplification. Amplification error introduced in PCR cycles will accumulate exponentially and occur at frequencies that depend on when they were introduced: PCR-induced errors are mostly of lower frequency unless introduced in one of the very early amplification cycles [57]. Schirmer and co-workers studied the error profiles for the amplicon sequencing using MiSeq with different library preparation methods and showed that the library preparation method and the choice of primers are the most significant sources of bias and cause distinct error patterns [63]. They also observed a run-specific preference for the substituting nucleotide. They observed that A and C were more prone to substitution errors (A to C and C to A) compared to G and T, which differ from our results. We could not find the contextdependent signal for an HIV quasispecies data set that had

10 Deng et al.

been generated with Nextera XT DNA Library Prep chemistry (Illumina) on Illumina's MiSeq platform, suggesting that the FP pattern originates from a step unique to the HCMV sequencing protocol, such as preamplification and amplification PCR during library preparation.
Notably, the experimental protocols substantially affected the nature of the generated data and bioinformatics results. Protocol 1 led to substantial amplification of E. coli host DNA and thus lower coverage of the viral strains. This, together with the resulting differences in actual mixing ratios relative to protocol 2 likely explain the higher recall and slightly lower precision observed in variant detection (Figure S4). An earlier study based on simulated sequencing data also showed that variant calling on lower coverage samples achieved higher recall and lower precision [64]. Protocol 2 used more extensive DNA amplification together with cultivation in human cell culture. This resulted in higher coverage of viral strain genomes in comparison to protocol 1, and the doubling of context-dependent FP variant calls within a G.G context discussed above (Figure 7, Figure S10, S11).
Taken together, our results suggest that for strain mixtures of large DNA viruses with low variant density, many assemblers reconstruct the abundant strain with high quality, but assembly of the low abundant strains is still challenging. Variant callers designed for low frequency variant detection provided the best results and detected most true variants. These findings are relevant for the interpretation of program outputs when analyzing clinical patient samples. We also provide a resource that facilitates further benchmarking, including our result evaluation and visualization software QuasiModo, all produced benchmarking data sets and results, for flexible assessment of further methods on these and similar data sets.
Key Points · The strain-resolved de novo assembly of large DNA virus with low variant density is challenging to all evaluated assemblers. Some generic (meta-) genome assemblers, such as metaSPAdes and IVA, performed particularly well in recovering the dominant strain. · LoFreq and VarScan2 are good choices for identifying low frequency variants from a strain mixture of large DNA viruses. · The pattern of false variant calls likely links to the experimental protocol used to generate the sequencing data. More amplification cycles led to more pronounced FP variant calls. · All the analyses can be reproduced using QuasiModo developed in this study. QuasiModo can be also utilized to evaluate other methods using the benchmarking data sets in this study or similar data sets.

SUMMARY We report two cases of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) which had a very good response to a treatment with lenvatinib at 14 mg. A 73-y­ ear-o­ ld man with ATC stage IVB was operated on, undergoing a near-t­otal thyroidectomy, and the pathological remnant tissue showed a quick and partial response to treatment with the drug. The patient had a single metastasis in the brain after 9 months, but then died due to bronchopneumonia after undergoing a neurosurgical intervention for the complete removal of the lesion. A 74-­year-o­ ld woman with ATC stage IV was operated on, undergoing a near-­ total thyroidectomy after a neoadjuvant treatment with the drug, that was continued after surgical treatment. She had a partial remission of the local disease and of distant metastasis, which lasted for 14 months. She then died 4 months later due to cancer progression. Lenvatinib at 14 mg appears to be effective, fast and well tolerated.

BACKGROUND Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is rare, but is one of the most aggressive cancers in humans. The standard treatment is surgical intervention, when possible, plus chemotherapy and accelerated hyper-­ fractionated external beam radiotherapy (EBR), usually in combination. 1 2 Despite this aggressive approach, prognosis is severe, and most of these cancers are metastatic at the initial diagnosis. Recently, targeted multi-t­yrosine kinase (MTK) inhibitors have appeared to represent a further possibility for treatment to offer to these patients, and one of these, lenvatinib, has been approved in Japan for ATC (3-8). However, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in these patients, although dependent on stage, are still usually poor as regards any type of treatment, and, in fact, prognosis has not changed much over the last few years. We report an unusually long PFS and OS in two consecutive patients treated with a low-­ intermediate dose (14 mg) of lenvatinib, and speculate about possible explanations.

(figure 1). An ultrasonography confirmed a mass of 7.0 in maximum size in the left lobe and isthmus with a suspected lymph node metastases. A fine needle aspiration (FNA) was suspicious for ATC. The patient, after stoppage of everolimus, was sent for surgical treatment, and it was possible to perform a near-t­otal thyroidectomy, leaving some paratracheal pathological tissue. The histology was: ATC with maximum size 7.5 cm involving the left and right lobe with spindle growth pattern, infiltrating perithyroidal muscles and oesophagus (immunophenotypic investigation showed CKAM

Considering the general clinical context, after obtaining written consent for an off-l­abel treatment, we decided to treat the patient with lenvatinib, and we chose as first line a medium-­low dosage of 14 mg, which was initiated 7 days after the surgical intervention.

Molecular analysis of tumour pathological tissue was performed, and the data are reported in table 1.
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP After 3weeks we performed a first (18-­fluorodeoxyglucose (18-­ FDG)) PET/CT, which showed a pathological tissue remnant with SUV 5.1 (figure 2). Ultrasonography showed only a small paratracheal pathological remnant tissue. Another (18FDG) CT/PET performed at 4 and 8 months, showed only minimal remnant tissue in the neck with a further reduced uptake, SUV

During staging, the patient showed not only a visible increase of the mass in the neck, but also a worsening of well-b­ eing, with diffuse pain in the chest and rapid deterioration of her clinical status. The patient was referred for surgical treatment, but she refused it, knowing the poor prognosis of the disease and the possibility that the intervention could be only a debulking with positioning of a tracheal cannula.

Case report
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP We decided, after written consent, for the off-l­abel use of lenvatinib, and we started the drug at 14 mg/day. At that moment ECOG was 1/2. The patient did not show side effects, and experienced some improvement in quality of life in the first week regarding pain in the chest. A CT scan performed after 3weeks showed a decrease in the mediastinal mass (figure 6). At this point we exerted great effort to convince the patient to submit to surgical treatment, and she agreed. The histology showed an ATC with a maximum size of 7 cm infiltrating perithyroid muscle TTF1, thyroglobulin, CD30 negative; CKCAM 5.2 positive, pT3bNxcM1 TNM 2017 8th edition stage IVC. During the following months, imaging showed a progressive remission of the disease up to almost complete remission (figures 7 and 8). After 14 months she experienced recurrence with unilateral palsy, and a CT scan showed progressive disease in the mediastinum and chest. Subsequently, the patient developed bilateral recurrent palsy, and underwent a tracheostomy. Exitus occurred after 4 months.
DISCUSSION ATC is one of the most malignant solid tumours in humans. The prognosis is usually so poor that there is not any real guideline regarding treatment, although surgical intervention is usually considered the first line of treatment.1 2 It can have a debulking aim, or, rarely, offer a possibility of radicality in less advanced cases, and sometimes surgical treatment can follow an attempt of neoadjuvant medical treatment. The type of medical treatment, alone or combined with EBR, still represents a matter for discussion, and among medical treatments, some MTK inhibitors, already approved for iodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, have garnered interest. Among these, lenvatinib is known to be directed against FGR 1, 2, 3, 4; VEGFR 1, 2, 3; PDGFRb; RET and c-K­ it, and it has been successfully employed in iodine refractory thyroid cancer.3 Lenvatinib has been approved also for treatment of ATC, in Japan in 2015, and there are now several reports regarding this drug.4-9 However, in advanced stages IVB and IVC, as in our cases, the PFS and OS are usually poor. The various published papers have shown a median of PFS and OS ranging, respectively, from 4.0 to 4.2,5 and 7.4 to 10.6 months.5 6 The best results appear to be those of a phase II study.5 6 However, in this study a partial response was seen in only 24% of cases, and only 4 patients out of 17 were able to complete the study, either because they did not show a response, or because they developed severe side effects to the treatment at the initial dose of 24 mg. In this last study, the patients enrolled had as a criterion of inclusion that they were expected to survive at least 8 weeks or more after the first dose of lenvatinib, so we must also suppose that their clinical condition was not so bad. The stage for all patients was between IVA and IVC, but it was not reported which cases were able to finish the study and showed the best results.
Our cases offer interesting points for speculation. In our first case, we had a PFS of 8 months, and the recurrence of disease was in the brain. There are no data regarding the crossing of lenvatinib through the blood-brain barrier, but as regards other MTK inhibitors we can suppose a reduced transfer in the brain, and therefore a reduced concentration and activity at this level.10-13 On the other hand, no locoregional recurrences in other sites of the body were present. Rather, lenvatinib appeared to exert very good locoregional control, inasmuch as CT/PET showed a very remarkable reduction of FDG uptake in the neck. The overall survival was 10.2 months, but it could have been much longer if

the patient had not passed away because of bronchopneumonia, due likely to the immunosuppressive treatment, since the neurosurgical intervention removed completely the metastasis. The second case appears even more surprising, considering the stage and the general clinical condition. We had a PFS of 14 months, with an OS of 18 months, and a partial remission which came very near to a complete remission. Both patients tolerated quite well the starting dose of 14 mg, considering the fact that the side effects were related to the dose and to the serum levels.14-16
An initial speculation could be that in the complex mechanism of the regulation of the various MTK cascades, there could exist a specific, most effective dose, beyond which a hook effect occurs, and the efficacy may decrease. Although data in vitro show that the effects on ATC cells of lenvatinib are dose dependent,17 18 no study, in point of fact, reports if there might exist something like this hook effect for an increasing dose of the drug. If we analyse all the cases reported in the literature, we find only two cases comparable both for advanced stage and for PFS (9.0 and 27.9 months)3; also in these series some patients were treated with 14 mg for a progressive reduction of the drug, but, unfortunately, in that paper it is not specified which dose these two cases were treated with.
We could also speculate that in our cases we enjoyed such a good response because the dose of lenvatinib was not very high, and was hence well tolerated by the patients, who could continue without important side effects, being that side effects were related to the oral dose.14-16 However, the response was not only long-l­asting, but also fast, showing powerful activity of the 14 mg of lenvatinib. Regarding the first hypothesis, that there is the possibility that this intermediate dose might exert some special activity on ATC, studies in vitro will help to show the dose/activity profile of the drug. As already stated, some studies exist showing a dose-d­ ependent activity.17 18 However, higher concentrations will have to be studied, even though we have to keep in mind that studies in vitro on ATC cells cannot represent the reality in vivo, since lenvatinib exerts a fundamental action also on the vessels by Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor .
Regarding molecular analysis, our data do not appear to show any special predictive mutation for a better response.
In conclusion, in our two consecutive cases treated by lenvatinib, we enjoyed a very good response using 14 mg. Further studies in vitro and clinical trials should be encouraged to test lenvatinib in ATC using lower doses than the standard 24 mg dose. From a practical point of view, we could suggest trying
Learning points
 Diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is usually histological. However, in special cases a cytology examination by an expert pathologist can be sufficient (case 2).
 Lenvatinib at low-­medium dosage (14 mg in our cases) has been demonstrated to be highly effective and quick in controlling the disease. Two possible explanations can be speculated on: simply that this lower dose can allow a better treatment of patients because of the absence of important side effects in such critical patients, or that an especially powerful activity of an intermediate dosage is exerted on the complex balance of multi-­tyrosine kinase cascade in ATC.
 Research in vitro and clinical trials could help to elucidate the hypothesis that a lower dosage could be more effective than a full standard dose in this cancer.
 Lenvatinib can have a neoadjuvant role (case 2).

to use this particular dose (14 mg) as a starting dose in such critical patients with ATC, since the drug is effective, the action is fast, and side effects are seen to be less frequent and more manageable.

ABSTRACT
The 35delG mutation in the gap junction protein, b2, 26kDa (GJB2) gene is the most common mutation that has been found in children with non syndromic hearing loss. Testing for the GJB2 gene mutation is simple and can directly answer the concerns of the parents about cause of the disorder and prognosis for their children. Cochlear implantation (CI) is one of the methods of hearing rehabilitation in patients with complete hearing loss. The present study was designed for genetic assessment of children who were referred for CI.
Connexin 26 (Cx26) gene analyses were performed on 42 children with non syndromic hearing loss who were referred to the Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran, Iran for genetic consultation and CI. Clinical history was obtained and an examination conducted on each individual. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and mutation identification of the Cx26 gene was performed by polymerase chain reac-

tion (PCR) amplification and direct sequencing of the coding sequence of the gene. Cochlear implantation was performed for all patients and treatment response was assessed for all of them based on speech intelligibility rating (SIR) before and after CI.
We found six patients (14.3%) with the 35delG mutation on the Cx26 gene, two homozygotes and four heterozygotes. No other mutation was detected. Treatment response in children with the homozygous 35delG mutation was better than in heterozygous patients, and treatment response in children with the mutation was better than in children with no mutation.
Mutation screening for finding deafness causing mutations in the GJB2 gene is a useful predictor of post-implantation speech perception. We suggest microarray or other advanced mutation detection methods for assessment of other genes that might be responsible for non syndromic deafness.

INTRODUCTION
In genetic assessment of hearing impairment, 46 genes and 81 genetic loci have now been identified and these numbers are increasing [1]. The 35delG mutation on the gap junction protein, b2, 26kDa (GJB2) gene is the most common mutation to be found in children

with non syndromic hearing loss and has been identified as the predominant cause of inherited sensorineural deafness [2-7]. The GJB2 gene encodes gap junction channel protein 26 [connexin 26 (Cx26)] which allows direct communication between the cells [8,9]. The Cx26 gene is one member of a family of related gap-junction channel-forming proteins, each of which is commonly named from its molecular weight (Cx26, Cx30, etc.). The genes for 20 different connexin proteins are present in the human genome [9]. Since 1990, genetic assessment of the GJB2 mutation has been performed in children with congenital hearing loss. Now, the American College of Medical Genetics (Bethesda, MD, USA) has presented genetic testing as a routine method for the evaluation of children with congenital hearing loss [10].
Between 27 to 39% of deaf children show abnormalities such as cochlear dysplasia, lateral semicircular canal dysplasia and dilated vestibular aqueduct on imaging studies [computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] [11,12]. Imaging studies are expensive and cannot suitably address the cause and prognosis of hearing loss in these children and thus cannot be accepted as the first method of choice. On the other hand, GJB2 testing is simple and can give direct answers to the parents' concern about the cause and prognosis in their children.
Cochlear implantation (CI) is one of the methods of hearing rehabilitation in patients with complete hearing loss and nowadays most children with dominant or recessive congenital hearing loss are candidates for this therapeutic method [13]. The present study had two main purposes: firstly, genetic assessment of children who were referred for CI, and secondly, to determine whether the type of mutation is an important factor in treatment of the studied children.

ototoxic drugs and looking for evidence of syndromic forms of deafness. All subjects were otoscopically examined and pure tone audiometry was performed on all subjects. Air conduction thresholds were measured at 250Hz, 500Hz, 1kHz, 2kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz and 8kHz. All probands had prelingual deafness (early-onset).
Mutation Analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using the standard phenol-chloroform methods [14]. For mutation identification in the Cx26 gene, the coding sequence of the gene was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified using primers Conn-F (5'-CTC CCT GTT CTG TCC TAG CT-3') and Conn-R (5'-CTC ATC CCT CTC ATG CTG TC-5'). The PCR conditions were 95°C for 3 min., then 32 cycles at 94°C, 59°C and 72°C, each for 45 seconds, followed by a 7 min. extension at 72°C. The PCR products were purified on agarose gel and directly sequenced using the same forward and reverse primers.
Treatment Response Assessment. Cochlear implantation was performed on all patients. Treatment response was assessed in all of them based on their speech intelligibility rating (SIR) before, and 3, 6 and 12 months after CI.
RESULTS
Mutation Detection in Our Subjects and Their Response to Cochlear Implantation. In the present study we analyzed the coding region of the Cx26 gene in 42 children with non syndromic hearing loss and found two homozygotes and four heterozygotes for the 35delG mutation (Figure 1). In other words, six patients (14.3%) had the 35delG mutation on the Cx26

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study Subjects. Connexin 26 gene analysis was performed on 42 children (20 males and 22 females, age range 4-12 years old, average 6 years old) with non syndromic hearing loss and with normal parents who were referred to Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran, Iran, for genetic consultation and CI. Clinical history was obtained and an examination conducted on each individual, with special emphasis on identifying potential environmental causes of hearing loss, such as infections, trauma, exposure to known or possible

Treatment response was assessed in all patients. According to results of SIR, it seems that treatment response in children with the mutation was better than in children with no mutation, and also treatment response in children homozygous for the 35delG mutation was better than in heterozygous patients (Figures 3 and 4).

patients had an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and according to this pattern, we expected to see deafness only in children with homozygous mutations but in four patients, the mutations were heterozygous. In their study, del Castillo et al. (19) suggested that other mutations are present in a gene or genes in the same chromosomal region. This phenomenon could be explained on the basis of either a monogenic or a digenic pattern of inheritance. In the case of a monogenic mode of inheritance, there must be a regulatory element that is essential for the expression of the GJB2 gene in the inner ear. This hypothetical element would be located far upstream of GJB2, and the deletion of this element would suppress the level of expression of the GJB2 gene enough to produce a phenotype of hearing impairment. An alternative interpretation would be that the deletion inactivates a second gene whose protein is functionally related to Cx26.
Inheritance pattern by single or double genes is responsible for this phenomenon. In our mutation assessment of the Cx26 gene, the 35delG mutation was more frequent, while in Ashkenazi Jewish subjects, the 167delT mutation was more frequent [20].

Details of SIR scores of included children before and 3, 6 and 12 months after CI are shown in Table 1.
DISCUSSION
The 35delG mutation accounts for approximately 70% of GJB2 mutant alleles in Northern and Southern European, as well as American Caucasian populations, with a carrier frequency of 2-4%. In the Iranian population this mutation accounts for approximately 12-21% of all involved mutations in autosomal recessive non syndromic hearing loss [14-18]. In our study, the Cx26 genetic defect was seen in 14.3% of the investigated children with hearing impairment. Deafness in our

Fukushima et al. [21] in their study on seven Japanese deaf children reported that better speech performance after CI may be observed in persons with GJB2-related deafness compared to children without GJB2-related deafness. Some authors such as Jun et al. [22] based on the microscopic evaluation of temporal histopathology in deaf children with GJB2 mutations concluded that a greater number of functional cells in the spiral ganglion of these children could explain their better speech performance. The GJB2 deafness phenotype is considered as typical non syndromic hearing loss and differences in their response to CI might be due to differences in higher brain function abilities [21].

CONCLUSIONS
The results of our study showed that CI is a suitable choice for treatment of children with non syndromic deafness, especially with mutations in the GJB2 gene. Mutation screening for deafness-causing mutations in the GJB2 gene is a useful predictor of postimplantation speech perception and permits better pre-implantation counseling. We suggest microarray or other advanced mutation detection methods for assessment of other genes which might be responsible for non syndromic deafness.

ABSTRACT Introduction: Health-compromising behaviours are
often acquired in adolescence. Alongside broader public health interventions, preventive interventions within primary care have the potential to encourage long-lasting behaviour change by tailoring messages to each individual. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of primary care interventions in reducing the 3 main cardiovascular risk behaviours (smoking, low physical activity and unhealthy diet) in adolescents aged 10-19 years. It is also to identify successful initiatives and ingredients for such success that could be replicated in primary care.
Methods and analysis: This systematic review of the
literature and meta-analysis will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA) recommendations. The following databases will be searched for articles published between January 1990 and December 2016: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN registry. Our search will focus on randomised and cluster randomised controlled trials of interventions conducted in primary care practices to reduce the 3 main cardiovascular risk behaviours in adolescents aged 10-19 years, compared with active (information leaflet, etc) or passive (usual care, etc) control conditions. The primary outcomes will be smoking, physical activity and diet, measured either objectively or by self-report. Secondary outcomes such as body mass index or insulin resistance will also be examined. 2 reviewers will independently screen articles, extract relevant data and assess study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A meta-analysis will be considered if the number of studies is sufficient and outcomes are sufficiently homogeneous. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria will be used to assess the quality of the evidence.
Ethics and dissemination: This systematic review
will add to our knowledge on the prevention of cardiovascular disease early in life and these findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at relevant conferences.
Study registration number: PROSPERO
CRD42016028045.

Strengths and limitations of this study
 This review will use a systematic and comprehensive approach to add to our knowledge about early prevention of cardiovascular disease in primary care.
 It will help identify successful initiatives as well as ingredients for such success in order to contribute to reducing cardiovascular risk in adolescence.
 Since this is a neglected area of prevention research, the number of high-quality studies included in the review is likely to be limited.
 A high level of heterogeneity both between interventions and outcome measurements could limit the strength of the findings emerging from this review.
INTRODUCTION In 2015, 25% of all deaths in the world are to be caused by cardiovascular disorders.1 These disorders represent the first cause of adult mortality and morbidity in high-income countries and are a growing concern in lowincome and middle-income countries as well.2 3
Health-compromising behaviours acquired in adolescence and young adulthood are major contributors to the development of cardiovascular disorders in later life.4 Thus, adolescence represents both a period of risk for the acquisition of such behaviours and a period of opportunity to prevent them. Smoking, low physical activity and unhealthy diet are the most prominent cardiovascular risk behaviours in adolescence.4 5 Findings from population-based surveys such as the HBSC-2010 survey (Health Behaviours in School-Aged Children, in more than 40 highincome and middle-income countries) show that a significant proportion of adolescents are exposed to these risk factors: at the age of 15, 20% smoke at least once a week

(up from 1% at the age of 11 years), two-thirds of adolescents have sedentary behaviours (watching television 2 or more hours a day on weekdays), more than 80% of them report <1 hour a week of moderate-to-vigorous exercise, less than a third eat fruit daily, and 10% of girls and 20% of boys are overweight or obese.6
Population approaches may be successful to improve diet, physical activity and smoking habits.7 Individual approaches at the healthcare level are also important, however, to individualise public health messages and encourage behaviour change.7 Within a life-course approach to adolescent health, primary care physicians (PCPs) are ideally placed to promote healthy lifestyles and offer preventive care that may influence young people's health well into adulthood.8 PCPs' role has been highlighted both in the WHO's report on noncommunicable diseases and in national strategies.9 10 Despite increased recognition of the added value of preventive care, evidence is needed to support its provision since preventive care is time-consuming and often financially unrewarding for practitioners.11 Until now, little focus has been placed on the effectiveness of preventive interventions in childhood to ensure ideal cardiovascular health and reduce cardiovascular risk later in life.12 We found no previous review of the evidence in relation to interventions for the prevention of the three main cardiovascular risk behaviours in adolescents attending primary care. The aim of this systematic review of the literature is therefore to determine the effectiveness of primary care interventions in reducing the three main cardiovascular risk behaviours in adolescents. Our objectives are to: 1. Identify and summarise the evidence about the
effectiveness of interventions in primary care to reduce the three main cardiovascular risk behaviours (smoking, low physical activity and unhealthy diet) in adolescents (aged 10-19 years, according to the WHO definition). 2. Identify the features associated with the effectiveness of interventions, such as communication style (eg, the use of motivational interviewing), mode of delivery (eg, entirely face to face or supported by a webbased tool), duration and frequency. 3. If possible, to measure the effect size of the interventions in reducing each of the three main cardiovascular risk behaviours.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS This protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines.13 It is registered in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42016028045).
Eligibility criteria Study characteristics Inclusion will be limited to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs (cRCTs) published in any

language (but with an abstract in English) between January 1990 and December 2015. Completed but yet unpublished trials identified through trial registration platforms will also be eligible for inclusion. Non-RCTs, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series will, however, also be considered if the number of identified RCTs is low (five or less).
Population Studies will be considered if the tested intervention targets adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 years attending a primary care practice. Studies including participants younger than 10 years will also be included if data in relation to the target age group can be analysed separately. Since young adults are often considered within a developmental continuum from adolescence into adulthood, studies involving participants up to the age of 24 years will also be eligible, as long as they also include adolescents aged between 10 and 19 years and provide data for this age group that can be considered separately.
Intervention Interventions that aim to address the three main cardiovascular risk behaviours, either alone or in combination, will be eligible. The aim of the interventions should be to reduce tobacco use, increase physical activity/reduce sedentary behaviour and/or promote a healthy diet (fulfilling criteria for a healthy diet of the American Heart Association).14 Interventions delivered by the PCP or any other professional working within the primary care practice will be considered, as well as interventions involving multimedia tools targeting patients identified in the primary care practice.
Comparator or control Studies comparing the intervention either to an active control (eg, information leaflet, intervention by specialist) or passive control (eg, usual care, waiting list, etc) will be eligible.
Outcomes Studies will be included if they assess the effect of the intervention on one or several of the following outcomes:  Smoking: objectively measured (cotinine levels) and/
or self-reported (subjective);  Physical activity/sedentary behaviour assessed either
objectively ( pedometer, etc) or subjectively, preferably using standardised tools;  Diet: objectively measured (biomarkers for dietary habits) and/or self-reported (subjective), preferably using standardised tools. Secondary outcomes: for studies of preventive interventions targeting physical activity and/or dietary habits, outcomes such as body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, blood insulin levels will also be recorded if available.

Data sources and search The following databases will be searched for articles published between January 1990 and December 2016: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN registry. We will also search the reference lists of included studies and contact authors of included studies to ask about their knowledge of any additional studies not identified in the initial search.
The search strategy will use a combination of medical subject headings (MeSH) and free-text words for the population, intervention, outcomes and study design, adapted to each database. No limits will be applied. Table 1 presents the initial keywords on which the full search strategy will be developed. A search strategy for PubMed is presented in online supplementary appendix 1.
Data management Endnote software will be used for data management. All the results of literature searches will be imported into the program and duplicates removed by the main reviewer.
Selection process Selection of relevant studies will follow the PRISMA guidelines, using a three-step process, all carried out by two reviewers, with a third reviewer available to help resolve any disagreement. All identified titles and abstracts will first be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria, and then the full texts of potentially eligible articles meeting inclusion criteria on the basis of their title/ abstract. At each step of the selection process, reasons for inclusion/exclusion will be recorded.
Data extraction Using a process similar to the one developed in a previous systematic review by our team, we will develop and

pilot test a data extraction form to record the following data: study authors, country, setting, population and participant sociodemographic characteristics, interventions and their specific features, control condition, outcomes (both subjective and objective, at all follow-up time points) and timing of measurements, and information to be used to assess risk of bias.15 Two reviewers will independently test the data extraction form on three articles and the form will then be adapted to ensure the reliability of the data extraction process. The two reviewers will then extract data for each included study independently and any disagreement will be resolved through discussion, if needed involving the third reviewer in order to reach consensus.
Missing data Attempts will be made to contact study authors via email to obtain clarification if data are incomplete in the study report and we will allow a delay of 6 weeks to receive a response following two email attempts. We do not plan to use imputation to deal with missing data.
Assessing risk of bias Two reviewers will independently assess risk of bias for each included study. They will use the tool developed by the Cochrane Collaboration to assess and report risk of bias in the following domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and researchers, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias (including conflicts of interest and study sponsorship).16 Risk of bias will be described as low, unclear or high, and reasons for each assessment will be documented.
Evidence synthesis We will produce a narrative synthesis of the data extracted from the included studies and present it in a text and summary tables. In addition to the evidence in relation to the effectiveness of different interventions, a special emphasis will be placed on presenting key components of successful interventions.
Data analysis Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise general data in particular in relation to participants and outcomes. If the number and homogeneity of retrieved studies are sufficient, we will pool outcome estimates of intervention effectiveness and conduct meta-analyses using random-effects models. Separate meta-analyses will be conducted for each of the three risk behaviour outcomes. If multiple measures are used to measure an outcome, we will favour meta-analysis of subjective measures as they are likely to be reported in the largest number of studies. However, we also plan to conduct a meta-analysis of outcomes measured objectively if these are reported in more than two studies. Long-term outcomes will be favoured over short-term outcomes for the

meta-analysis if the number of studies reporting them is sufficient. If length of follow-up is very variable, these data will be introduced as co-variates in the analyses.
Dichotomous outcomes will be presented as risk ratios with 95% CIs. For continuous outcomes, effect sizes will be presented using either weighted mean differences when similar outcome measures have been used or, if possible, standardised mean differences where different measures of a same outcome have been used.
Statistical heterogeneity will be explored using the I2 statistic. If substantial heterogeneity (I2>50%) is present and the number of included studies is sufficient, we will use subgroup analyses (eg, younger vs older adolescent participants, interventions targeting one vs several risk behaviours, single session vs multiple component intervention, etc) to attempt to identify reasons for heterogeneity. If some studies are at high risk of bias, sensitivity analyses will be conducted excluding these studies to assess the extent to which they influence the findings.
Assessment of possible reporting bias If the number of studies included in a meta-analysis is sufficient (10 studies), we will investigate possible reporting bias using funnel plots.
Assessment of the strength of the evidence The quality of the evidence in relation to the effect of interventions on the three main outcomes will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines.17 The evidence will be assessed across the following domains: design and risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision and publication bias (which includes possible role of sponsor).
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval will not be necessary as no primary patient data will be collected.
Worldwide, the increasing burden of disease due to non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, has shed light on the need to place a stronger emphasis on prevention. Interventions targeting adolescents can act at an age when risk behaviours spread their roots and have the potential to influence the health of individuals throughout their adult life. Alongside broader public health interventions, preventive interventions within primary care have the potential to encourage long-lasting behaviour change by better tailoring messages to each individual. This systematic review will add to our knowledge on the prevention of cardiovascular disease. In particular, it will help us identify evidence-based primary care interventions for adolescents for which implementation efforts should be promoted. It will allow us to identify successful initiatives and, hopefully, also ingredients for such success, as well as possible gaps in knowledge in relation to effective interventions opening paths for further research. These

findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations in relevant conferences. Our review will also serve to define a future research agenda in this as yet much neglected domain of prevention research.

ABSTRACT Objectives Large disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) management and survival have been observed across Europe. Despite recent increases, the survival deficit of Estonian patients with CRC persists, particularly for rectal cancer. The aim of this study was to examine diagnostic, staging and treatment patterns of CRC in Estonia, comparing clinical data from 1997 and 2011. Design Nationwide population-­based retrospective study. Setting Estonia. Participants All incident cases of colon and rectal cancer diagnosed in 1997 and 2011 identified from the Estonian Cancer Registry. Clinical data gathered from medical records. Outcome measures Differences in diagnostic, staging and treatment patterns; 5-­year relative survival ratios. Results The number of colon cancer cases was 337 in 1997 and 498 in 2011; for rectal cancer, the respective numbers were 209 and 349. From 1997 to 2011, large increases were seen in the use of colonoscopy and lung and liver imaging. Radical resection rate increased from 48% to 59%, but emergency surgeries showed a rise from 18% to 26% in colon and from 7% to 14% in rectal cancer. The proportion of radically operated patients with 12 lymph nodes examined pathologically increased from 2% to 58% in colon cancer and from 2% to 50% in rectal cancer. The use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy increased from 6% to 39% among stage II and from 20% to 50% among patients with stage III rectal cancer. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer increased from 42% to 63%. The 5-­year RSR increased from 50% to 58% in colon cancer and from 37% to 64% in patients with rectal cancer. Conclusions Major improvements were seen in the diagnostics, staging and treatment of CRC in Estonia contributing to better outcomes. Increase in emergency surgeries highlights possible shortcomings in timely diagnosis and treatment.
INTRODUCTION Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-­ leading cause of cancer-r­elated deaths in Europe.1 The incidence of CRC has increased, while survival rates have steadily improved in Europe as well as in Estonia.2 3 Diagnostic approaches, multimodality treatment and surgical techniques of CRC have

gone through significant changes during the past decades.4
In the EUROCARE-3 study (1990-1994), large variations in CRC survival were observed across Europe, with particularly poor rates for Eastern European countries, including Estonia.5 The 5-­year relative survival of Estonian patients was below 40% for colon and around 30% for rectal cancer, while the European average for both sites was close to 50%.5
These observed variations between different countries prompted the initiation of European High-R­esolution studies to examine the patterns of cancer care. In the late 1990s, the proportion of radically operated patients with CRC varied from 44% to 86% among the participating 12 registries with the estimate for Estonia (56%) being one of the lowest.6 Shortcomings in diagnostics were evident as the proportion of cases resected radically who had 12 lymph nodes examined was below 2% in Estonia while the European average was 29%.6 A large variation (24%-73%) was also seen in the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer.6
A more detailed analysis of the 1997 Estonian CRC cohort showed extremely low quality of pathological examination, inadequate staging and insufficient use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies.7
A recent analysis of Estonian Cancer Registry data demonstrated that both overall

and stage-­specific relative survival of CRC patients have improved significantly and the survival gap between Estonia and the leading countries in Europe has narrowed.3 From 1995-1999 to 2010-2014, the 5-­year relative survival increased the most for stage III rectal cancer (from 34% to 70%), while manyfold increase was also seen for stage IV CRC.3 It was hypothesised that more accurate diagnostics and improved treatment have contributed to these changes.
This study was undertaken to examine the changes in diagnostic, staging and treatment patterns in Estonia since late 1990s, comparing clinical data from 1997 and 2011.
MATERIAL AND METHODS Both study cohorts (1997 and 2011) were initially formed for European Cancer Registry (EUROCARE) European High-­Resolution Studies, in order to compare cancer management practices across Europe. The study cohorts were identified from the Estonian Cancer Registry, which is a population-­based registry covering the whole country (population 1.3million in 2011) and has data since 1968. All incident cases of cancer of colon ((International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) C18) and rectum (ICD-10 C19-20), diagnosed in adults (age 15 years) in 1997 and 2011 were included. Death certificate only and autopsy cases (n=16 in 1997, n=13 in 2011) were excluded.
Data on diagnostic procedures, staging and treatment were gathered retrospectively from the patients' medical records by oncologists and colorectal surgeons, according to the study protocols of EUROCARE High-R­ esolution Studies.6 8
Subsites were categorised into right-­sided colon cancer, including appendix, caecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure and transverse colon (ICD-10 C18.0-18.4); left-­ sided colon cancer, including splenic flexure, descending and sigmoid colon (C18.5-18.7); other or overlapping colon (C18.8-18.9); rectosigmoid junction (C19) and rectum (C20).
The stage (I-IV) was classified according to the tumour, nodes, metastases (TNM) Classification V.7 based on the algorithm shown in online supplemental table 1. Pathological TNM was used for staging primarily operated cases. If pathological TNM was missing or patients received neoadjuvant treatment, clinical TNM stage was used for the 2011 cohort. The 1997 study protocol did not include data collection on clinical T and N stage.
Surgical treatment was categorised as no surgery, radical surgery, not radical surgery, unknown as shown in online supplemental table 1.
The equality of proportions in the 1997 and 2011 cohorts was tested with two-s­ample tests of proportions using large-­sample statistics in STATA V.14 (StataCorp). Case counts below five are presented as `<5'.
Follow-­up for vital status was conducted by the Estonian Cancer Registry at the Estonian Population Registry using unique personal identification numbers. In case of

death or emigration, the respective dates were obtained. Survival time was accumulated from the date of diagnosis until the date of death; for patients who remained alive, survival time was censored at the time of emigration or at the end of follow-u­ p, 31 December 2016.
Relative survival, which captures both direct and indirect mortality due to cancer, was used for survival analysis.9 Relative survival ratio (RSR) was calculated as the ratio of observed survival and expected survival of the underlying general population. The latter was calculated according to Ederer II method,10 based on national life tables of general-p­ opulation survival probabilities, stratified by age (in 1-y­ear increments from 0 to 99), sex and calendar year (in 1-­year intervals). Patients who were diagnosed and died on the same day were included with 1day of survival time. RSRs were calculated using the strs command in STATA V.14 (StataCorp)11 using actuarial methods and are presented with 95% CI. Relative survival estimates were age standardised using direct standardisation with International Cancer Survival Standards.12
The study protocol was approved by Tallinn Medical Research Ethics Committee (Decision No. 556, 13 February 2014).
We used the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology cohort checklist when writing our report.13
RESULTS The number of newly diagnosed CRC cases in Estonia was 546 in 1997 and 847 in 2011 (table 1). Age distribution shifted towards the elderly as the proportion of patients diagnosed at age 75 increased for both colon and rectal cancer. In colon cancer, there was a shift towards right-­ sided colon cancers. The proportion of stage III disease increased the most among colon and rectal cancer patients. The proportion of cases diagnosed at stage IV did not change.
From 1997 to 2011, the use of colonoscopy increased and the use of double contrast barium enema (DCBE) decreased in colon cancer patients (table 2). Among elective colon cancer patients, the use of colonoscopy was 82% in 1997 and 91% in 2011 (p=0.0046). Pulmonary and liver imaging for detecting distant metastases was more frequently used in 2011 both in colon and rectal cancer patients. Multidisciplinary team meetings (MDTM) were not practiced routinely in 1997 in Estonia. In 2011, treatment plan was determined in MDTM for the majority of CRC patients. Among patients who underwent elective surgery, the proportion of patients discussed in MDTM was 65% for colon and 86% for rectal cancer. The proportion of patients who had 12 lymph nodes examined pathologically increased from 2% to 58% in colon and from 2% to 50% in patients with rectal cancer.
The proportion of patients receiving radical surgery increased both in colon and rectal cancer patients (table 3). At the same time, there was an increase in the proportion of emergency surgery among surgically

treated patients. In 2011, more temporary colostomies/ ileostomies were used and less permanent colostomies were done in rectal cancer. Postoperative 30-d­ ay mortality rate decreased among patients with colon cancer.
In 1997, all colorectal resections were done by laparotomy, whereas in 2011, the proportion of laparoscopic surgery among elective procedures was 12% in colon and 8% in rectal cancer. In 2011, 5% of rectal cancer patients had their tumour removed by local excision. Radical surgery with the removal of all metastases was performed in 14% (23/167) of patients with stage IV colon and 13% (11/85) of stage IV rectal cancer in 2011.
The use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy increased among patients with stage II-IV rectal cancer (table 4). The use of adjuvant chemotherapy increased among patients with stage II-III colon cancer and patients with stage III rectal cancer.
From 1997 to 2011, the 5-y­ear age-s­tandardised RSR increased from 50% (95% CI 43% to 57%) to 58% (95% CI 52% to 63%) in colon cancer and from 37% (95% CI 29% to 45%) to 64% (95% CI 57% to 69%) in patients with rectal cancers (figure 1). Among all radically operated patients in 2011, the 5-y­ear RSR was 81% (95% CI

74% to 87%) for colon and 88% (79% to 95%) for rectal cancer; the respective RSRs in stage I-III radically operated patients were 84% (95% CI 74% to 91%) and 91% (95% CI 82% to 98%).
DISCUSSION The number of CRC cases diagnosed annually has markedly increased in Estonia over 14 years (in comparison of 1997 and 2011). Major improvements were seen in diagnostic, staging and treatment process, which have likely contributed to the significantly improved survival outcomes observed in Estonia.3
The main strength of the study was the population-­ based sample drawn from the nationwide cancer registry. Reporting to the registry in Estonia is mandatory by law. Another strength was uniform data gathering from patient records by specialised doctors according to EUROCARE High-­Resolution study protocols and ability to directly compare two incidence years. The weakness of the study was the retrospective nature of data collection. Inaccurate or missing data in medical records could have led to some bias. Owing to some differences between 1997 and

2011 study protocols, we were not able to compare all the parameters directly. According to the 1997 study protocol, data on clinical T and N status were not collected. Thus, the proportion of unknown stage was considerably higher for the 1997 cohort. Small sample size did not allow us to obtain reliable results for stage-­specific survival.
Estonian population is 1.3million. The majority of patients with CRC are treated in two cancer centres offering full range of cancer treatment modalities. Cancer care in Estonia is fully covered by public insurance. CRC population-b­ased screening programme in Estonia was initiated in 2016 and did not affect our findings. Faecal occult blood test is carried out at age 60 and repeated every 2years, the process is coordinated by family physicians. This is followed by colonoscopy in case of a positive test.
As shown previously, CRC incidence has increased significantly in Estonia.3 There was a shift in the age distribution towards older age groups, as the proportion of patients diagnosed at the age of 75 years increased significantly, probably associated with population ageing. There was also an increase in right-­sided colon cancer incidence and decrease in left-­sided colon cancer incidence. This phenomenon has been described elsewhere.14 15 The reasons for the increase in right-­sided colon cancer are not clear, but CRC subsites may have different aetiology in terms of inherited and environmental factors.16 We also found a shift in the stage distribution as the proportion of stage III patients increased both in colon and rectal cancer cohorts. This can be explained by significantly better lymph node examination and more accurate

clinical staging with the use of MRI for patients with rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant therapy.
Colonoscopy with biopsy is the main procedure for CRC diagnosis according to European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) clinical practice guidelines.17 18 The lower rate of colonoscopy and frequent use of DCBE in 1997 could probably be explained by lower availability of endoscopy and DCBE being an accessible alternative. The availability of endoscopy has improved in Estonia and there are virtually no indications left for DCBE. In emergency cases with bowel obstruction, diagnosis is usually based on emergency department CT findings and these patients receive surgery without prior endoscopy. In our data, around 20% of surgically treated patients were operated in emergency situation, this group includes mostly the patients whose diagnosis was not based on colonoscopy. Among patients who underwent elective colon cancer surgery, colonoscopy use exceeded 90% in 2011. This result is similar to that shown for Switzerland.19
Pelvic MRI is the most accurate modality for rectal cancer locoregional clinical staging.18 Another locoregional staging tool alternative to MRI is transrectal endosonography, but this was not routinely used in Estonia in 2011. In 1997, MRI was not available in Estonia. In 2011, only 36% of rectal cancer patients underwent MRI, which was probably a consequence of still low availability. Accessibility of MRI has improved lately in Estonia and currently, the majority of rectal cancer MDTM discussions are based on MRI imaging.

Thoracic and abdominal imaging are important for detecting distant metastases of CRC, which are mostly located in the liver, lungs and peritoneum. In our findings, the use of thoracic and liver imaging improved significantly. Contrast-e­nhanced CT is the preferred imaging modality. Alternatively, thoracic X-­ray and abdominal ultrasound can be used, but they have lower sensitivity and specificity.20 The 1997 study protocol did not differentiate between imaging modalities. In 2011, the majority of cases with imaging information available underwent thoracic and abdominal CT.
According to ESMO clinical practice guidelines, rectal cancer treatment plan should be established during MDTM.18 This was not the routine practice in Estonia in 1997, but in 2011, 86% of elective patients with rectal cancer were discussed at MDTM. This indicator is comparable with data shown for Sweden in the same year (around 90%).21 MDTM had limited impact on patient survival, but patients discussed were more likely to receive complete preoperative staging and neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment.22 There are centres discussing all incident CRC cases. On the other hand, there are authors who suggest that discussing routine cases would

not change the treatment plan and could be a waste of time and money. They advocate discussing only complex cases.23 24 Emergency patients are operated without MDTM decision. MDTM is especially important in rectal cancer and oligometastatic CRC, where decision making is more complex. In Sweden, around 60% of patients with colon cancer receiving elective surgery were discussed in a preoperative MDTM in 2011, but the indicator has reached 93% by 2017.25
Surgical resection is a crucial part of curative treatment for CRC. In 2011, a significantly higher proportion of patients were operated radically than in 1997. The largest increase in the proportion of radically operated patients was seen in age group 75 years (from 30% to 53%, p<0.001; data not shown). Thirty-­day postoperative mortality among radically operated patients with colon cancer decreased despite that there were significantly more elderly (75) patients in the latter period. As expected, 30-d­ ay postoperative mortality was much higher after emergency surgery compared with elective surgery (10% vs 2%, data not shown), which is consistent with previous reports.19 The reduction of postoperative CRC mortality has been described elsewhere.26 The reasons behind the decrease in surgery-r­elated mortality can be associated with better perioperative patient management: patient optimisation, application of enhanced recovery protocol, using minimally invasive surgery, advances in complication prevention and management; as well as with advances in intensive care.
Rectal cancer surgery has also evolved towards function-­sparing procedures. In our study, significantly more sphincter-­preserving operations were done in rectal cancer patients in 2011 as the proportion of permanent colostomies decreased and the use of temporary ileostomy (which are mostly closed 2months after index operation) increased. In a British analysis, abdominoperineal excision rate decreased from 29% to 21% between 1996

and 2004.27 This was explained by clearer definition of the safe distal resection margin, evolution of surgical techniques (total mesorectal excision (TME) principles, application of stapling devices in low rectal anastomosis) and use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy.27 We found that in 5% of the rectal cancer cases, the tumour was removed by local excision in 2011. This less invasive approach is indicated in selected patients with T1 cancer.28 With gradual expansion of CRC screening programme in Estonia, we expect to diagnose more T1 cancers who are suitable for local excision procedure.
In 1997, all CRC resections were done by open surgery. In 2011, the proportion of laparoscopic procedures was 12% in colon and 8% in patients with rectal cancer among elective surgeries, this is comparable to Swedish data at that time.21 25 However, the use of laparoscopic surgery in CRC has further increased in Estonia as well as in Europe.25 An analysis of 2017 data showed that at Tartu University Hospital (the second-l­argest cancer centre in Estonia), 45% of CRC resections were done laparoscopically (data not published).
The 1997 study protocol did not include data collection on the resection of metastases in stage IV CRC. In 2011, our complete resection rate for metastatic disease was 14% in colon and 13% in rectal cancer. Complete (R0) removal of metastases offers the only chance of cure for patients with advanced CRC. In a systematic review, the median of 5-­year survival estimates among patients who received complete metastasectomy was 38%.29 Liver resection rates ranging from 10% to 30% were reported. The rate of curative surgery for metastatic CRC has improved with perioperative use of combination therapy regimens including biological therapy.30 A recent analysis showed that the 5-­year RSR for stage IV CRC in Estonia was 13%.3 This is comparable with respective estimate from Sweden (15%).31
We observed an unexpected unfavourable trend as the proportion of emergency surgeries increased significantly. In 2011, every fourth colon cancer surgery was performed after emergency admission, a similar estimate was reported for Sweden.25 The main reason for both the persistently high proportion of stage IV patients and the observed increase in emergency surgery patients (most of them with bowel obstruction) is probably delay in diagnosis. This could be caused by lack of screening (population-­based CRC screening was initiated in Estonia in 2016) and low awareness about CRC symptoms among general public as well as primary care doctors resulting in delayed presentation and referral. Another problem could be the delay of treatment due to long waiting period for the staging procedures and treatment.32 33
In locoregionally advanced rectal cancer, preoperative radiotherapy is associated with lower risk of local recurrence and better outcomes.34 In 1997, neoadjuvant radiotherapy was not in routine clinical practice in Estonia and only 6% of stage II and 20% of stage III patients with rectal cancer received this treatment. The receipt of radiotherapy has been affected by limited availability

as the relative number of linear accelerators in Estonia has been one of the lowest in Europe according to the ESTRO-­HERO survey.35 This situation had improved by 2011 when 39% of stage II and 50% of stage III patients with rectal cancer received neoadjuvant radiotherapy, that accounts for half of all radically operated patients. In a recent Danish CRC registry study, the use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy was 29% among radically operated patients with rectal cancer.36 In Norway, the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was 39% among stage I-III radically operated patients with rectal cancer.37
Pathological examination of regional lymph nodes is crucial for accurate staging. International consensus standard suggests examination of at least 12 lymph nodes from a resected CRC specimen.38 In 1997, this standard was not adopted in Estonia and only 2% of radically operated patients had 12 lymph nodes examined. Therefore, a significant proportion of patients were probably understaged. By 2011, the quality of pathology had significantly improved as 58% patients with colon cancer and 50% patients with rectal cancer had 12 lymph nodes examined. Nevertheless, these results remain considerably worse than those shown for Norway39or Switzerland19 for the same period. However, according to a trial including 266 patients conducted recently at Tartu University Hospital, 12 lymph nodes were examined in 69% of conventionally investigated CRC specimens and 86% of methylene blue stained specimens, suggesting that the routine practice has further improved in Estonia.40
Colon cancer prognosis can be significantly improved by postoperative chemotherapy in stage III patients.41 In our study, only 42% of patients with stage III colon cancer received adjuvant chemotherapy in 1997; in 2011, the respective percentage was 63%. Among radically resected stage III patients, this proportion was 69% (data not shown), while it was 59% in Swsitzerland in 2011-20119. In comparison of 6 European countries, the proportion of resected stage III colon cancer receiving chemotherapy in Estonia was not inferior to Western European countries in 2011.42 The use of chemotherapy also increased in neoadjuvant and palliative settings.
Aforementioned advances in diagnostics, staging, multidisciplinary management and better surgical care are the most likely explanation for better long-­term results as the 5-­year RSR increased from 50% to 58% in colon cancer and from 37% to 64% in rectal cancer. These survival increases are in line with previously reported estimates.3 There was no definitive change towards earlier diagnosis. Due to small sample size in 1-­year cohorts, we were not able to obtain reliable survival estimates by stage. However, a previous publication reported a large increase in stage-­specific survival in Estonia: comparing two periods (1995-1999 and 2010-2014), a significant survival gain was seen for rectal cancer in stage II (from 58% to 75%), stage III (from 34% to 70%) and stage IV (from 1% to 12%). For colon cancer, the largest survival gain was seen in stage IV (from 6% to 15%).3 These increases in survival are consistent with the improvements

in staging and treatment patterns demonstrated in our study.
CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study demonstrate the benefit of participating in EUROCARE studies that have revealed shortcomings in the quality of care in Estonia compared with most Northern and Western European countries and strengthened the motivation to take steps towards improvement. Major advances from 1997 to 2011 were seen in the diagnostic, staging and treatment patterns of CRC in Estonia: increase in the use of colonoscopy and imaging for distant metastases, introduction of MRI imaging for rectal cancer, higher rate of radical surgery with lower procedure-r­elated mortality, substantial improvement in the quality of pathological examination and the adoption of multimodality treatment approach. These advances are likely to have contributed to improved survival shown for Estonia. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement in all abovementioned areas. High proportion of patients diagnosed at a late stage and increasing rate of emergency surgeries remain an obstacle for achieving even better outcomes. These findings suggest the need to raise awareness about CRC symptoms among general public as well as among primary care doctors and to expand the quality-a­ ssured screening programme in Estonia. Continuous monitoring of performance and outcomes is necessary and further studies are warranted to examine diagnostic and treatment delays and centralisation of surgical treatment as possible areas of improvement.

ABSTRACT Objectives To identify mental health prospective trajectories before and after a second lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic and their associations with somatic symptoms. Design Prospective Study. Setting Population-b­ ased study drawn from a probability-­ based internet panel of over 100 000 Israelis. Participants Adults aged 18 years or more, representative of the adult Israeli population. The participants were measured at two time points (time 1 (T1) pre-­second lockdown N=1029; response rate=76.17%; time 2 (T2) post-­second lockdown N=764; response rate=74.24%). Main outcome measures Trajectories of anxiety and adjustment disorder based on clinical cut-­off score for probable diagnoses across T1-­T2, somatic symptoms at T2. The four trajectories: stable-­low, (no probable diagnosis), stable-­high (stable probable diagnosis), exacerbation (no probable diagnosis at T1, probable diagnosis at T2), recovery (probable diagnosis at T1, no probable diagnosis at T2). Results Three anxiety trajectories predicted probable somatic symptoms (stable-­high OR=6.451; exacerbation OR=5.379; recovery OR=2.025) compared with the stable-­ low trajectory. The three adjustment disorder trajectories also predicted somatic symptoms (stable-­high OR=4.726; exacerbation OR=6.419; recovery OR=4.666) compared with the stable-l­ow trajectory. Conclusions Our data show elevated somatic symptoms among those whose mental health trajectories were poor, exacerbated and those who recovered following the second lockdown. The presentation of somatic symptoms may mask psychological vulnerabilities, even among those who appear to have recovered from the stressor. This indicates that lockdown may be a double-­edged sword and should be carefully administered given these populations vulnerabilities.
INTRODUCTION From a mental health perspective, the COVID-19 pandemic can be viewed as a highly stressful event likely to lead to anxiety and stress-­related disorders.1 Particularly interesting, are the specific stressors associated

Strengths and limitations of this study
 To our knowledge, this is the first study to address the association between mental health trajectories and somatic symptoms before and after a second lockdown.
 The survey used a robust quota sampling method representative of the Israeli adult population based on age and sex.
 Findings are based on a large longitudinal national sample enabling identification of mental health trajectories.
 The use of unrelated robust and validated measures of adjustment disorder, anxiety and somatisation allows us to report those trajectories of adjustment disorder and anxiety at higher risk of increased somatic symptoms.
 The main weaknesses of this study are potential selection bias and the lack of measurement of somatic symptoms and mental health indices before the COVID-19 pandemic.
with a lockdown, given that such restrictions play such an important role in preventing COVID-19 outbreaks.2 Several studies have pointed to an association between a single lockdown and poorer mental health.3 4 However, in some countries, there was more than one lockdown. Israel was one of the first countries to apply a second lockdown, as a result of a rapid infection increase (18 September to 8 November 2020). The current study explored trajectories of mental health,5 and the associations between these trajectories and somatic symptoms over time.
Despite the plethora of studies examining mental health during COVID-19, few studies have addressed adjustment disorder.6 7 Furthermore, studies regarding the association between mental health and somatic symptoms are scarce among the general population,8 9 although these are commonly reported by patients in both

general population and clinical settings.8 Somatic symptom burden has been related to higher age, lower education, social and economic status, and unemployment.10-12 Huang et al9 in China reported a prevalence of 7.59% somatic symptoms in the general population following the COVID-19 outbreak. A high somatic symptom burden has also been associated with reduced subjective health and quality of life, increased psychological distress and use of healthcare services.12 Only a few studies have assessed the prevalence of adjustment disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic.6 7 However, no study thus far has examined a lockdown-r­elated adjustment disorder trajectory and its relation to somatic symptoms. Distinguishing this specific disorder is crucial in understanding the relative importance of such a stressor compared with general anxiety during the pandemic. Moreover, to date, no study has examined mental health symptoms before and after lockdowns and tested their accumulated burden. As a result, the aforementioned studies lack the prospective perspective of any change and fluctuations that might follow lockdowns.
Empirical research on how mental health and health-­ related behaviours have changed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic remains limited and is largely based on cross-s­ectional data or very narrow prospective data collected before and during the pandemic. Increasing attention has been made to different groupings of responses to this global crisis. A trajectories approach used in longitudinal studies of mental health following potential stressors has identified four main outcome patterns or trajectories over time, namely chronic, recovered, delayed onset and resilient.13 14 Cross-s­ectional diagnostic classification can easily overlook these trajectories. For example, recovery may be conflated with resilience or chronic stress depending on when it is assessed. To understand the peri-­ implication and postimplication of the COVID-19 crisis, and lockdowns in particular, prospective studies which comprise large national samples are required. Based on the trajectories approach, the current study suggests four trajectories: a `stable-l­ow trajectory' which included participants who did not reach the clinical cut-o­ff of anxiety and adjustment disorder at either time 1 (T1) or time 2 (T2), a `recovery trajectory' which included participants that reached full criteria of probable anxiety/probable adjustment disorder at T1, but recovered at T2 and did not reach the clinical cut-o­ ffs of anxiety/adjustment disorder; a `stable-­high trajectory' which included participants that reached full criteria of probable anxiety/ probable adjustment disorder at both T1 and T2, and an `exacerbation trajectory', which includes participants that did not reach criteria of probable anxiety/adjustment disorder at T1 but reached full criteria of probable anxiety/probable adjustment disorder at T2. To date, we know of no prospective studies that examined the impact of trajectories of mental health on somatic symptoms before and after a second lockdown.
This study has several novel characteristics. First, it is the first study to assess mental health before and after a

second lockdown. Second, this is one of the first studies to measure trajectories of adjustment disorder based on the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11). Third, this is one of the first studies to measure the association between trajectories of mental health and somatic symptoms.
The present study aims to: (1) identify prospective trajectories of anxiety and adjustment disorder before and after the second lockdown; (2) examine the associations of anxiety and adjustment disorder during the COVID-19 crisis with somatic symptoms and probable somatic symptoms after the second lockdown.
We hypothesised that lockdown-r­elated stable-­high and exacerbation trajectories will be associated with greater somatic symptoms, compared with `recovery' and `stable-­low' trajectories.
METHODS Recruitment and eligibility Data were collected from 3 August to 30 August 2020 for T1 and 15 November to 3 December for T2. Eligibility criteria specified that participants should be: aged 18 or over; Israeli residents at the time the survey was conducted; able to give informed consent; fluent in their native language.
Sample size As a minimum, we estimated that 610 participants would be required to detect low-­medium effect sizes of 0.20, with 90% power and a 5% significance level based on inclusion of 12 explanatory variables (6 background variables and 6 trajectories that were compared with the reference group), in a logistic regression model. For the two-­way analysis of variance (ANOVA) we detected a need for a 523 minimum sample size, on the basis of 16 groups (4 adjustment disorder trajectories×4 anxiety trajectories), low-­medium effect sizes of 0.20, with 90% power and a 5% significance level. Overall, for logistic regression, a simulation study recommended a minimum sample size of 500 to derive statistics that can represent the parameters in the targeted population.15
Sampling and procedures The study was conducted according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines for observational studies.
We used Israel's iPanel company to deploy the COVID-19 Mental Health Survey. This panel is a probability-­based panel with over 100 000 members.16 The panels consist of adults aged 18-85 who have given their consent to be contacted about surveys. Panel recruitment is dynamic and constant using a range of online methods.
iPanel adheres to the stringent standards of the world association for market, social and opinion researchers (ESOMAR). From this panel, we recruited participants aged 18-71.

A quota sampling approach was used with quotas meeting the Israeli national census data on age and sex, as specified by the Israeli Bureau of Statistics census data. The use of this approach ensured that a good representation of the adult population in Israel. After the quotas and required sample size were reached, the survey was closed.
The final data set was weighted according to these factors (age and sex) to enable the study to be considered representative of the internet-u­ sing participants of 18-71 years living in Israel.
At T1, out of 1351 invitations sent, 1029 responded (response rate=76.17%); at T2, out of 1029 participants in T1 (baseline), 764 responded (response rate=74.24%). We conducted a set of sensitivity analyses at T1 comparing those who did answer the survey to those who did not (n=322) on the following key demographic factors age (t(1049)=1.10; p=0.271), sex (²(1)=2.65; p=0.104), marital status (²(4)=1.33; p=0.856), income (²(4)=2.77; p=0.594) and education (²(5)=6.84; p=0.145). No differences were found between the groups.
Measurements Demographic variables were age (mean=40.75; SD=14.75; range 18-71), sex coded men as `1' women as `2' (50.5% of the sample, n=520). Most of the participants were in a committed relationship (58.3% of the sample, n=600) coded as `1' for single, `2' for committed relationship, `3' for divorced, `4' for separated and `5' for widowed. Education was coded as `1' for elementary school, `2' for high school without diploma, `3' for high school graduate with diploma, `4' for higher education with no diploma, `5' for undergraduate diploma and `6' for postgraduate diploma. Income was measured by the following question: `the average monthly income in Israel in August 2020 was 13 558 NIS (2570 GBP). Please rate your income in comparison'. The rating was done on a 5-p­ oint Likert scale coded as `1' much below average, `2' a little below average, `3' about the average, `4' a little above the average and `5' much above average.
Risk group for COVID-19 was measured by the following question: `do you suffer from one of the following medical conditions: (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer)'. The list was composed according to the WHO and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Being in a risk group for COVID-19 was coded as `1' for being in risk group for COVID-19 and `2' for being in non-­risk group for COVID19. For elaborated demographics, see table 1.
Anxiety was measured using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-i­tem Scale (GAD-7).17 Participants indicated how often they had been bothered by each symptom over the last 2 weeks on a 4-p­ oint Likert scale (0=not at all, to 3=nearly every day). The reliability as measured by Cronbach's alpha was high for both times: T1 (=0.92) and T2 (=0.91). Higher scores indicated higher level of anxiety (ranged score 0-21) and were divided into two categories

of anxiety severity (0-9 no probable anxiety; 10-21 probable anxiety).
Adjustment disorder in the form of ICD-11 probable adjustment disorder was measured using the International Adjustment Disorder Questionnaire 19-i­tem (IADQ).18 The IADQ comprises two parts. First is a checklist of a

stressors list covering different aspects of life. The second IADQ component assesses adjustment disorder core symptoms (six-­items) tapping into two symptoms clusters (`preoccupation' and `failure to adapt'), functional impairment (three-­items) rated on 5-p­ oint Likert scale (0=not at all, to 4=extremely). The 10th question assesses when the symtpoms has begun (coded as 0 for no (not within the first month of the stressful event) and 1 for yes (within the first month of the stressful event)). The algorithm for a probable diagnosis of ICD-11 adjustment disorder requires the presence of a psychosocial stressor (score 1 on the IADQ stressor list), at least one preoccupation symptom rated 2, at least one failure-­to-­adapt symptom rated 2, and evidence of functional impairment rated 2. The reliability as measured by Cronbach's alpha in T1 (=0.93) and T2 (=0.94) were excellent.
Somatic symptoms severity was measured using the Somatic Severity Scale 8-i­tem Scale (SSS-8).19 Respondents rated how much they were bothered by common somatic symptoms within the last seven days on a 5-p­ oint Likert scale (0=not at all to 4=very much). Higher scores indicated higher level of somatic symptoms (ranged score 0-32) and were divided into five categories of somatic severity (0-3 none-m­ inimal; 4-7 low; 8-11 medium; 12-15 high; 16-32 very high). For the purpose of this study, we used the cut-­off score of 12 and above for indicating high somatic symptoms severity. The reliability as measured by Cronbach's alpha in T2 (=0.83) was good.
Statistical methods The analytic plan included a descriptive epidemiological approach to depict mental health trajectories across the two assessments, before and after the second lockdown. We used the GAD-7 and IADQ cut-o­ ffs in order to determine the trajectories in the current study. Four trajectory groups were generated: (1) participants with no probable anxiety/adjustment disorder at both T1-T­ 2 (`stable-­low trajectory'); (2) participants with probable anxiety/ adjustment disorder at both T1-­T2 (`stable-­high trajectory'); (3) participants with no probable anxiety/adjustment disorder at T1 and probable anxiety/adjustment disorder at T2 (`exacerbation trajectory'); (4) participants with probable anxiety/adjustment disorder at T1 and no probable anxiety/adjustment disorder at T2 (`recovery trajectory'). The rates of each trajectory were identified for both anxiety and adjustment disorder. In order to show the differences between the trajectories which relied on cut-o­ ffs (dichotomous scores), we present the descriptive information in figures--means of the anxiety and adjustment disorder in the continuous scores of the scales used. Then, we tested the rates of probable somatic symptoms in the different mental health trajectories. In order to characterise the trajectories with respect to demographic data, a multinomial regression on anxiety and adjustment disorder trajectories by background variables was performed.
Second, we addressed the differences between the trajectory groups for both adjustment disorder and

anxiety, as well as the combination between them along with their impact on the severity of somatic symptoms in T2. A two-w­ ay ANOVA was conducted. The main effects as well as the interaction effect were calculated.
Third, a logistic regression model examined the outcome variable of probable dichotomous somatic symptoms severity (T2). In the first step, age, sex, relationship status, income and education were included in the model. Risk group membership for COVID-19 was also added to the model. In the second step, we added the trajectories T1-­T2 of anxiety severity categories and ICD-11 probable adjustment disorder. We tested whether the trajectories would significantly contribute to somatic symptoms severity, compared with the stable-l­ow trajectory (reference group).

RESULTS Cohort characteristics Table 1 summarises the main characteristics of the participants, alongside comparative data on Israeli population where available.
Descriptive information Prevalence of high somatic severity symptoms was 18.8% (n=144). Four different trajectories were identified on the basis of cut-o­ ff scores for probable anxiety and probable adjustment disorder. The `stable-l­ow trajectory' included the majority of the sample in both anxiety (78.1%) and adjustment disorder (71.3%). A second trajectory had the `recovery' course (9.0% and 8.9%, respectively). Of the entire sample, 5.4% and 11.8% belonged to the `stable-­ high' trajectory of anxiety and adjustment disorder. A fourth trajectory--the `exacerbation' trajectory-- included 7.5% and 8.0% in the anxiety and adjustment disorder, respectively. The trajectories of anxiety and adjustment disorder are presented in figures 1 and 2.
The prevalence rates of the probable somatic severity symptoms in the anxiety trajectories were 11.1%, 61.0%, 49.1% and 36.2% among the `stable-­low', `stable high', `exacerbation' and `recovery' trajectories, respectively. The prevalence rates of the probable somatic severity symptoms in the adjustment disorder trajectories were 8.8%, 48.9%, 44.3% and 36.8% among the `stable-l­ow', `stable high', `exacerbation' and `recovery' trajectories, respectively.
Predicting trajectories by background variables A multinomial regression on anxiety trajectories by background variables showed trajectories to be predicted

Younger age was significantly associated with the exacerbation group (b=-0.032, SE=0.014, Wald=5.571, p=0.018, OR 0.969, 95% CI 0.943 to 0.995) and stable-­high group (b=-0.040, SE=0.015, Wald=6.705, p=0.010, OR 0.961 95% CI 0.932 to 0.990) compared with the stable-­low group.

Differences between the trajectories and severity of somatic symptoms A two-w­ ay ANOVA showed significant main effects and non-­significant interaction effects. A main effect for the anxiety trajectories demonstrated significant differences between the anxiety trajectories in the severity of somatic symptoms F(3, 748)=16.723, p<0.001, ²=0.04. The stable-­low trajectory (M=8.19, SD=0.34) reported significantly lower severity of somatic symptoms compared with the stable-­high (M=13.38, SD=0.93), exacerbation (M=12.34, SD=0.69) and recovery (M=10.02, SD=0.60) trajectories. The differences between the stable-l­ow and both the stable-­high (mean difference=-5.19, p<0.001) and exacerbation trajectories (mean difference=-4.15, p<0.001) were greater than the difference between the stable-­low and the recovery trajectory (mean difference=-1.89, p=0.050).
An ANOVA for the adjustment disorder trajectories showed significant differences between the trajectories in the severity of somatic symptoms F(3, 760)=17.623, p<0.001, ²=0.05. The stable-­low trajectory (M=8.04, SD=0.47) reported significantly lower severity of somatic

symptoms compared with the stable-h­igh (M=12.99, SD=0.53), exacerbation (M=12.07, SD=0.82) and recovery (M=10.83, SD=0.80) trajectories. The differences between the stable-­low and both the stable-­high (mean difference=-4.96, p<0.001) and exacerbation trajectories (mean difference=-4.03, p<0.001) were greater than the difference between the stable-l­ow and the recovery trajectory (mean difference=-2.79, p=0.016).
The interaction between the trajectories of adjustment disorder and the trajectories of anxiety was not significant F(9, 748)=1.467, p=0.156, ²=0.01.
Role of mental health trajectories in predicting risk for probable somatic symptoms A logistic regression found that trajectories of both the anxiety and adjustment disorder were associated with somatic symptoms at T2 (see table 2). Participants with a stable high trajectory, exacerbation trajectory or recovery trajectory had substantially higher odds of having somatic symptoms at T2, compared with participants with a low-­ stable trajectory.
The OR shows that participants with an exacerbation trajectory in adjustment disorder had the highest odds (OR 6.419) of experiencing somatic symptoms at T2, compared with the other trajectories (high stable OR 4.726 and recovery OR 4.666), all as compared with the

stable-­low trajectory. The statistical difference between the strength of the coefficients of the trajectories was not significant (p value ranged from 0.490 to 0.690).
As for the anxiety trajectories, the stable-h­ igh trajectory (OR 6.451) and the exacerbation trajectory (OR 5.379) had the highest OR for experiencing somatic symptoms at T2, compared with the recovery trajectory that showed lower odds ratio (OR 2.025), all compared with the group-s­table-­low trajectory. This was reflected further in the statistical difference between the stable-­high and the recovery trajectory t(1508)=2.27, p=0.02 and between the exacerbation and the recovery trajectories t(1508)=2.09, p=0.036.
DISCUSSION Several studies have suggested that mental health has deteriorated over time in many countries during the pandemic.20-22 We explored trajectories of anxiety and adjustment disorder before and after the second lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. In line with the existing literature on responses to mass trauma, four types of mental health trajectories were identified: stable-­low, stable-­high, exacerbation and recovery groups. These trajectories, with similarities in distribution, have been reported for other disorders namely Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),23 depression and anxiety,24 25 in different populations.5
To date, we know of one, UK-­based study that has examined trajectories of anxiety and depression over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.26 However, this UK study focused on the first lockdown measuring changes in anxiety and depression. Our analysis of multiple events underscored the complex and non-h­ omogenous reactions to lockdowns. Several demographic variables predicted trajectories of response. Being female was a risk factor for more psychopathological trajectories of anxiety and adjustment disorder symptoms for the stable-h­ igh trajectory of adjustment disorder and the recovery trajectory of anxiety and adjustment disorder. Older age was associated with lower odds of belonging to the stable-­high or exacerbation trajectories compared with the stable-­low trajectory. Risk group membership was associated with higher odds of belonging to the stable-h­ igh group of anxiety and adjustment disorder and to the exacerbation group of adjustment disorder.
The current study showed the association between poor mental health (anxiety and adjustment disorder trajectories) and elevated risk of somatic symptoms. For both anxiety and adjustment disorder, affiliation to the stable-­high, exacerbation and the recovery T1-T­ 2 trajectories were significantly associated with higher risk for somatic symptoms at T2, compared with the stable-l­ow trajectory. It is important to note that for adjustment disorder the three trajectories were associated with somatic symptoms at T2 in a similar magnitude. However, for anxiety, the association between the recovery trajectory and somatic symptoms at T2 was significantly lower

than the associations between stable-h­igh and exacerbation trajectories and somatic symtpoms. Adjustment disorder refers to a specific stressor of the lockdown and was reflected in all the three trajectories which differed from the stable-­low trajectory. However, trajectories of anxiety suggested a more general anxiety construct that is global and not stressor specific. Thus, the findings show that adjustment disorder manages to capture the consequences of lockdowns more than anxiety.
In line with our hypotheses, the groups with stable-­ high and exacerbation trajectories (before and after a second lockdown) of anxiety were associated with higher somatic symptoms at T2, compared to the stable-l­ow group. Huang and his colleagues9 found that during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, anxious people were more likely to have somatic symptoms than people without anxiety symptoms. This was also observed through somatic symptoms burden among those with higher vulnerability to anxiety.26 Thus, stress can be expressed over time through emotional and somatic roots, implying that researchers and clinicians should remain open minded regarding the course of symptoms of anxiety and screen for both anxiety and somatisation. High stable anxiety and elevated levels of arousal which accompany such stress conditions may change bodily sensations and produce physiological changes that may have manifestations in various conditions and diseases.27 Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic seemed to trigger specific somatic schemata and thoughts of health/illness in particular among high anxious people with a more vulnerable anxiety trajectory.27 Finally, among highly anxious individuals with a chronic and exacerbated course, worries may switch between the fear of COVID-19 and the fear of other diseases (somatisation).
A similar finding emerged with regard to trajectories of adjustment disorder; as expected, groups with stable-­high and exacerbation trajectories (before and after a second lockdown) of adjustment disorder reported higher levels of somatic symptoms in T2 compared to the stable-l­ow group. One possible explanation may be related to multifaceted changes people experienced during cumulative lockdown periods. Adaptability to such rapid and profound change has been undoubtedly a challenging process, suggesting increase in stress levels of many individuals that are associated with somatic symptoms. In line with this notion, it was found that cumulative psychosocial stressors predict greater somatic symptoms. Despite the high correlation between somatic symptoms with depression and anxiety, stressors predicted somatic symptoms even when controlling the above variables.28 In the current study, items for each of the variables namely adjustment disorder, anxiety and somatic symptoms were distinct, with no overlap between them.
Surprisingly, the recovery group-p­ articipants with probable mental health problems (anxiety or adjustment disorder at T1 and no probable anxiety or adustment disorder at T2), was associated with elevated risk for a somatic symptoms, compared to the resilient/stable-l­ow

trajectory. One possible explanation may be related to the difference between recovery and resilient/stable-l­ow trajectories.13 While recovery implies a healthy pattern, it suggests a less adaptive coping as compared to the resilient/stable-­low trajectory. The recovery trajectory was found to be a vulnerability pattern that is stress-­related and associated with somatic symptoms. In line with this notion, it might be that the recovery trajectory group was able to cope better in comparison to the exacerbation and stable-­high groups following the second lockdown.
Overall, the findings of the study show the association between anxiety and adjustment disorder trajectories with somatic symtpoms following a second lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. The global crisis of COVID-19 pandemic challenges countries with potential lockdowns. The healthcare system that administered the lockdown, politicians and public health officials who mandated it should carefully consider the need for such action given the costs to vulnerable parts of the population. Our data emphasise the importance of supporting individuals during lockdowns in order to reduce psychological distress, and the different types of trajectories evident in response to this continuous stressor. Moreover, the present findings may point to the importance of identifying and targeting somatic symptoms as indicators of mental health problems. This may be done by general practitioners who can include a brief somatic symptoms screening as part of a patient's visit, especially during a crisis period. This may facilitate the management of mental health problems during uncertain times such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and in doing so may reduce costs and burden on the healthcare system. From a clinical perspective, interventions should be specific to vulnerable populations and take into consideration the specific burden that comes with stress among specific groups during the lifespan of a continuous stressor such as the global COVID-19 pandemic.
Discussion of methodology We employed an online survey using quota sampling from a probability-­based internet panel of the Israeli population. This had several advantages
First, internet penetration in Israel as of January 2021 is 88.0% (7.68 million out of 8.72 million) and percentage of mobile connections in Israel as of January 2021 is 116.9% (10.2 million out of 8.72 million) as some people have more than one mobile phone (https://datareportal. com/reports/digital-2021-israel).
Second, online surveys have become important during the COVID-19 pandemic as traditional survey methods were less feasible.29
Third, obtaining high-q­uality behavioural data or mental health data in a longitudinal design during COVID-19 pandemic is still uncommon.29
Fourth, an online survey enabled us to collect real-­time data regarding health and mental health.29
Fifth, online surveys can be created and deployed in very short time in comparison to traditional surveys.29 This

is particularly important during an ongoing pandemic where a number of external factors (eg, infection rates and governmental response) change rapidly.
Sixth, people feel less reluctant to disclose sensitive information in an online format.30
However, all these benefits come with a price tag of selection bias. Selection bias can be reduced by using probability panels in countries with high internet penetration and high mobile connectivity. Using an online survey taken from a probability panel will have higher external validity and better generalisation of the general population in comparison to online surveys taken from non-­probabilistic panel and countries with low internet penetration and mobile connectivity.
To sum, during COVID-19 pandemic, online surveys proved their value in collecting medical and mental health data. While the problem of selection bias still exists, the benefits and potential solutions to reduce this bias are justifying the use of online surveys.
Limitations The findings of this study should be considered in the light of several limitations. The first and foremost is selection bias. However, using a probability-b­ased internet panel that is weighted and dynamically adjusted to meet the Israeli Bureau of Statistics in terms of age and sex in a country with high internet penetration and mobile connections is one way to reduce selection bias. Second, while random stratified sampling is often preferable in comparison to quota sampling, the use of robust quota sampling enables a high response rate based on probability-b­ased internet panel of the Israeli internet user population. This is highly valuable in longitudinal designs. Contrary to this, the use of random stratified sampling tends to yield lower response rates. A previous study based on the same probability-b­ ased internet panel using a random stratification sampling led to 31.00% response rate16 versus 76.17% response rate in the current study. We note that a probability sampling with low response rate suffers from the same potential bias as a non-­probability sampling and therefore enjoys no clear advantage over a quota sampling.31
Study design considerations related to probability panels and real-t­ime assessments can potentially reduce bias and increase the rigour of online surveys.
Moreover, quota sampling reflects the general population can be deployed when time constraints exist such as lockdowns during COVID-19 pandemic. Using stratified random samples before and after a second lockdown could lead to the miss of time window for sampling. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic increased the homogeneity in the population related to the shared experience of the pandemic. In such conditions wherein homogeneity increases, quota sampling has further advantages, and it was found to have similar estimates compared with probability sampling.32
However, we did not have pre-­COVID-19 assessments of mental health conditions. We did not measure somatic

symptoms before the second lockdown was applied (T1). It could be that somatic symptoms exacerbated the mental health symptoms. Earlier somatisation symptoms may serve as marker of later stress reactions. Finally, reliance on self-­ report data may be liable to recall bias when assessing the occurrence of mental health symptoms.
In conclusion, lockdowns should be viewed as multifaceted by impacting health and mental health. While lockdowns prevent the spread of an infection, this may be at the cost of health and mental health. Our study strengthens the argument that a lockdown during a pandemic is a double-­edged sword.

ABSTRACT Objective To investigate the association between troponin positivity in patients hospitalised with COVID-­19 and increased mortality in the short term. Setting Homerton University Hospital, an inner-­city district general hospital in East London. Design A single-c­ entre retrospective observational study. Participants All adults admitted with swab-­proven RT-­ PCR COVID-­19 to Homerton University Hospital from 4 February 2020 to 30 April 2020 (n=402). Outcome measures We analysed demographic and biochemical data collected from the patient record according to the primary outcome of death at 28 days during hospital admission. Methods Troponin positivity was defined above the upper limit of normal according to our local laboratory assay (>15.5 ng/L for females, >34 ng/L for males). Univariate and multivariate logistical regression analyses were performed to evaluate the link between troponin positivity and death. Results Mean age was 65.3 years for men compared with 63.8 years for women. A 2 test showed survival of patients with COVID-­19 was significantly higher in those with a negative troponin (p=3.23×10-10) compared with those with a positive troponin. In the multivariate logistical regression, lung disease, age, troponin positivity and continuous positive airway pressure were all significantly associated with death, with an area under the curve of 0.889, sensitivity of 0.886 and specificity of 0.629 for the model. Within this model, troponin positivity was independently associated with short-­term mortality (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.34 to 6.61, p=0.008). Conclusions We demonstrated an independent association between troponin positivity and increased short-t­erm mortality in COVID-­19 in a London district general hospital.
INTRODUCTION COVID-­19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-C­oV-­2 virus. The COVID-­19 pandemic has so far resulted in over 515 million recorded infections and over 6 million deaths worldwide.1 A significant proportion of patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome and require hospitalisation and

ventilatory support with subsequent morbidity and mortality. Early data from Wuhan first outlined the association of COVID-1­9 and myocardial injury exhibited by elevated cardiac biomarkers.2 3 This has subsequently been replicated in various studies and meta-­ analyses from around the world.4
The mechanisms for myocardial injury in COVID-­19 are not fully understood. A combination of systemic hypoxia, cytokine storm, renal failure, coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction appear to be implicated.5 The SARS-­CoV-­2 virus gains entry to cells through binding to the ACE2 receptor, which can be found in a variety of organs including the heart, in theory having the propensity to have a direct effect on the myocardium.6 Cardiac imaging studies of patients recovered from COVID-­19 show evidence of a range of patterns and localisation of myocardial injury, with acute and subacute myocardial inflammation suggesting distinct pathways leading to myocardial damage.7
Elevated cardiac biomarkers have been found to be associated with poorer outcomes in COVID-1­9. Studies have shown that the presence of elevated cardiac biomarkers including cardiac troponin appear to be associated with both death and increased intensive care (ICU) admissions, as well as the requirement for ventilation.8 As well as biochemical markers, multiple demographic factors have been identified as adverse

prognostic predictors in COVID-1­9 infection. These include increasing age, male sex, positive smoking status, comorbidities including diabetes and obesity, chronic major organ diseases and autoimmune diseases.9
COVID-1­9 infection will likely remain an ongoing public health issue with further surges and pandemics; continuing to characterise the clinical profile and prognostic features of patients with COVID-1­ 9 is important to identify those at higher risk of severe disease and hospitalisation. In this study, we primarily aimed to better delineate and clarify the relationship between elevated cardiac biomarkers and mortality in COVID-­19 in a population of hospitalised COVID-1­ 9 patients at an inner-­city London district general hospital during the first wave of the pandemic in early 2020. The study is evaluating the prognostic value of myocardial injury beyond the scope of type 1 myocardial infarction. We also investigated other factors that may be implicated in the prognostication of patients with COVID-1­ 9 including demographics such as age, ethnicity and smoking status, comorbidities including hypertension and diabetes mellitus and interventions such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
METHODS Data collection All adults admitted with swab-p­ roven reverse-­transcriptase polymerase chain reaction(RT-­ PCR) COVID-1­9 to Homerton University Hospital (HUH), London, from the date of the first positive swab from 2 March 2020 to 30 April 2020 were eligible for inclusion. Patients were identified using the hospital coding system applied to unselected adults admitted for acute medical care at HUH. Patients under the age of 18 years and those without a positive SARS-­CoV-2­ real-t­ime RT-­PCR were excluded.
We retrospectively analysed the patient records from the electronic patient record (EPR) with the primary outcome defined as mortality within 28 days of admission to HUH. Data including observations and laboratory tests (including serum high sensitivity troponin I (hs-­TnI)) were automatically extracted from the EPR. Serum troponin was evaluated at different time points in patients and not performed systematically in all patients. Additional data including admission ECG, presenting symptoms and outcomes were then manually collected for these patients from EPR and patient case notes where required. Manual validation of a random sample of 10% of the dataset was completed.
Patient and public involvement Patients and the public were not involved in the design or analysis of the study.
Laboratory methods Serum hs-­TnI levels were assessed by a high-­sensitivity cardiac troponin I microparticle chemiluminescent immunoassay (ARCHITECT STAT, hs-T­ NI, Abbott) on

the fully automated Abbott ARCHITECT analyser (Abbott ARCHITECT STAT high sensitive troponin-­I. Package insert. G1-­0139/R02. 2013). The upper reference limit of hs-­TNI defined as the 99th percentile of hs-T­ NI distribution in a reference population was 15.5 ng/L for females and 34 ng/L for males respectively. Limit of blank and limit of detection have been determined as 0.7-1.3 ng/L and 1.1-1.9 ng/L, respectively.
Statistical analysis Data were analysed according to the primary outcome of death during hospital admission. Patients with a type 1 myocardial infarction (MI), defined as having new ischaemic changes on ECG, a positive troponin and being started on therapeutic anticoagulation were excluded from regression analysis on the primary outcome but included in summary tables. A Mann-­Whitney U test was performed to compare troponin values against the primary outcome, and a 2 test was performed to compare troponin positivity against the primary outcome. Further 2, Fisher's exact and Mann-W­ hitney U tests were performed to compare troponin positivity to demographic, laboratory imaging and other outcomes including ICU admission, but these were not corrected for multiple testing and should be interpreted as exploratory. Confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for the above testing. A p-v­alue <0.05 was considered as significant. Univariate and multivariate logistical regression analyses were performed to evaluate the link between troponin positivity and death in addition to a Cox proportional hazards model. Numerous different demographics, clinical and biochemical variables were tested for association with short-t­erm mortality, and area under the curve (AUC) was computed for all regressions. Sensitivity and specificity were computed for the multivariate regression. A Kaplan-M­ eier survival analysis was completed. All data analysis was performed in the statistical computing software R (V.4.0.3). Statistical tests used were discussed with an independent statistician to ensure the appropriateness of the tests used.
RESULTS Population characteristics 402 adult inpatients were found to have swab-­proven RT-P­ CR COVID-­19 between 2 March 2020 and 30 April 2020. 83 patients did not have a troponin measured and were therefore excluded. The in-h­ ospital mortality of patients with (n=319) and without (n=83) troponin measurement was compared to check whether the included population was prognostically representative of the entire cohort of patients admitted due to COVID-­19 during the study period. 103 patients died in those in whom troponin was measured compared with 20 deaths in those without a troponin measurement, with a p-v­ alue of 0.191 using the 2 test.
The baseline demographics and clinical characteristics for all patients included are shown in table 1. There

were more men than women in the troponin-­negative group while the opposite was true for the troponin-­ positive group. Around one-­third of patients had a black or Asian ethnicity. Hypertension was the most frequent recorded comorbidity, followed by diabetes mellitus in our study population. Hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease and chronic kidney disease were significantly more prevalent in the troponin-­ positive group. Higher use of medications in the troponin-­ positive group such as angiotensin-c­onverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reflected the increased prevalence of these comorbidities. Chest pain was uncommon in both groups. However, there was no significant difference in presenting symptom between the two groups.
Inpatient investigations High D-d­ imer, low lymphocyte count and high CRP was evident in both the troponin positive and troponin negative result (see table 2). 73% of patients over 65 years old had a positive troponin. There were a low number of CT pulmonary angiograms performed in this cohort. In addition, only around one-t­ hird of troponin-p­ ositive cases had a transthoracic echocardiogram completed. Reported abnormalities on imaging included reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, regional wall motion abnormalities and pericardial effusion.
Outcomes and inpatient management Table 3 shows the cumulative outcomes in the troponin positive and negative groups. The average age of patients who died was 74.0 (95% CI 71.5 to 76.5) years, while the average age in those who survived was 60.4 (95% CI 58.3 to 62.5) years (see figure 1 panel A). Death rates were higher in the troponin-­positive group. 2 test showed that survival of patients with COVID-1­ 9 was significantly higher in those with a negative troponin compared with those with a positive troponin (p=3.23×10-10). Mean initial troponin in patients who survived was 70.0 ng/L (95% CI 5.6 ng/L to 134.4 ng/L), while in those who died it was 131.4 ng/L (95% CI 78.9 ng/L to 183.9 ng/L) (see figure 1 panel B). A

Mann-­Whitney U test showed that initial troponin was significantly higher in those who died (p=2.24×10-12) compared with those who were alive. COVID-1­ 9 was the primary cause of death in both patient populations on the medical certificate for cause of death. Only a minority of troponin-­positive patients had cardiovascular disease mentioned on the death certificate (2.4% in part 1, and 15.5% in part 2). A higher proportion of the troponin-p­ ositive group received medical management for acute coronary syndrome (ACS); however, only one patient subsequently went on to have percutaneous coronary intervention.
Predictors of outcome Table 4 shows the results of the univariate and multivariate regression in our patient cohort. A histogram of the odds ratios (ORs) for the multivariate analysis can be seen in figure 2. Five patients were excluded from the final analysis due to having type I myocardial infarctions. In the multivariate logistical regression, lung disease, age, troponin positivity and CPAP were all significantly associated with death, with an AUC of 0.889, sensitivity of 0.886 and specificity of 0.629 for the model. Within this model, troponin positivity was independently associated with short term mortality (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.34 to 6.61, p=0.008). A Cox proportional-­hazards model confirmed the same significant associations with mortality as the logistic regression but showed additionally a significant association between creatinine and mortality. The univariate logistical regression using only initial troponin positivity had an AUC of 0.683. When only patients aged under 65 years were included in the multivariate model only use of CPAP, smoking status and lung disease were significantly associated with mortality. A Kaplan-M­ eier survival analysis confirmed the significant increased mortality in the troponin-­positive group (online supplemental materials).
DISCUSSION In this retrospective cross-s­ ectional study, we have demonstrated that a positive initial troponin was independently

associated with short-­term mortality in patients hospitalised with COVID-1­ 9. These findings line up with other studies and meta-­analyses.2-4 10-12 Papargeorgeiou et al13 similarly reported the association between a positive initial troponin and mortality across several London hospitals covering different geographical areas. Our data showed that 103 patients died, representing a third of the cohort, which may be higher than other published COVID-­19 reports. Other studies have found correlation between elevated troponin and more severe disease, ICU admission and the requirement for non-­invasive and mechanical ventilation.2 3 11 12 14 We did not find any significant between group differences in CPAP use, ICU admission and intubation between troponin positive and negative groups. However, this observation was based on relatively

small numbers of patients and should be interpreted with caution. Troponin measurements appear to be helpful in identification of those at risk of death from COVID-1­ 9. Even in non-­COVID-­19 hospitalised populations in the UK, elevated troponin has been seen to be associated with mortality suggesting that myocardial injury forms part of the clinical picture in other non-c­ ardiac severe illness.15
In addition to troponin, increasing age, the need for CPAP and underlying lung disease were also independently associated with increased mortality in our cohort. Increasing mortality with increasing age is clearly correlated.16 Lung disease, in particular COPD and interstitial lung disease, has been shown to modestly increase the risk of severe COVID-1­ 9 in the UK, although asthma does not appear to confer increased risk.17 The use of

CPAP was associated with an increased risk of mortality in our cohort suggesting another interesting clinical marker to identify patients at higher risk of mortality. The scope of this study was not to determine the effectiveness of CPAP; patients who require CPAP are clinically more unstable with severe disease and are more likely to deteriorate. The clear benefits of CPAP have been outlined in other studies designed as such.18
In our cohort, initial troponin was positive in 39% of patients in whom it was measured and 31% overall. Data from Wuhan initially outlined an incidence of 12%-27%.2 3 Subsequent studies from western countries show a broad prevalence of myocardial injury. In general, there appears to be higher frequency of

troponin elevation in hospitalised patients in European and USA populations, when compared with China, with an incidence rising above 50% in some instances.8 13 A large meta-­analysis including 49 studies from a combination of the USA, Europe and China showed an incidence of troponin elevation in 20.8% when measured in the first 24 hours, rising to 34.2% when measured during the ongoing hospital stay.4 Troponin values may change during the course of the disease. These variations in the frequency of troponin elevation may relate to differing disease durations prior to medical evaluation with early sampling resulting in under-e­ stimation of the frequency of myocardial injury. Our finding appears to be broadly in line with the prevalence expected from the heterogenous evidence base.
Hypertension, chronic kidney disease, ischaemic heart disease and heart failure were all more common in the troponin-p­ositive group in our cohort, which is similarly seen in the large cohorts from the USA.12 These comorbidities have been all found to be associated with increased risk of death COVID-1­ 9 in large studies, and similarly, we found a higher prevalence in those that died.19 20 Dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) may be implicated here. Binding of the virus to ACE2 with resultant loss of ACE2 may lead to increases in angiotensin II thereby contributing to endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation and thrombosis.21 The dysfunctional RAAS seen in such

comorbidities may lead to susceptibility to severe disease via further disruption through viral binding of ACE2. A significant percentage of the patients in those with positive troponins had chronic kidney disease. A correlation in declining estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and rising serum troponin is known and may account for some of the elevated troponin levels. However, there was a broad spread of patients across chronic kidney disease groups 1-5, so it is unlikely to explain troponin elevation in the entirety of this group.22
Severe COVID-1­ 9 is often characterised by a cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may be another factor implicated in myocardial injury as CRP levels have been seen to correlate with troponin levels.2 In our univariate analysis of predictors of mortality, a positive CRP was associated with mortality in keeping with previous studies. High levels of circulating cytokines may have a direct effect on the

myocardium, as well as contributing to generalised endothelial dysfunction and coagulopathy.23 This prothrombotic state found in COVID-1­ 9 can contribute to various sequalae that can lead to myocardial strain and injury including pulmonary emboli.24 Pulmonary embolism has been reported in 13% of patients in a large systematic review; in our sample, the prevalence of pulmonary embolism was rather lower, and prevalence was higher in the troponin-n­ egative group.25 However, the number of CT pulmonary angiography scans performed in our sample was also low so our results should be interpreted with caution.
Case series of occlusive coronary disease in COVID-1­ 9 exist in the literature; however, it appears to be relatively uncommon.26 This is reflected in our sample with only one patient proceeding to invasive coronary angiogram and only nine of the patients with positive troponin receiving medical ACS treatment during their admission. In ST elevation myocardial infarction associated with COVID-­19 a higher thrombotic burden has been noted during angiography, suggesting that the prothrombotic state may be a contributing factor to coronary occlusio; however, clear causation is not yet proved.27 There are case reports of myocarditis but the prevalence in autopsy studies appears to be relatively low with one compilation of autopsy studies estimating histopathological evidence myocarditis at 7.2%, being functionally significant in <2%.28 In our cohort, we did not identify any cases of myocarditis. However, we acknowledge that myocarditis is recognised to rarely occur following COVID-­19 infection and vaccination, but this association needs to be further investigated.29 Acute COVID-­19 myocarditis has been detected on cardiac MRI, but we were unable to correlate this in our study.7

Only around a third of those with a positive troponin underwent echocardiography in our cohort. The prevalence of regional wall motion abnormalities, impaired left ventricular systolic function and pericardial effusion were proportionally higher in the troponin-p­ositive group. These findings have previously been characterised as part of the clinical picture of myocardial injury in COVID-­ 19.30 However, our results on echocardiographic findings should be approached with caution as the number of patients in the troponin-p­ositive group undergoing echocardiography was three times higher than that in the negative group.
There are some limitations to our findings. First, our sample was a small retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-1­ 9 requiring hospitalisation. Second, within this cohort of patients, a significant proportion (approximately 20%) did not have blood troponin levels measured and were excluded from the analysis. These results reflect outcomes in patients prior to the availability of vaccination and before other evidence based interventions were available to hospitalised patients. Furthermore, there were differences in timing of sampling of blood troponin between patients during their hospital stay. Also, potentially important data such as body mass index was not available in this dataset.
CONCLUSIONS Troponin positivity was independently associated with increased short-­term mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-1­9 during the first wave of the pandemic. The mechanisms implicated in myocardial injury in COVID-1­ 9 are not fully understood and require further investigation.

SURGERY.
On Broncliotomy in (Edematous Laryngeal Angina. By M. Sestieh. This is a very elaborate and valuable paper, having for its object the inculcation of a more frequent recourse to operative procedures lor the relief 01 (edematous laryngeal angina, commonly called oedema of the glottis; a term objected to by Dr. Sostier, inasmuch as the arytcnoid-epiglotteal folds arc much oltener the seat of the disease than the rima glottidis. The author bases his remarks upon 1G8 cases of the disease which lie has collected, in 30 of which the operation was performed, often under very unfavorable circumstances, saving life in 13 and prolouging it in 8, although death eventually occurrcd. He minutely analyses the circumstances under which the disease occurrcd, and exhibits the amount of success to be expected from the operation, accordingly as it is applied to the different categories into which lie has distributed the eases. He also compares the results obtainable from it in this and in other affections; and finds that, while the operation for oedema is less successful than when it is undertaken for erythematous laryngitis, or for the removal of foreign bodies, it is more so than when performed for croup. From his investigations it results, that the probability of its success is very much dependent upon the prior healthy state of the larynx, and the fact of the patient net suffering from other serious disease. But lie believes it should still be performed even when the oedema is consecutive to severe laryngeal disease, though it

has then succecded only in 1 out of 19 cases, during convalescence from other disease though it has failed in 4 out of G such cases, and when concomitant with various other diseases, though it lias then failed in 15 out of 17 times. In fact, he would recommend it in all cases, save when the angina is the ultimate phenomenon of incurable and advanced disease, the fatal issue of which would be probably accelerated by it. In several such cases, however, the object would be only to prolong
life, and this should be distinctly stated: but in others, apparently desperate, nature's resources would be by it brought advantageously into play.
As to the epoch at which the operation should be undertaken, this must not be as soon as the disease is recognised, for in 28 well-marked cases it was cured by ordinary means; and these, when energetic, have several times proved of avail even after severe suffocative paroxysms and great intervening dyspnoea have become established. On the other hand, we must not wait until it is absolutely certain that the patient will speedily die unless the operation be performed, as he would then often die during or soon after it. We must not be deceived by the dangerous calm which follows prolonged suffocative paroxysm, and is only the precursor of speedy death. It is difficult to fix any precise period; but it may be laid down, that if in spite of active means rapidly employed, the difficulty of respiration continues to increase, the respiratory murmur heard by auscultation becomes more ancl more feeble, and the suffocative paroxysms are on the increase, the operation is urgently indicated; and it is far more safe to operate too soon than too late, success being proportionate to the early performance.
There are four circumstances under which the performance of the operation should be hastened. 1. The debility of the patient at the period of the invasion of the angina ; and doubtless this is the reason why it has so frequently failed, when had recourse to during convalescence from other diseases. The more enfeebled the patient prior to the invasion, the earlier should be the operation. 2. The presence of deep-seated lesions of the larynx prior to the invasion. As these have induced the cedema, so will they maintain it. 3. (Edema of the interior of the larynx. In 41 autopsies out of 107 collected by the author, partial intra-laryngeal cedema prevailed in 18, and complete in 23, the chordae vocales being almost always implicated in both. In four-sevenths of 57 cases of laryngeal cedema, in which the interior of the larynx has been described, this has been present. It adds much to the danger of the case, inasmuch as it is inaccessible to direct applications, and the close texture of the cellular tissue here causes the disease to yield less readily to indirect ones. Its diagnosis is therefore important, and is derived from observing (1), that it never occurs but in patients who were already ill from some cause when the oedema appeared; (2), when found in cedcmatous angina in connection with inflammation of the fauces, the patients have already suffered from some other forms of disease, and especially from serous diathesis; (3), it has been found in three sevenths of the cases of cedematous angina dependent upon laryngitis, and especially when the serous diathesis was present; (4), the facility of expiration, as contrasted with that of inspiration, characteristic ol ordinary cedcmatous laryngeal angina, was not observed in seven twelfths of the cases in which intra-laryngeal oedema was present ?the obstacle to respiration being then a more fixed one; (5), in 11 out of 12 cases of laryngeal oedema in which the fauccs were found infiltrated, the oedema was also intralaryngeal. 4. Rapidly increasing oedema of the soft parts of the neck, which renders the operation difficult or impossible.
M. Sestier recommends an operation, even if the patient seems in the agony of death, providing this depends upon the cedema itself, and not upon preceding irremediable disease. Cases are related of life being thus saved. Even when the patient is apparently dead, we must not always renounce the operation. A recovery under these circumstances occurred to M. Trousseau; and some of the patients who have died during the preparations for the operation, or just before the arrival of the surgeon, might probably have been saved. If during the operation the patient sink as if lifeless, the operation must be rapidly continued, and in this way two recoveries were procured.

Dit. Warren on Ligature of the Left Subclavian.

269

In this disease we should always carefully watch the patient, under the expectation of having to operate. 1. The course of the disease is frequently excessively rapid. In more than half of G5 cases in which no operation was performed, death occurred at various periods within 24 hours. 2. Certain forms are especially remarkable for their rapid course, as those dependent on inflammation of the fauces, on anasarca after scarlatina, on cachectic diathesis; as also when consecutive to a wound of the neck, with infiltration of blood into the cellular tissue external to the larynx. On the other hand, its progress is slower when it is dependent on deep-seated laryngeal lesion. 3. When the disease assumes the continuous form, it is much more rapid in its course than is the paroxysmal. 4. Sometimes while the patient's condition seems ameliorated, he yet dies suddenly amidst paroxysmal suffering. A remarkable calm after severe paroxysm is sometimes a precursor of death. 5. The nocturnal aggravation of the disease is indubitable, and calls for watching.
Among the varieties of operative procedure, the author prefers crico-tracheotomy, by which the difficulty often arising from an (edematous state of the neck is avoided, and the penetration of air into the veins (this accident occurred twice in the 3G operations, although no mention is made of it in 333 cases of bronchotomy for other affections,) and of blood into the air-passages rendered less likely. It is far easier than tracheotomy, and fitter for the inexpert called in on emergency. He gives minute directions for the performance of the operation; but as these do not apply especially to this disease, we need do no more than refer to them.?Archives Generates, torn, xxiii, pp. 385, 420 ; torn, xxiv, pp. 35, 297, and 441. Bulletin de VAcad., torn, xvi, p. 117.
[We regret that the great length of M. Sestier's Essay prevents our reproducing some of the statistical data upon which his conclusions arc formed. Although, as in all similar inquiries, the absence of records of many facts that have occurred prevents these from assuming the character of absoluteness, enough is assured to justify having a more frequent recourse to the operation in a disease so dangerous, and so often unamenable to both local and general measures. The paper also contains much incidental information of value, which we have not space to notice.]

On the Use of Collodion in Ingrowing Nail. By M. Meynier. M. Meynier treats this affection by pressing down the fleshy portion, and pouring in between this and the edge of the nail a small quantity of collodion, which soon solidifies, induces rapid cicatrisation of the ulceration, and, when the disease does not arise from an abnormal shape of the nail, procures a cure. M. H. Larrey has recently tried the plan in five cases, and succeeded in four of these.?Bull, de Therap., torn, xl, p. 186.
On the Ligature of the left Subclavian, with Post-mortem Appearances. By J. Mason Warren, m.d.
In the Periscope of Yol. Ill, p. 539, will be found a short account of this operation, as performed for subclavian aneurism by Dr. Warren. The artery pursued an abnormal course obliquely across the neck, parallel to the edge of the trapezius, and in company with the cervical plexus of axillary nerves. The ligature was applied between the scaleni, and did not separate until the ninety-sixth day. The patient died of typhoid fever twelve months after the_ operation. The tumour at the site of the aneurism had disappeared. The subclavian, from its origin to the internal edge of the scalenus retained its normal size, but suddenly terminated there, and became converted into a flat cord of little else than condensed cellular tissue, about one inch and a half in length. The aneurismal sac had contracted to about double the size of the normal vessel, the artery regaining its natural size where embraced by the two heads of the median nerve. The supra-scapular, dorived from the transverse cervical, and much enlarged, had, by traversing the external surface of the sac, given

rise at one time, by its pulsations, to the fear of a return of aneurismal pulsation. The vessels of the thyroid axis were double their normal size. The internal mammary was enlarged, and given off by the thyroid; and it was through this, by inosculations of the intercostals with the thoracic, and of the posterior scapular with the subscapular, that the collateral circulatiou had apparently been accomplished.?

On the Reduction of Old Dislocations. By M. Malgaigne. M. Malgaigne recently alluded to a case of dislocation of the humerus of four months' standing, which lie had reduced with the pulleys; but the reality of which reduction M. Lenoir had doubted, from the fact of finding the head of the humerus projecting somewhat more forward than 011 the sound side, and considerably more than after the reduction of a recent dislocation. The woman, however, when visited five months after the reduction, was found to have the pcrfect use of her arm. M. Malgaigne observed, that after the reduction of old dislocations, especially of the humerus, but sometimes also of the hip and elbow, the region does not usually reassume its normal form,?the head of the humerus, e. g., sometimes seeming farther removed from the acromion, and sometimes projecting forwards; while in subacromial dislocation, reduccd after a long period, a slight posterior projection remains. If the dislocation has not been very old, these projections may disappear afterwards; but sometimes they persist, without, however, the reduction having been incomplete, or the limb being prevented from recovering its motions.?

On Ligature in Erections of the Penis. By M. Gistacii. Founding his recommendation upon ninety cases, M. Gistach directs the individual, in any case in which nocturnal erection from any cause is apprehended, on retiring to rest, to draw the prepuce over the glans, and to fasten it in front of this by a ligature applied only with sufficient firmness to prevent its retraction.
He declares the method to be infallible. Diurnal erections that have commenced
may be at once arrested, if the attempt to draw the prepuce over the glans be made soon enough to avoid compressing this part, which would only increase the suffering.?Bull, de Therap., t. xxxix, p. 475.

On Median Lithotomy. By Professor Rizzoli. The perineal urethra being well projected-out by a very convex sound, the operator commcnces his incision of the superficial coverings a few lines behind the base of the scrotum, and carries it to the margin of the anus. Passing the nail of his left thumb or finger under the bulb of the urethra in order to protect it, lie feels for the grove of the sound, and penetrates the anterior part of the membranous portion of the urethra with his lithotome; the ligature or torsion being applied to any of the arterial branches proceeding towards the bulb, which, owing to their abnormal development, may bleed too ireely. Having implanted the point of his bistoury within the origin of the membranous portion, in order to prevent any injury to the rectum, the surgeon now takes the sound from the assistant, and raising the handle to a right angle with the pubes, enables the instrument to slide under the pubes, rendering the membranous portion prominent, and its division easier, -without injury to the rectum. The incision slioidd be carried far enough to scarify the edge of the prostate, as urinary effusions into the cellular tissue of the anterior walls of the pelvis are much more likely to occur when it is limited to the membranous portion, and the dilatation of the part by the passage of large calculi is then more difficult. The incision completed, the operator passes his index finger into the wound, with the palmar surface upwards, guiding it along the groove of the sound into the bladder, and making it serve as a conductor for the passage

of the forccps. If the surgeon discover for the first time, during the operation, that lie lias to do with a very large calculus, it is better to break it prior to removal,
for which purposes Professor llizzoli has contrived an instrument. He believes the advantage attendant upon this mode of operation to consist in
avoiding wounding the bladder, rectum, bulb, vasa deferentia, the great periuaeal arteries, or the prostatic venous plexus. He has as yet operated in this manner only upon eight patients, but in all with success. In one of his cases there had been originally two calculi in the bladder, one of which was discharged by an aperture produced by Nature in the perinaium.?Bulletino clelle Sc. Med. vol. xvii,

On Effusion of Blood into the Interior of the JEye. By M. Tavignot.

If in these eases the eye is in a normal state, in all respects save the hypremia,

the blood will be most readily absorbed under the most simple treatment; but if

the organ is the seat of severe pain, congestion, or inflammation, it may persist

indefinitely until these conditions are removed. The affection may be treated of ac-

cording to the nature of its cause.

1. Essential hyphemia. This is of rare occurrence, and consists in an effusion

of blood into the eye, in the ordinary circumstances of health, and without appreci-

able causc, not being symptomatic of a general disorder of the economy, as scor-

butus, or dependent on deviation of menstrual action. A case occurred at the

Necker, in 1843, in a woman, set. G5, presenting no sign whatever of disease, and

who was unable to assign any causc, notwithstanding the most careful interrogation.

She had complained for two days, rather of uneasiness in the eye than of pain, and

no signs of contusion were present. The organ was in a completely normal con-

dition, except that the lower third of the anterior chamber was occupied with

blood. Mere purgatives were given, and in twelve days the blood had all dis-

appeared.

2. Traumatic hypcemia is of more frequent occurrence than all the other

varieties put together, and may be induced either by a cutting instrument or con-

tusion. In itself the effusion is of no consequence, the degree ot injury the different

tissues have undergone being the really important point. The harmlessness of

almost all lesions of the iris, except puncture, is remarkable; and thus sections,

lacerations, and contusions of the part may occur without phlegmasia being induced.

A case in point is related. A quarryman was struck while blasting a rock. The

eyelids were ecchymosed, but both the sclerotica and cornea were in a normal

condition. The anterior chamber being full of blood, the patient could not dis-

tinguish objects, but complained of a sense of distension rather than of pain.

Being young and strong, he was bled and purged, and in five days no blood re-

mained. The iris was now observed to be separated from the ciliary body on the

inner side, the upper side, and the external and somewhat inferior side, so that

three artificial pupils resulted from this singular lesion, the natural one still being

preserved.

3. Inflammatory hypcemia. Von Ammon has described the escape of blood from

the inflamed iris, and its accumulation in the anterior chamber, and Lawrence says

the inflammation need not be very severe to produce it. It is of importance to

remember that this may be one of the initial symptoms of iritis. The author relates

an interesting case occurring in a lady, set. 50, in whom, twenty-six days after a

successful operation for artificial pupil, he broke up a soft lenticular cataract

30th July, leaving the fragments in situ. She went on very well until the 12th

August, when, after errors of diet, the iris became vascular, and a bloody dew ex-

uded from its surface, a small collection of blood being also observed in the lower

part of the chambcr. On the 14th and 15th pus became mingled with this and

by the IGth predominated; but prompt salivation soon induced deposit. M. Tavignot has met with three analogous cases.

occurred in a patient suffering from a deformity of pupil produced by adhesion of the iris to a cicatrix of the cornea, and belladonna having been dropped into the eye for a considerable period, the pupil became rounded while the anterior chamber was found to contain blood, which had proceeded from rupture of vessels during the forced dilatation of the pupil, by means of the belladonna. It was soon reab-
sorbed. In the other case the effusion was consequent upon the sudden destruction of an adhesion which had taken place between the iris and an opaque capsule.
5. Hypeemia from ulceration. But one example of this has occurred to the author. A man, ret. 40, suffered from severe pain and obstinate vomiting, after depression of cataracts, 19th of June. On the left side the lens in part remounted, nearly obliterating the pupil, and causing severe pain. By the 20th of August the pain had become violent, and a very large collection of blood took place in the anterior chamber, but, in a day or two, was in part resorbed. The rest remaining stationary, an opening was made 14th September, and it was discharged in a fluid state. An erosion or ulceration was afterwards perceived on the inner part of the lesser circle of the iris, induced, apparently, by the pressure of the reascended lens.

On the Employment of Collodion in the Production of Artificial Ectropium. By M. Cuniek.
effect,'Tiie obstinacy with which adhesions are almost invariably reproduced after the
division of the tissues, constituting symblepharon, is known to all surgeons; and numerous have been the operative procedures contrived to prevent this. To all these, M. Cunier prefers the employment of collodion. After dividing or dissecting away the adhesions, the eyelid is maintained everted, by connecting it with bandalettes of linen soaked in collodion to the frontal region, or the cheek, as the case may be. In three cases in which the plan has been tried, it has quite succeeded. In two only, the extroversion was maintained permanently for nine days, then for some hours during the day, and all night for three weeks, and then occasionally. In the other, a much shorter space of time was required. The bands require readjusting every morning; and the eye is protected by allowing a compress to hang down before it. In the same way, the conjunctival bridles, which are so common in Belgium, as a result of the incautious use of caustic, may be treated; and the
management of ankyloblepharon is thus also simplified and rendered more certain. Dr. Cunier has also employed this mode of eversion in the management of voluminous granulations and vegetations?especially those of the upper lid; and the
result of six months' observation convinces him that cauterization by the nitrate of silver, and the application of the acetate of lead, exerts a more rapid and complete
in proportion to the time the eyelid is thus maintained continuously everted. In this way many old cases have been unexpectedly benefited.?Annates d'Oculistique, t. xxiv, pp. 186-94.
On Fracture of the Thyroid Cartilage. By M. Eichmann. In this paper M. Eichmann relates the pathological appearances found in one case, and the particulars of the recovery which took place in another. In the first, the child died with the symptoms of suffocation from oedema glottidis, laryngotomy having been refused. A double fracture was found,?one producing a detachment of the arytenoid cartilage from the upper edge of the cricoid, and the other penetrating the thyroid at the point of insertion of the thyro-arytcnoid ligaments. Extensive oedema, consisting of sero-purulent infiltration, had very rapidly formed.
The cause of the fracture is not stated.
The second case occurred in a girl, ret. 9, wno lell upon the sharp edge of an iron chest. Among other injuries, the reporter found a complete fracture of the thyroid, which divided the cartilage along its middle on one side, and extended somewhat over

the other. There was much displacement inwards, and so much bleeding, that an arterial branch, apparently the superior thyroid, was tied. After a while, convulsions came on, together with a violent cough, which expelled frothy blood from the mouth. Some leeches and an anodyne emulsion were ordered; but the cough recurred every few minutes, accompanied by a frightful sifflement and rale. Respiration now became difficult, the eyes projected, and the veins of the neck were distended from the increasing impediment to the return of the blood. As life was obviously in danger, laryngotomy, by means of an aperture in the crico-thyroid ligament, was resorted to, and gave rise to great relief. As, however, the space between the cartilages was unusually small in this child, a section of two lines of the anterior arched portion of the thyroid was made, and a bent polypus-forceps being passed in the dislocated portion, was carefully elevated. The artificial opening was purposely kept open for a fortnight, and air only entirely ceased to issue hence at a considerably later period. The cartilage was quite healed in six weeks, the voice being then unaffected, and the respiration only slightly embarrassed.?Med.
Zeit., 1850, No. 29.

On secondary Syphilitic Sores of the Penis. By Dr. Gambebini.
Dr. Gambebini communicates notes of several cases, in which he believes that
syphilitic sores appeared on the glans or prepuce, as a secondary, not a primary symptom. One of the chief distinctive characters is, that while a primary sore commences as a pustule, a constitutional one commences with a circumscribed, deep, almost purple redness, which is soon followed by abrasion of the epithelium, and ulceration, as in syphilitic sores of the throat. Compared with the primary sore, the secondary one is of very short duration; and it does not give rise to a venereal bubo. Thus, when we see a man with a sore on his penis, we are_not at once to conclude that he is the subject of a new infection, but should inquire into the history
of its appearance.
He takes this opportunity of stating, that of 100 cases of constitutional syphilis observed promiscuously in the Venereal Hospital at Bologna, some oi the symptoms indicated by Bicord as tertiary, were developed in 52, without any secondary ones having intervened between them and the primary. In the other IS, too, the secondary were in several cases so rapidly followed by tertiary, that the two might be considered contemporary. He believes that mercury is the most important medicine, not only for secondary but tertiary symptoms, since three fourths of the patients are cured by it, and the other fourth, who recovered under iodide of potassium, have, for the most part, formerly derived advantage from the mercury, ana now apply on account of relapse of the tertiary symptoms.
Other points, in which he differs from M. Bicord, are constituted by his belief in the possibility of the occurrence of secondary symptoms after gonorrhoea, independently of any urethral ideeration, and of the occasional production of primary venereal bubo, unpreceded by sores on the penis,?the "bubo d'emblee" of the Brench. Of both these circumstances he relates some cases in this paper.?Bulletino delle Sc. Med. vol. xvi, pp. 351?3S1.

Art. V.- Sound: A Course of Eight Lectures delivered at the Royal Institution of Great Britain. By John Tykdall.
LL.D., F.R.S.
These eight lectures on Sound, intended to interest not only those who possess special scientific culture, but all intelligent persons, have already attained popularity, and are likely to be widely read and respected by medical men of a physiological
turn. The author informs us that he has made much use of
Helmlioltz's work, ' Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen/ that he has been assisted, in going through the press and otherwise, by English and German friends, and that "one celebrated German friend" had read through all the proof sheets. Thus when it is also borne in mind that the subject is a pet one of so able a man as Dr. Tyndall, it will be perceived that this book must carry with it an unusual weight of authority. Besides, it abounds

with excellent woodcuts, and its style is charming. It will, none doubt less than ourselves, be justly treasured not only as a pleasant, but a safe guide in acoustics.
On the other hand, -\ve regard any statement made in a book so diligently supervised and polished, should it be inaccurate, as particularly detrimental to the spread of correct knowledge, and we therefore think it imperative on us as physiologists to venture to demur to a few statements that fairly fall within our province. At page 75 we read :?
"Dr. Wollaston was expert in closing the Eustachian tube, and leaving the space behind the tympanic membrane occupied by either compressed or rarefied air. He was thus able to cause his deafness to continue for any required time without any effort on his part, always, however, abolishing it by the act of swallowing. A sudden concussion may produce deafness by forcing air either into or out of the drum of the ear. In the summer of 1858 I was on the Fee Alp, in Switzerland, where, jumping from a cliff on to what I supposed to be a deep snowdrift, 1 came into rude collision with a rock, which the snow barely covered. The sound of the wind, the rush of the glacier torrents, and all the other noises which a sunny day awakes upon the mountains, instantly ceased. I could hardly hear the sound of my guide's voice. This deafness continued for half'-an-hour, at the end of which time a suitable act opened the Eustachian tube, and restored, with the quickness of magic, the innumerable murmurs
which filled the air around me."

We would ask for a reconsideration of this account. The
author has just described the Eustachian tube as keeping itself closed, and only opened by means of muscles in the act of swallowing ; but Wollaston never suspected but that it is naturally patent, and that it can only be closed artificially by the swelling of its wall on the diminution of the air-pressure usually there present ; to him, unless Dr. Tyndall, which we cannot think, had
some other source of information than Wollaston's paper in the
' Philosophical Transactions,' the experiment of retaining compressed air in the drum was unknown. It was only this ignorance of the fact that the tube, when passive, is shut, that led Wollaston to imagine that his powers of exhausting the air in the drum (causing the tubes to more completely collapse) by a forced inspiration with shut nose and mouth excelled those of other people. There is no reason to suppose that he could perform
any particular feat in this way. Indeed, Dr. Tyndall's own tubes seem to be at least as well able to keep closed with unequal aerial pressure in the fauces and tympana, for they are
related to have so remained for half an hour. But we own to be at a loss to understand his adventure. He expresses no
opinion whether the concussion had increased or diminished the

quantity of air in liis drums. It must have been easy to have observed which event had happened, and yet it seems that it ?was only inferred from the effects that one or other had occurred. As the concussion operated perpendicularly to the paths of the two tubes, it would not directlxj tend to knock air either into or out of the drums; and certainly we cannot suppose that one drum was partially emptied and the other over-filled,?what happened to one happened to both. There would be, perhaps, 011 the sudden arrest of motion through the feet a tendency to send the air in the lungs towards the bottom, and withdraw
some from the throat, and thus from the drums. But then the nostrils, if not the mouth, would supply a current of air, and swallowing would not take place at the instant of collision to
open the Eustachian tubes?tubes too minute, when fully open, to permit an instantaneous escape of much air. In short, it is inconceivable that the quantity of air in the drums could be affected by an accident having far less tendency to lessen the air in the fauces than an ordinary act of inspiration ; and an act of swallowing would have been sure to have quickly restored the aerial equilibrium, could such a thing have been. There is a mistake, we are convinced, somewhere, a lapse of memory, the shock on the nerves in scenes too exciting for careful observation, or transient confusion in the sensorium. The remarks are given by Dr. Tyndall in support of Wollaston's view, that a tense membrana tympani is unfitted for hearing low sounds, though it is fitted for hearing high ones as well or better than a slack
membrane. However, our author seems to have been deaf to all the mountain sounds, various as they were, some of which may be presumed to be of high tone, and thus gives only a dubious support to Wollaston. We cavil at these statements because the correctness of Wollaston's observations as to the effect of a tense
membrane upon the hearing of acute sounds has been disputed,
and with sufficient force to render it desirable to have his ex-
periments repeated by dispassionate observers. Besides, Wollaston's observation of the different ranges of
tones that are audible to different individuals, and which, he thought, indicated the different degrees of tension of their tympanic membranes, is now being used to support a theory that (p. 324) there is a lute of 3000 strings in the human ear that is adapted to the hearing of at least so many tones. In individuals the scope of this organ is supposed to differ, and to more properly account for Wollaston's observation. There is no impossi-
bility, or even improbability, in this idea; but we always advise caution in deciding by the aid of such comparisons. The ear is a
complex organ, and many of its parts may, if altered, produce similar results as to audition, and those who make such com-

Anxiolytic Action of Taurine via Intranasal Administration in Mice

Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Metabolic Diseases Research Laboratory, School of Dentistry, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Republic of Korea

Abstract
Taurine has a number of beneficial pharmacological actions in the brain such as anxiolytic and neuroprotective actions. We explored to test whether taurine could be transported to the central nervous system through the intranasal route. Following intranasal administration of taurine in mice, elevated plus maze test, activity cage test and rota rod test were carried out to verify taurine's effect on anxiety. For the characterization of potential mechanism of taurine's anti-anxiety action, mouse convulsion tests with strychnine, picrotoxin, yohimbine, and isoniazid were employed. A significant increase in the time spent in the open arms was observed when taurine was administered through the nasal route in the elevated plus maze test. In addition, vertical and horizontal activities of mice treated with taurine via intranasal route were considerably diminished. These results support the hypothesis that taurine can be transported to the brain through intranasal route, thereby inducing anti-anxiety activity. Taurine's anti-anxiety action may be mediated by the strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor as evidenced by the inhibition of strychnine-induced convulsion.

INTRODUCTION
Taurine, 2-aminoethane sulfonic acid, is classified as a -amino acid. It has unique structural features such as the presence of sulfonic group and its -form configuration (Zhang and Kim, 2007).
Though taurine is present in the body, its supply from diet is necessary due to the relatively low activity of the enzyme cysteinsulfinic acid decarboxylase that is the major regulator of taurine biosynthesis. Taurine is biosynthesized from cysteine and methionine mostly in the liver and synthesized taurine is transported to other organs through the taurine transporter (Huxtable and Barbeau, 1976; Huxtable, 1986).
Strikingly, taurine is present in the brain in a large amount and it exerts many important neuronal functions such as anticonvulsant, regulation of neuronal excitability, learning and memory formation, anti-aggressiveness, enhancing CNS development and anti-alcoholic effect (Huxtable, 1992).
There is an interesting proposal that taurine and its derivative glutaurine could work as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator. Furthermore, taurine plays important roles in regulating the structural stability of cell membrane as well as depolarization-associated calcium channel activity (Kuriyama, 1980; Lin et al., 1983; Moran et al., 1988; Sturman, 1993).

The physiological importance of taurine was further supported by the study with taurine deficiency: generation of epilepsy is associated with taurine deficiency (Birdsall, 1998).
Taurine has been found to have potential anxiolytic effects in animal models (Chen et al., 2004; Kong et al., 2006) and zebrafish models (Rosemberg et al., 2012; Fontana et al., 2016, 2019; Mezzomoa et al., 2016); however, its exact mechanism of action remains to be fully characterized.
Benzodiazepines have long been used for the treatment of anxiety; however, various unwanted side effects have been reported such as memory impairment, addiction problem, and muscle relaxation. Thus, it will be necessary to develop new drugs with fewer side effects for the safety of patients. Considering that taurine is an agonist of strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors present in the rat striatum (Sergeeva and Haas, 2001), there is a good possibility that taurine could interact with the glycine receptor in vivo. However, the use of taurine for the brain is extremely difficult due to its poor penetration rate into the brain: taurine has a strong hydrophilicity and has sulfonic acid instead of carboxylic acid which makes it very hard to penetrate the blood brain barrier (Chung et al., 2012). Recently, intranasal administration methods have been used as an alternative route for the efficient delivery of bioactive molecules into the brain. Numerous studies have been

reported dealing with the delivery of neuropeptides and proteins to the brain via nasal route (Kamei and Takeda-Morishita, 2015). Intranasal delivery of peptides has been employed for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (Meredith et al., 2015). It could allow for taurine to bypass the blood brain barrier, and thereby taurine could enter CNS via other routes such as trigeminal nerve and intercellular cleft in the olfactory epithelium (Kozlovskaya et al., 2014; Lochhead and Thorne, 2015).
In the present study, the possibility of nasal delivery of taurine to the CNS has been tested. We have presented evidence that taurine could be delivered to the brain, causing anti-anxiety action.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Male ICR mice were purchased from Hanlim Experimental Animals Co (Hwaseong, Korea). Male ICR (25-30 g, 6 weeks old) mice were caged in a temperature (22 ± 2°C) and ventilation-controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle. A standard pellet diet and tap water were supplied ad libitum. Throughout the experiments, animals were processed according to the Animal Care and Use Guidelines issued by Kyung Hee University (Seoul, Korea). All experiment protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Kyung Hee University [KHUASP(SE)-15-114]. After one week of acclimation period, animals were used for the experiment. Strychnine, picrotoxin, yohimbine and isoniazid were purchased from Tocris (Minneapolis, MN, USA).
Intranasal taurine delivery to mice
Intranasal (IN) delivery of taurine was carried out as essentially described by Marks et al (2009). Briefly, mice were hand-restrained, placed in a supine position, and given five 10 microliter drops of 80 g/l taurine or saline (0.9%), into both nares to give 200 mg of taurine per kg body weight through a micropipette (Pipetman P-20, Gilson, Inc., Middleton, WI, USA). Mice were given an extra ten microliter treatment drop if the subject forcibly ejected or sneezed out solution. Mice were held supine for 5-10 s after delivery to make sure all taurine containing solution was inhaled.

Elevated plus maze test
The plus maze, consisting of two open arms (60×5 cm) and two enclosed arms (60×5×20 cm) and elevated to a height of 60 cm, was used as described earlier by Pellow et al (1985). Mice were treated with saline or taurine (200 mg/kg, IN) and 60 min later were placed individually in the center of the plus maze, facing the enclosed arm. The time spent in the enclosed and open arms and the number of entries to the enclosed and open arms during the 5-min test period were recorded.
Activity Cage test
Groups of 10 mice with a weight between 35 and 40 g were used. They were treated intranasally with saline or taurine (200 mg/kg, IN). 1 h later, the mice were tested for spontaneous locomotor activity associated with anxiety for 4 min by the use of Activity Cage purchased from Ugo Basile (Gemonio, Italy) (Amos et al., 2004; Votava et al., 2005). Briefly, following the treatment of taurine or saline, the mice were evaluated for horizontal and vertical activities for 4 min according to the provider's instruction manual.
Rota rod test
Each mouse was trained to run in a Rota rod (3 cm in diameter, 15 rpm) until it could remain there for 300 s without falling. The mice were then evaluated in a Rota rod performance test for 300 s, 60 min after distilled water or taurine (200 mg/ kg, IN) treatment (Tsuda et al., 1996).
Passive avoidance test
The test was basically performed according to the stepthrough method described earlier (Park et al., 2000). The Gemini Avoidance System (SD Instruments, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for this experiment. The apparatus consisted of a two-compartment acrylic box with a lightened compartment connected to a darkened one by an automatic guillotine door. Mice were placed in the lighted box for 300 s, then the guillotine door was opened. The mice, as soon as they entered the dark compartment, received a punishing electrical shock (0.3 mA, 1 s). The latency times for entering the dark compartment were measured in the training test and after 24 h in the retention test. The maximum entry latency allowed in the retention session was 180s (Mohamed et al., 2000). Taurine (200 mg/kg, IN) or distilled water were administered 60 min prior to the training session of passive avoidance test.

Strychnine-Induced convulsions
Groups of 10 mice with a weight between 35 and 40 g were used. They were treated intranasal with distilled water or taurine (200 mg/kg, IN). 1 h later the mice were injected with 2 mg/kg strychnine i.p. The time until occurrence of tonic extensor convulsion and death was noted during a 1-h period (Bigler, 1977).
Picrotoxin-Induced convulsions
Groups of 10 mice with a weight between 35 and 40 g were used. They were treated intranasal with distilled water or taurine (200 mg/kg, IN). 1 h later the mice were injected with 3.5 mg/kg picrotoxin s.c. The time until occurrence of clonic seizure was noted during a 30-min period (Usunoff et al., 1969).
Yohimbine-Induced convulsions
Groups of 10 mice with a weight between 35 and 40 g were used. They were treated intranasal with distilled water or taurine (200 mg/kg, IN). 1 h later the mice were injected with 45 mg/kg yohimbine s.c. The time until occurrence of clonic seizure during a 60-min period was recorded (Dunn and Fielding, 1987).
Isoniazid-Induced convulsions
Groups of 10 mice with a weight between 35 and 40 g were used. They were treated intranasal with distilled water or taurine (200 mg/kg, IN). 1 h later the mice were injected with 45 mg/kg isoniazid s.c. The time until occurrence of clonic and tonic seizures and the time to death were recorded during a 2-h period (Meredith et al., 2015).
Statistical analysis
Each value is expressed as the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) of multiple determinations. All statistical analyses were used Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Analysis of a non-parametric unpaired t-test were used. The differences were considered statistically significant at p<0.05.
RESULTS
Elevated plus maze test
Elevated plus maze test was employed to explore the potential anti-anxiety actions of intra nasally (IN) administered

taurine. There was no significant difference in terms of total arms entries (Fig. 1A) and total time spent in the arms (Fig. 1B) between control and taurine groups.
Administration of taurine (200 mg/kg, IN) caused a significant increase in the percent open arm entries (open arm/ total×100): control and taurine (200 mg/kg) were 28.7% and 45.7%, respectively (Fig. 1C). Percent time spent in open arms was also significantly increased by taurine treatment (200 mg/kg, IN): control and taurine (200 mg/kg) were 12.6% and 33.6%, respectively (Fig. 1D). The actual time spent in open arms in control group and taurine treated group was 0.49 min and 1.16 min, respectively (Fig. 1E). The actual number of entries in open arms in control group and taurine treated group was 3.43 min and 2.27 min, respectively (Fig. 1F).
Activity cage test
Activity cage tests are another widely accepted as an experimental tool to test anti-anxiety actions of drugs. Following taurine administration (200 mg/kg, IN), mice were delivered to the activity cage for 4 min, and evaluated for horizontal and vertical activities. Taurine treatment caused a decrease in the horizontal steps by 43%, and it also diminished the vertical steps by 81% as compared to controls (Fig. 2).
Rota rod test
To explore the potential effect of taurine on the muscle relaxation, rota rod test were performed. Taurine administration (200 mg/kg, IN) did not cause any significant changes on the rota rod test, suggesting it had little effect on muscle relaxation (Fig. 3).
Passive avoidance test
To evaluate taurine's potential effect on the memory formation, passive avoidance test was carried out. Taurine administration via intra nasal route (200 mg/kg, IN) did not change the retention times in the training and test session, suggesting it has little direct effect on the memory function (Fig. 4).
Convulsions test
Taurine, at a dose 200 mg/kg, increased the latency to the onset of the first clonic seizure caused by strychnine by 40% as compared to control (Fig. 5). Taurine prolonged the induction time of death by 20% as compared to control, (Fig. 5). However, taurine had little effect on the latency to the onset of convulsion caused by picrotoxin (Fig. 6) and yohimbine (Fig.

DISCUSSION
Taurine, as a derivative of cysteine, exerts a wide variety of pharmacological actions in the body including CNS effects such as neuroprotection and anti-anxiety. Taurine have been extensively studied by many investigators in peripheral tissues; however, its actions in the CNS were not fully understood. As an alternative route of taurine administration, the possibility of nasal delivery of taurine to the brain was tested. We present evidence that taurine is readily transported into the brain via intranasal delivery, causing anxiolytic effects.
Taurine, 2-aminoethane sulfonic acid, is an important amino acid derivative playing essential physiological roles in the body such as bile acid conjugation, osmoregulation, cardiovascular regulation, antioxidation etc. Interestingly, taurine can be transported to the brain and can induce a number of CNS actions including anti-anxiety effect. However, its poor transport to the brain has limited its clinical application. We have previously found that taurine administration via PER ORAL could induce significant anti-anxiety effect through the activation of strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor (Zhang and Kim, 2007): this prompted us to further investigate the possibility of intranasal delivery of taurine for its anti-anxiety action. The anxiolytic action of taurine via intranasal delivery was evidenced by the activity cage test as well as the elevated plus maze test. It has been suggested that a decrease of horizontal and vertical activity by an agent is well correlated with its anxiolytic action (Amos et al., 2005).
Spontaneous locomotor activity measured by the activity cage test is regarded as an index of the level of excitability of the CNS (Mansur et al., 1971). Drug that causes a decrease of spontaneous locomotor activity can be anxiolytic (Ozturk et al., 1996). In the activity cage test, taurine administration via intranasal route caused remarkable reduction of horizontal and vertical activities, suggesting taurine's anti-anxiety action. The activation of strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor by taurine could cause hyperpolarization of neuronal membrane via the receptor-associated chloride channels, which might lead

to the anxiolytic action. Elevated plus maze test is a commonly accepted tool for
the evaluation of anti-anxiety action (Pellow et al., 1985). It is well documented that anxiolytic molecules increase the time spent in open arm in the elevated plus maze test. Taurine's anti-anxiety action via intranasal delivery was clearly evident in the elevated plus maze test: the time spent in the open arm was significantly increased. Taurine administration via intranasal delivery has little effect on the muscle relaxation as shown by the Rota rod test. This feature of taurine is beneficial as compared to the conventional anxiolytic drug such as benzodiazepine which has muscle relaxation activity.
To explore the mechanism of taurine's anti-anxiety action caused by intranasal delivery, convulsions induced by strychnine, picrotoxin, yohimbine or isoniazid were tested. The doses of strychnine, picrotoxin, yohimbine and isoniazid employed in the convulsion tests are widely used for the study of anxiolytic effects of compounds (Costa et al., 1975a, 1975b; Dunn and Fielding, 1987).
GABAA receptor is a ligand-gated chloride channel which has multiple binding sites for picrotoxin, yohimbine as well as GABA (Leite and Cascio, 2001).
Anion-selective transmitter-gated ion channels of the cysloop super family contain GABAA receptors and strychninesensitive glycine receptors (Yevenes and Zeilhofer, 2011). The binding of GABA to GABAA receptor causes a conformational change of the receptor complex, resulting in the hyperpolarization of neuronal cells via opening the chloride channel. By contrast, binding of picrotoxin or yohimbine to the GABAA receptor complex blocks the opening of chloride channel, causing convulsion. Thus, the present results that intranasal administration of taurine had little effect on the picrotoxin- and yohimbine-induced convulsion clearly suggest that taurine's anti-anxiety action is not mediated by GABAA receptor. Since there is a possibility that taurine may affect the synthesis of GABA, isoniazid was employed. Isoniazid is a drug for the treatment of tuberculosis, but it also has been known to inhibit GABA synthesis and thereby inducing convulsion (Costa, 1975b).
When taurine was administered via intranasal route with the pretreatment of isoniazid, the convulsions induced by isoniazid were not affected. These results indicate that taurine has little effect on GABA synthesis process. Glycine receptor is another ligand-gated chloride channel which has a differ-

ent structure as compared to the GABAA receptor. Activation of glycine receptor by binding with glycine induces a conformational change on the receptor and subsequently opens the associated chloride channel, causing sedation (Graham et al., 1982).
Strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors are pentameric anion channel consisting of 1-4 and  (Lynch, 2004) and have a specific binding site for strychnine. When strychnine binds to the glycine receptor, it is inactivated with the associated chloride channel being closed, and eventually leading to convulsion. The strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors are expressed in various brain regions such as hippocampus, brain stem, spinal cord, cerebellum and retina (Legendre et al., 2009; Yevenes and Zeilhofer, 2011). They are playing important role in regulating respiratory rhythm, muscle tone, pain/ sensory transmission and convulsion (Harvey et al., 2004; Reinold et al., 2005; Eichler et al., 2008; Manzke et al., 2010). A recent report has suggested a potential role of the strychninesensitive glycine receptor (Komatsu et al., 2015) in the control of anxiety. In the present study, the intranasal taurine delivery increased the time to induce convulsion caused by strychnine, suggesting taurine may exert anti-anxiety action through the activation of strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors.
Recently, the intranasal delivery of peptide and protein draws much attention as it provides an alternative route of CNS drug delivery (Meredith et al., 2015). Intranasal peptides and proteins directly diffuse into the brain through the intercellular cleft in the olfactory epithelium as well as through the trigeminal nerve (Kozlovskaya et al., 2014; Lochhead and

Thorne, 2015). Interestingly, it has been found that there is indirect pathway for molecules to be transported in the brain via lymphatic or vasculature system and subsequently through blood brain barrier. We propose that the intranasally administered taurine could be transported to the brain via direct pathway(s) containing olfactory epithelium and/or trigeminal nerve. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that intranasally administered taurine may enter the brain lymphatic or vasculature system and subsequently pass through the blood brain barrier, exerting its anti-anxiety action. Since strychninesensitive glycine receptors are expressed hippocampus, brain stem, spinal cord, cerebellum and retina (Legendre et al., 2009; Yevenes and Zeilhofer, 2011), taurine transported via the intranasal pathway may interact with the strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors in the aforementioned brain regions and thereby inducing its CNS actions including anxiolytic activity. It has been found that the strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors are also expressed in adult rat amygdala (McCool and Botting, 2000) and taurine can activate these receptors (McCool and Chappell, 2007); this finding suggests that the intranasally delivered taurine could interact with the strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor to regulate anxiety in amygdala which plays important role in the regulation of emotion. It is also possible that taurine-induced anxiolytic behavior is mediated by dopamine regulation, considering that taurine elevates dopamine levels in nucleus accumbens (Ericson et al., 2006).
Taken together, it has been clearly demonstrated that taurine could be delivered to the brain system via intranasal route, inducing anti-anxiety action. These results suggest that intranasal administration could be an alternative route for the delivery of taurine into the brain to induce anti-anxiety action. Intranasal delivery of taurine could be considered in clinical situations requiring anxiety control. In conclusion, taurine exerts a significant anti-anxiety action via intranasal delivery, possibly due to its binding to and activating strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor in vivo. Future studies are necessary to compare the efficacy of intranasal administration of taurine with other administration routes.

An Adrenal Incidentaloma with Extramedullary Hematopoiesis Tyler Zachary, MD1, Lillian Lien, MD2. 1University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS, USA, 2UMMC, Ridgeland, MS, USA.
SAT-208 Introduction: Adrenal adenomas are incidentally noted during nonadrenal disease imaging at a rate up to 4%. Frequency of incidentalomas increases with age, most being adrenocortical adenomas. This case highlights an uncommon etiology of such an adrenal mass finding. Case Description: A 37-year-old with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and tobacco use was admitted after post-operative complication. Prior to surgery, she had been experiencing right upper quadrant pain along with 70 lb weight loss and diarrhea. She otherwise had frequent palpitations. Patient had undergone cholecystectomy and common hepatic duct injury was noted. Imaging revealed a 5.3 x 3.5 cm right adrenal mass previously unknown prior to surgery. Hormonal workup was negative for overproduction of aldosterone, cortisol, DHEA-S or metanephrines. Discussion: Patient underwent successful resection of adrenal mass, revealing adrenal adenoma with osseous metaplasia and hematopoiesis. Extramedullary hematopoiesis is a usually discovered incidentally as in this case. Typical sites are the spleen and liver. Cases of adrenal gland manifestations have been reported in the presence of hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis) or myelofibrosis. At four-month follow-up, laboratory testing on this patient didn't suggest any erythrocytic or leukocytic disorder. Conclusion: This case highlights an uncommon finding of hematopoiesis in an adrenal incidentaloma without any underlying hematologic defect or disease.

MON-902 Background: Intravenous etomidate infusion, in nonhypnotic doses, rapidly lowers cortisol levels by blocking 11-beta hydroxylation of deoxycortisol to inhibit cortisol production. It is an underutilized drug due to concerns of excess sedation and ICU monitoring. Clinical Case 1: A 44 year-old female with HTN, diabetes, and recently diagnosed pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with liver metastases presented with altered mentation. Labs showed severe hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, serum AM cortisol >60.2 ug/dL (n 6.7-22.6 ug/dL), ACTH of 698.1 pg/mL (n 7.263.3 pg/mL), 24-hour urine free cortisol (UFC) of 5791 ug/24hr (n 5-64 ug/24hr), midnight salivary cortisol of 8.04 ug/dL (n <0.01-0.09), and abnormal low dose (LDDST) and high dose (HDDST) dexamethasone suppression tests each with cortisol >60.2 ug/dL. She developed worsening psychosis, likely secondary to hypercortisolism. After ICU transfer, etomidate infusion was initiated at 2.5 mg/hr and titrated upward, leading to rapid drop in cortisol levels and concomitant improvement in mentation. No respiratory or airway difficulties developed. Ketoconazole and metyrapone were started and etomidate was weaned off. Steroids were added once cortisol levels fell below 10 ug/dL as part of "block and replace." The patient eventually underwent bilateral adrenalectomy with improvement in hemodynamic and blood glucose parameters. She was discharged on physiologic replacement doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, with no reported issues two months later. Clinical Case 2: A 51 year-old man with one month of hematochezia presented with hypertension, severe hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and QTc prolongation. Colonoscopy was unremarkable; however, labs revealed a cortisol of 43.1 ug/dL, ACTH of 83.6 pg/mL, and 24-hour UFC of 7,494 ug/L, with an abnormally elevated LDDST. Imaging showed a pancreatic mass and multiple hypodense liver lesions. The overall presentation was suggestive of ectopic ACTH syndrome due to metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma, which was confirmed on biopsy. Chemotherapy, ketoconazole, and metyrapone inadequately lowered cortisol. Etomidate drip was initiated at 3 mg/hr in the ICU, with rapid reduction in cortisol levels to <20 ug/dL without respiratory compromise. Attempts to wean off etomidate were unsuccessful and the patient underwent bilateral adrenalectomy. The surgery was compromised due to extensive liver and pancreatic enlargement, and follow up imaging revealed incomplete resection. 8am cortisol level (off etomidate) was >60.0 ug/dL. Metyrapone and ketoconazole were resumed and hydrocortisone was later initiated for "block and replace". The patient remains in critical condition. Conclusion: Etomidate-in non- hypnotic doses is useful for the rapid lowering of cortisol levels.

BACKGROUND Idiopathic dissecting cerebral aneurysms (IDCAs) are male dominant but are extremely rare in children. Many IDCAs in children are located in the posterior cerebral artery and the supraclinoid internal cervical artery. No cases of IDCA of the distal anterior cerebral artery (ACA) have been reported. OBSERVATIONS A previously healthy 7-month-old boy experienced afebrile seizures and presented at the authors' hospital 1 week after the first seizure. He was not feeling well but had no neurological deficits. The authors diagnosed a ruptured aneurysm of the right distal ACA based on imaging results. He underwent emergency craniotomy to prevent re-rupture of the aneurysm. Using intraoperative indocyanine green videoangiography, the authors confirmed peripheral blood flow and then performed aneurysmectomy. Pathological examination of the aneurysm revealed a thickened intima, fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina, and a hematoma in the aneurysmal wall. The authors ultimately diagnosed IDCA because no cause was indicated, including a history of trauma. The boy recovered after surgery and was subsequently discharged with no complications. LESSONS The authors reported, for the first time, IDCA of the distal ACA in an infant. The trapping technique is often used for giant fusiform aneurysms in infants. Indocyanine green videoangiography is useful for evaluating peripheral blood flow during trapping in this case.

KEYWORDS pediatric aneurysm; idiopathic dissecting cerebral aneurysm; distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysm

Pediatric cerebral aneurysms are rare, and there are even fewer reports of idiopathic dissecting cerebral aneurysms (IDCAs).1,2 No IDCA of the distal anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in infants has been reported previously. We performed aneurysmectomy for a ruptured aneurysm in an infant and diagnosed the lesion as an IDCA based on pathological examination. We report this case with a review of the literature.
Illustrative Case
History and Examination A previously healthy 7-month-old boy presented at our outpatient
pediatric clinic 1 week after exhibiting afebrile convulsions, which were clonic and lasted approximately 1 minute. He underwent observation as an outpatient. During his return visit 5 days later, he exhibited frequent vomiting and was therefore referred for further examination. The boy was born normally by vaginal delivery at 39 weeks. There was no history of

trauma or serious infection. He did not exhibit signs of liveliness, despite the absence of neurological deficits. The anterior fontanel was 20 ´ 25 mm without swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a 15-mm mass in the anterior longitudinal fissure (Fig. 1A and B). Overall, the lesion exhibited isointensity on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), although some parts exhibited high intensity on T1WI and low intensity on T2WI. The right frontal lobe, which was in contact with the lesion, was impaired. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated localized bleeding around the lesion. CT angiography indicated a 15-mm fusiform aneurysm in the right A3 segment (Fig. 1C). We theorized that the aneurysm rupture caused the acute symptomatic seizures. Emergency craniotomy was planned to prevent re-rupture of the aneurysm and allow pathological examination.
Treatment We performed aneurysmectomy of the right ACA by the inter-
hemispheric approach with the patient under general anesthesia. The

FIG. 1. T1WI (A), T2WI (B), and CT angiography (C) from the patient's first visit. A and B: A 15-mm mass is evident in the anterior longitudinal fissure. Overall, the lesion exhibits isointensity on T1WI and T2WI. Arrows indicate intramural hemorrhage, which exhibits high intensity on T1WI and low intensity on T2WI. C: A 15-mm fusiform aneurysm (asterisk) is visible in the A3 segment.
dural tension was slightly high. The aneurysm was confirmed by detaching it from between the right frontal lobe and the cerebral falx. A hematoma was located around the aneurysm. The entry and exit of the aneurysm were found by dissecting both ends of the aneurysm. First, the ACA on the proximal side was blocked with a clip (Fig. 2A and B). Indocyanine green videoangiography revealed retrograde blood flow in the distal ACA (Fig. 2C). Next, the ACA on the distal side was blocked with a clip, and the blood flow into the aneurysm was completely occluded. Finally, the aneurysm was resected after we dissected around the aneurysm.
Pathological Characteristics The aneurysm wall was composed of thinned adventitia and
thickened intima (Fig. 3A). On the whole, the wall was thin. The thickened intima was composed of fibroblasts and collagen fibers. The internal elastic lamina was fragmented, and a slight residue remained (Fig. 3B). Intramural hemorrhage was present, and the intima was similar to an intimal flap in some places (Fig. 3C). A hematoma was also present outside the aneurysm. The aneurysm wall in contact with the hematoma contained signs of neoangiogenesis and inflammatory cells, including neutrophils. No foam cells that would be characteristic of arteriosclerotic changes were present. Furthermore, no bacteria, fungi, or tumor cells were found.
Posttreatment Course The patient had no subsequent neurological deficits and regained
his vitality after the operation. CT angiography and MRI performed 13 days after surgery confirmed the disappearance of the aneurysm and demonstrated retrograde blood flow in the distal ACA (Fig. 4). The boy had no delayed cerebral ischemia and was discharged 14 days after surgery. He continued to take anticonvulsant agents for acute symptomatic seizures after surgery. We then carefully reduced the use of anticonvulsant agents because he was free from seizures after surgery. He was healthy 6 months after surgery.
Discussion
Observations Pediatric cerebral aneurysms occur rarely compared with aneu-
rysms in adults, accounting for <4% of all cerebral aneurysms.1 Furthermore, the incidence in infants younger than 1 year is extremely rare.3 Factors that contribute to pediatric cerebral aneurysm may include trauma, infection, moyamoya disease, arteriovenous malformation, fibromuscular dysplasia, sickle cell anemia, coarctation

of the aorta, polycystic renal disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, or the like.4 It has been reported that dissecting aneurysms after head trauma are the most common pediatric cerebral aneurysms, accounting for 10% to 39% of pediatric cerebral aneurysms.5-7 Dissecting aneurysms may occur with minor head trauma,8 and arterial injury is usually because of acceleration-deceleration between artery and cerebral falx or sphenoid ridge.7,9 In our patient, there was no apparent cause of the aneurysm (i.e., trauma, infection, congenital anomaly, etc.). CT angiography revealed that the aneurysm was located in the right A3 segment, and intraoperative findings showed that the aneurysm was adjacent to the cerebral falx. Therefore, we considered that arterial injury was not due to the acceleration-deceleration between artery and cerebral falx.
Dissecting aneurysms are classified into acute and chronic types, and their pathological findings are distinct. In acute dissection, the internal elastic lamina can be disrupted over a wide area, which leads to intramural hemorrhage. On the other hand, the aneurysm wall can be composed of a thickened intima and a thinned adventitia, and the fragmented internal elastic lamina remains slightly in chronic dissection. Infiltration of inflammatory cells such as macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils is observed on the aneurysm wall. In addition, the collagen fibers in the intima are disrupted in places, causing small dissociations.10 We evaluated our patient's aneurysm 1 week after the rupture and encountered pathological findings consistent with chronic dissection. In an experiment that observed the artery with disruption of the internal elastic lamina, it was confirmed that neoplasia of the intima starts to form approximately 1 week after rupture and is complete by approximately 3 months.11 This finding suggests that our case did not involve an acute dissection.
Dissecting cerebral aneurysms that have no obvious cause, such as trauma, are called IDCAs.4 IDCAs are usually found in the posterior circulation in adults,12,13 but pediatric cases have also been reported recently.2 Most cases involve boys (68%), and they show a predilection for the posterior cerebral artery, the supraclinoid internal carotid artery, and the middle cerebral artery.4 However, no IDCA of the distal ACA has been reported previously in infants. In our case, the patient was diagnosed as having an IDCA in the distal ACA on the basis of comprehensive evaluation of his medical history, imaging findings, and pathological examination.

time, and most of them have a fatal outcome.14 Our case involved a ruptured aneurysm with high intensity on T1WI. Early treatment is considered necessary when a hematoma in the aneurysm wall is visualized by MRI.
Internal trapping is an optional treatment for giant fusiform aneurysms in children.4 Trapping is a concern with respect to peripheral ischemic complications. A balloon occlusion test can check ischemia

tolerance, but placement of the test occlusion balloon beyond the circle of Willis in infants presents a high risk.7 If bypass surgery is attempted in infants, it is difficult to perform vascular anastomosis because of the small diameter of the peripheral artery. Children can tolerate trapping better than adults because of their greater brain plasticity and better compensatory blood supply.15,16 Even if symptoms such as paralysis occur after surgery, those symptoms may improve in the long term.7 Our case involved a giant fusiform aneurysm of the right ACA in an infant; therefore, we considered trapping to be an optimal technique. Intraoperative indocyanine green videoangiography was performed to assess peripheral blood flow after trapping. We confirmed retrograde blood flow in the peripheral blood vessels in real time with indocyanine green videoangiography, whereas entry into the aneurysm was blocked. Therefore, we predicted that peripheral blood flow would be maintained even if trapped. In fact, no neurological deficits, such as paralysis of the left lower extremity, occurred after the surgery. One problem with this method is that peripheral blood flow cannot be quantified. A specific tool (FLOW 800, Carl Zeiss) can generate blood flow dynamics data by identifying detailed vessel blood flow intraoperatively.17 Although this tool has not been used in our hospital, it may be useful for quantifying peripheral blood flow.
Lessons We report an IDCA of the distal ACA in an infant. Trapping is a
good treatment approach for giant fusiform aneurysms in infants.

Abstract We present a rare extramedullary, bifocal, and hyposecretory manifestation of relapsed MM that could be mistaken for an infection. We stress the importance of complex evaluation including serum, urine, and bone marrow assessment and whole-­body imaging.
KEYWORDS extramedullary, hyposecretory, imaging, multiple myeloma

1. What is the new aspect of your work? A very rare manifestation of multiple myeloma relapse, being all extramedullary, bifocal, and hyposecretory. Moreover, the activity of the disease did not behave as myeloma but rather as a different (infectious) condition.
2. What is the central finding of your work? We stress the importance of comprehensive examination including modern diagnostic tools to elucidate the diagnosis that goes behind routine criteria.
3. What is (or could be) the specific clinical relevance of your work? The key clinical points are following: Multiple myeloma manifestation can be really atypical and can be mistaken for a different condition. The approach to suspected relapse of multiple myeloma should not rely solely on routine monitoring but it should include complex

assessment including serum and urine tests, bone marrow assessment, and whole-b­ ody imaging. Extramedullary myeloma needs to be looked for using appropriate imaging techniques.
1 |INTRODUCTION
With prolonged survival of multiple myeloma (MM) patients due to the introduction of novel drugs, we encounter uncommon manifestations of the relapses. As the disease evolves, it becomes more aggressive, including secondary plasma cell leukemia, extramedullary plasmocytoma (EM), or central nervous system involvement. The latter relapses are often with lower M-p­rotein, some patients might have

2 | CASE REPORT
A 69-y­ ear-­old man was diagnosed with MM based on usual complaints (lower back pain with lytic bone involvement of the spine). The initial diagnosis was IgA kappa MM, stage IIIA (Durie-­Salmon), ISS 2 (International Staging System), with hyperdiploidy (trisomy of chromosome 15) and t(4;14). The patient characteristics and therapy outcomes are in Table 1. Due to co-­morbidities, he was transplant ineligible and started induction treatment with VMP regimen (bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone). After 9 cycles, he reached partial remission (PR) with stable levels of M-­protein (12 g/L) and was followed without therapy. 16 months after the diagnosis, he relapsed and started therapy with IRD regimen (ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone). The therapy induced complete response.
Two years later, we noticed slight elevation of involved free light chain (FLC) kappa (up to 72.58 mg/L without clear dynamics, K/L up to 9.03) with inconstant presence of positive immunofixation, without measurable M-p­ rotein (Table 2). The patient was asymptomatic; therefore, we continued IRD treatment with careful observation as the results did not fulfill the IMWG (International Myeloma Working Group) criteria for progression.1
Four months later, the patient had oral complaints (difficulty in biting) with a lesion on the upper left gum. As the

Description: Paranasal sinuses are physiological except of left maxillary sinus. Significant tumorous infiltration of the skeletal wall of the left maxillary sinus, with a character of permeative osteolysis and destruction continuing to the alveolar part of the jaw. The cavity is completely filled with pathological content. Soft tissue masses cross the wall of the sinus to the infratemporal cavity and infiltrate fat tissue as well as pterygoid muscles. The infiltration continues through the alveolar protrusion into the hard palate and mouth cavity--­locally infiltrating both buccal region and left part of the nasal cavity. The overall size is 55x50x35mm. In the center of maxillary cavity, there are smooth calcifications that might correspond to mycotic infection. The PET/CT scans show significant activity (standardized uptake value--­SUV 36)

oral mucosa showed a presence of mucor, and laboratory testing revealed elevation of C-r­ eactive protein (122.1 mg/L). The lesion was enlarged and painful (Figure 1A). Therefore, the patient was hospitalized with initiation of intravenous antimycotic therapy (amphotericin B lipid complex).
We performed CT scan that described a destruction of bone structures of the left maxillary sinus with soft tissue infitration (Figure 2). The finding was suspicious of MM relapse with possible mycotic involvement in the center of the cavity. However, myeloma-­specific parameters were as follows: M-­protein 0 g/L with negative immunofixation, FLC

kappa 35.6 mg/L, lambda 11.28 mg/L, K/L 3.16, urine immunofixation negative (Table 2). Bone marrow aspiration did not find any clonal plasma cells.
Therefore, surgery was performed that removed most of the pathological masses. Histology of the bioptical sample confirmed infiltration by myeloma cells (Figure 3). Neither histology nor microbiology found fungal involvement. The reason might be due to only accidental finding or possibly due to initial course of anti-f­ungal therapy. There were no other signs of invasive mycosis, including repeatedly negative fungal cultures and galactomannan

At present (18 months later), the patient is in remission with negative immunofixation and normal levels of FLC. The focal lesion of the left maxillary alveolus resolved completely (Figure 1B,C). Control PET/CT 6 months later confirmed complete regression of the lesion behind the left kidney, and significant regression of the lesion in the left maxillary sinus (SUV decrease: 36-­ 2.2).

3 |DISCUSSION
Our paper shows an example of a phenotypic clonal evolution of MM that presented as a complex of rare manifestations of the disease. At relapse, the disease became oligosecretory, extramedullary, and bifocal. Moreover, the manifestation was overshadowed by infectious symptoms with suspicion on invasive mycotic involvement.
The incidence of all these manifestations in one patient is uncommon. Up to 10% of MM patients undergo "light chain escape." In most of them, the absolute increase of involved FLC is >100 mg/L, which is the recommended level for defining a relapse that requires treatment.2 Only a few patients (1%-­5%) are oligosecretory with very low levels of FLC or even non-­secretory. Most of such patients, however, have significant bone marrow involvement by clonal plasma cells.
EM is a unique entity occurring in 6%-2­ 0% of patients in the course of MM.3 Both primary (at the time of MM diagnosis) and secondary EM (at MM relapse) can occur as bone-­related or soft tissue-­related usually in parenchymal organs or skin. With the introduction of more sensitive imaging methods (CT, magnetic resonance, PET/CT), the evidence of extramedullary involvement has become more frequent. Also, prolonged survival of MM patients due to novel drugs (such as immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies) has led to higher frequency of rare manifestations. There is, however, no direct connection between the therapy of any of these drugs and evolution of EM. Patients with EM are reckoned to be "high-­risk" with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic response to both conventional chemotherapy as well as novel agents. Similar approaches as in the high-­risk MM are recommended, with radiotherapy to improve disease control.4
Approximately 3%-­5% of MM have bone marrow plasma cell infiltration 10%. The reason might be due to inadequate tissue sampling, only a few of these are multiple plasmocytomas or lesions without generalized bone marrow

involvement. For such patients, repeated examination is needed or an image-g­ uided biopsy of a bony or extramedullary lesion.5
We underline the importance of whole-­body imaging. In our case, it revealed two distinct active EM despite no direct signs of systemic MM relapse. The diagnostics were quite fast due to the signs of MM instability (alternating positivity of immunofixation and slight elevation of iFLC). Nevertheless, the definitive diagnosis of relapse relied on histological verification of the extramedullary mass rather than on IMWG criteria. On the other hand, continuous measurement of FLC (despite low levels) was a contributive auxiliary tool for the disease assessment (Table 2).
We conclude that the biology and behavior of MM can be very heterogeneous. With the introduction of novel drugs, the patients live longer and may relapse with more uncommon manifestations. IMWG criteria should be always used as the gold standard but the biology may go beyond the criteria. Both clinical experience and routine examination are needed to set up a correct diagnostic approach. Modern diagnostic tools including imaging techniques as well as laboratory assessment are helpful and should be used appropriately also in patients with advanced disease.

Introduction: Gastric cancer is a worldwide health concern, being one of the five most common malignant neoplasms worldwide. Currently, an open approach is the gold standard for surgical treatment. Incorporation of laparoscopy as a method of choice for gastric resections remains controversial because of limited evidence of eligibility. To date, there are no high-quality randomized quality trials on totally laparoscopic D2 total gastrectomies. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess currently available literature and provide metaanalysis on acquired data regarding short-term outcomes with a subgroup analysis of western and eastern studies. Materials and methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the PRISMA guidelines. The primary outcomes of interest were morbidity and short-term complications. Results: An initial reference search yielded 3,073 articles. Finally, we chose eight studies covering 1,582 patients that we included in the quantitative analysis. We did not find statistical differences regarding operative time, anastomotic leakage, surgical site infection, cardiac complications, pulmonary complications, or number of harvested lymph nodes. We found significant differences regarding length of hospital stay and morbidity in the Asian population. Conclusion: This systematic review indicates that a laparoscopic approach for D2 total gastrectomy does not increase morbidity. Furthermore, it allows for a shorter hospital stay. However, more randomized controlled trials are required to fully assess this approach because available data are of limited quality. Keywords: systematic review, meta-analysis, total gastrectomy, laparoscopy

Introduction
Gastric cancer is one of the five most common malignant neoplasms worldwide, making it a worldwide health concern.1 Radical resection with adequate lymphadenectomy is required to provide the best oncological response.2 Currently, an open approach is the gold standard. However, minimally invasive approaches such as laparoscopy, laparoscopic-assisted and robotic procedures have been introduced with success in oncological surgery of the stomach.3 Even though the first laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer by Kitano was performed in 1993, incorporation of laparoscopy as a method of choice for gastric resections remains controversial because of limited evidence of eligibility. To date, no high-quality randomized quality trials regarding totally laparoscopic D2 total gastrectomies (TLDGs) have been conducted. Moreover,

most of the observational studies that are available focus on the Asian population, which is of great importance because there are as yet unexplained differences in many aspects of this disease and its treatment compared with western populations.4-6 Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are currently underway, but results are not expected until the next few years and the majority of them are being conducted in Asian countries.7,8 Our study aimed to assess currently available literature in this matter and provide meta-analysis on acquired data regarding short-term outcomes with a subgroup analysis of western and eastern studies.

number of operated subjects, sex, age, tumor size, tumor stage, and outcomes of interest.
Non-randomized studies were evaluated according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), which consists of three factors: patient selection, comparability of study groups, and assessment of outcomes. A score of 0-9 was assigned to each study, and studies achieving a score of 6 or higher were considered high quality. This study was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines and the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) consensus statement.9,10

Methods Study selection
A systematic review of the literature was performed using the Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases to identify all eligible studies that compared patients undergoing TLDG with patients undergoing open D2 gastrectomy (ODG). The search terms were: "laparoscopy," "minimally invasive," "classic," "open," and "gastrectomy." These terms were combined using the Boolean operators "AND" and "OR." The most recent search was performed on November 6, 2017.
Studies eligible for further analysis had to fulfill the following criteria: 1) comparison of patients undergoing TLDG versus ODG; 2) D2 lymphadenectomy; 3) publication in English. Studies were excluded when there was: 1) lack of comparative data; 2) insufficient data to analyze; 3) type of lymphadenectomy unknown 4) laparoscopy-assisted procedures or robotic procedures.
Outcomes of interest
Primary outcomes of interest involved perioperative parameters such as operative time, morbidity (described as the overall complication rate reported by the authors), anastomotic leakage, surgical site infections, cardiopulmonary complications, and length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes involved oncological effect: the R0 resection rate and lymph node yield.
Data extraction and quality assessment
All references were reviewed and evaluated by two teams of two researchers. In case of any doubts about eligibility for inclusion, an attempt was made to reach consensus within the group. If no resolution was possible, an arbitrary decision was made by another reviewer. Data from the included studies were extracted independently by all teams. Only full-length articles were eligible for extraction. When available, the following data were extracted: first author, year of publication,

Data analysis
Analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 (freeware from the Cochrane Collaboration). Statistical heterogeneity and inconsistency were measured using Cochran's Q tests and I2, respectively. Qualitative outcomes from individual studies were analyzed to assess individual and pooled risk ratios (RR) with pertinent 95% CI favoring patients undergoing revisionary surgery and by means of the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects method. When appropriate, mean and SD were calculated from medians and interquartile ranges using a method proposed by Hozo et al.11 Weighted mean differences (WMDs) with a 95% CI are presented for quantitative variables using the inverse variance random-effects method. Statistical significance was observed with a two-tailed 0.05 level for hypotheses, and with 0.10 for heterogeneity testing, while unadjusted P-values were reported accordingly. Additionally, we introduced subgroups, dividing studies based on the nationality of the analyzed population to eastern and western groups.
Results
The initial reference search yielded 3,073 articles. After removing 1,513 duplicates, 1,250 articles had their titles and abstracts evaluated. This resulted in 140 papers suitable for full-text review. Finally, we chose eight studies that were included in the quantitative analysis, which covered 1,582 patients (755 in the TLDG group and 827 in the ODG group). A flowchart of the analyzed studies is presented in Figure 1. The quality of the analyzed studies is moderate, with the majority scoring at least 7 points according to the NOS. Baseline information about the analyzed studies is presented in Table 1 and Figure 2. There were more patients with advanced tumors in open approach in comparison to the laparoscopic group. According to this division, three studies were based on a western population and five studies were based on an Asian population.

laparoscopy, whereas Wu et al,17 Lu et al,18 and Shu et al19 reported the opposite. The heterogeneity was very high, I2=99%. Sensitivity analysis revealed three studies generating all heterogeneity - Kim et al,14 Lu et al,17 and Ramagen et al.16 After removing those studies, open surgeries were shorter by an average of 50 minutes.
Morbidity was reported in seven studies. Only one study by Kim et al presented data in favor of laparoscopy. After pooling data, meta-analysis revealed significant differences between TLDG (105/708, 14.83%) and ODG (167/763, 21.89%), RR: 0.67; 95% CI [0.51, 0.86]; P=0.002 (Figure 4). Subgroup analysis showed significant differences in the Asian population, RR: 0.63; 95% CI [0.47, 0.85]. A similar analysis of the western population did not show significant differences; however, the sample size was small. The heterogeneity was low, I2=17%.
Anastomotic leakage was reported in seven studies. There were no statistically significant differences either in total or within subgroups, RR: 0.67; 95% CI [0.36, 1.28]; P=0.23 (Figure 5). The heterogeneity was low.
Surgical site infection was reported by four authors. There were no significant differences in the Asian group, RR: 0.44; 95% CI [0.15, 1.3]; P=0.14. There was only one study in the western group and it also did not report a significant difference. The heterogeneity was low and after pooling subgroups, the result remained statistically insignificant (Figure 6).
Cardiac complications were reported only by two authors, whereas pulmonary complications were reported in five studies. There were no differences in cardiac complications between analyzed groups, RR: 0.6; 95% CI [0.13, 2.81]; P=0.52 (Figure 7). Analysis of pulmonary complications resulted in similar conclusions, RR: 0.68; 95% CI [0.41, 1.14]; P=0.14 (Figure 8). In both outcomes, the heterogeneity of included studies was low, I2=0%.
Length of hospital stay was reported in seven studies. The analysis revealed laparoscopy was associated with a

Discussion
This systematic review, based on 1,582 patients, showed that a laparoscopic approach for total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy is associated with significantly lower morbidity and shorter length of stay (LOS) with no negative impact on

­short-term oncological outcomes. All of the included studies were observational; thus, the available data quality is limited. Compared with previous systematic reviews, our study incorporated a subgroup distinction for western and eastern populations.5,20,21 Another major difference in favor of this systematic review was the inclusion of totally laparoscopic total gastrectomies only. It is important because prior meta-analyses incorporated studies involving laparoscopic-assisted procedures or partial gastrectomy.5 This could possibly introduce bias because totally laparoscopic procedures with intracorporeal anastomoses are considered technically more demanding.22,23

Laparoscopy is gradually gaining support in oncological surgery. Its efficacy has been proven best in colorectal surgery in numerous high-quality RCTs and systematic reviews that followed.24-26 As for other neoplasms such as gastric cancer, we can currently rely only on data from observational studies, which in general show that the novel approach has been as good as the classic approach, and in some studies the novel approach provided better results. The only available RCTs regarding gastric cancer were focused on distal gastrectomies.27-29 RCTs regarding laparoscopic versus

open gastrectomy for gastric cancer are ongoing in Japan (JCOG1401), China (CLASS02-01), Korea (KLASS03), and the Netherlands (STOMACH).
An important factor determining the difficulty of surgery and, as a result, the potential safety of the technique is the duration of the procedure. In our study, operative time at first did not differ in total between both approaches. However, the heterogeneity was very high. Authors' reports varied from shorter times for laparoscopy, no difference in duration between the two procedures, or a shorter time in the

open approach. After identifying three studies generating the majority of the heterogeneity, (Kim et al, Ramagen, and Lu), we decided to analyze the material without them. This decision resulted in shorter operative time by 50 minutes in favor of open surgery. On one hand, laparoscopy is associated with shorter time spent for proper abdomen closure. On the other, it is more technically demanding. Another possible explanation is the learning curve. Most of the studies did not point out whether surgeons were still on the learning curve or how far beyond it they had gone. The next probable explanation is lack of information about how some authors defined operative time. That is, is it from opening to the closure of the abdomen or beginning of general anesthesia? Although operative time can be considered a reliable benchmark in assessing the operative technique, it would seem that the clinical relevance of this outcome is limited. One could say that it is safer to take a longer time to operate and reduce the chance of overlooking any avoidable complications. In our study, a longer operative time did not increase overall morbidity. On the contrary, morbidity in our study was lower in the laparoscopic group. This is important because the number of complications is another factor of surgery safety. It is interesting that in the subgroup of the western population, the difference was not present. The range of lymphadenectomy may also cause discrepancies in morbidity rate. Another factor underlining this assumption is the lack of significant differences in the rate of anastomotic leakages. That there was no heterogeneity between the western and Asian populations suggests also that, even though laparoscopic esophagoenterostomy is technically demanding and requires meticulous performance, the success rate of proper anastomoses is similar. Another

factor that can affect the results is the nutritional status. None of the authors provided this information, which affects both short- and long-term results after gastrectomy.30,31 Finally, the experience of the laparoscopic surgeon is also an important factor to consider in regard to morbidity because gastrectomy is one of the most difficult surgeries; it involves the abdomen and sometimes the chest cavity. All of the above are among the many elements affecting the length of hospital stay. Our meta-analysis showed significantly shorter LOS for the laparoscopic approach, which is in line with the contributions of the laparoscopic approach in different surgical fields.32 However, an unbiased comparison of LOS between countries and hospitals is difficult because it is more associated with local customs than fulfilling clear objective discharge criteria.
The debate on the oncological advantages of various surgical and non-surgical approaches for gastric cancer persists. Currently a preferred surgical method of treatment is gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. In our study the R0 rate did not differ among the authors with a lack of heterogeneity. Adequate lymphadenectomy during surgery is a crucial part of patient survival. Available meta-analysis of D2 versus D1 lymphadenectomy by Seevaratnam et al and Mocellin et al shows greater mortality and morbidity in D2 resections; however, subgroup analysis showed that this does not occur in more up-to-date studies.33,34 Furthermore, long-term survival reported by El-Sedfy showed better results for patients with T3 cancers.35 While initial experiences with D3 lymphadenectomy showed promise, later RCTs and meta-analysis showed no additional benefit from extensive excision.36,37 In our study, we decided to include studies with D2 lymphadenectomy only.

was associated with high heterogeneity. Most likely it was caused by different techniques and lack of standardization of lymphadenectomy. De Steur et al, in their study, showed that over 80% of patients did not receive proper lymph station excision.38 No differences in the R0 rate along with indifferent lymph node may show lack of oncological inferiority of laparoscopic approach to open; however, its true oncological value is yet to be determined with long-term survival rates. Chen et al, in their meta-analysis regarding minimally invasive gastrectomies, showed no difference in 5-year overall survival; however extrapolating this to totally laparoscopic gastrectomies may be prone to bias because the subgroup analysis included only two studies.39 This is why the results of ongoing RCTs are so anticipated. None of the studies included in our review provided information on long-term survival, and from an oncological point of view, long-term survival is one of the most important outcomes.
Limitations
The main limitation of this study is the lack of randomized control studies. While most of the studies were of rather high quality, drawing valid conclusions may be prone to bias. The open approach group had more patients with more advanced cancer (stages III and IV), which could be associated with selection, and therefore potentially affect results. Furthermore, none of the analyzed studies provided information on the experience of the surgeons, which could drastically change results. Additionally, none of the papers provided meticulous information on the perioperative care protocol used in every unit. This is important because studies show how novel enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols may improve short-term outcomes40-43 The main advantage of our study was the introduction of subgroups for western and Asian populations. It shows that, while we are getting sufficient data regarding the eastern population, the information we have on western countries is scarce. Although we await the results of the STOMACH trial in the Netherlands, it is possible that the number of RCTs in Europe and the US may not increase because patients prefer minimally invasive surgery, which makes them reluctant to enroll in ongoing trials comparing an open approach with laparoscopic surgery.44 Furthermore, the prevalence of gastric cancer in Europe is lower than in Asia, which results in a lower annual number of gastrectomies. For this reason, to achieve sufficient patient numbers, multicenter studies are required. On one hand, it is good because we need to have data on the European population as well. On the other hand, this may cause bias associated with surgical technique. ­Nevertheless, to provide sufficient answers backed with high-quality data, we need RCTs.

Conclusion
This systematic review indicated that a laparoscopic approach for D2 total gastrectomy does not increase morbidity in comparison to an open approach. Furthermore, a laparoscopic approach allows for a shorter hospital stay. However, more RCTs are required to fully assess this approach because the available data are of limited quality.

Abstract
A 47-year-old woman underwent prophylactic subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) 18 years ago. She underwent 5 transanal endoscopic microsurgeries for rectal remnant polyps, and was referred for the treatment of rectal remnant polyp recurrence. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was performed to remove multiple polypoid lesions that circumferentially extended throughout the rectal remnant with lesions spreading onto the anastomotic site. The rectal remnant mucosa was resected in 2 pieces without complication. Specimens showed high-grade adenoma but no malignancy. Follow-up colonoscopy showed no recurrence.

Introduction
Subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) is occasionally performed for patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) rather than total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA), because it produces better functional outcomes and decreases the infertility rate after surgery.1,2 However, neoplasms that occur in the rectal remnant after IRA require additional treatments, including secondary proctectomy.3 Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has recently been performed to treat superficial neoplasms of the digestive tract.4-8
Case Report
A 47-year-old woman underwent prophylactic subtotal colectomy with IRA for FAP 18 years ago. She then underwent 5 separate transanal endoscopic microsurgeries (TEMs) for the removal of subsequent rectal remnant polyps. Proctoscopy revealed multiple polypoid lesions in the rectal remnant (Figure 1). Biopsy specimens from the polypoid lesions showed high-grade adenoma. Because the polyps circumferentially extended throughout the rectal remnant with the oral portion of the lesions spreading onto the anastomotic site, circumferential ESD was planned for the complete resection of the rectal remnant mucosa.
Although the submucosal dissection at the anastomotic site was difficult because of severe fibrosis, the rectal remnant mucosa was completely resected in 2 pieces without perforation using a KD-620LR hook knife (Olympus Medical Systems, Center Valley, PA; Figure 2).6 Pathology examination of the resected specimens demonstrated high-grade, non-cancerous adenoma. Post-ESD stricture was prevented using a betamethasone suppository and finger bougie. Follow-up proctoscopy performed 12 months after the circumferential ESD showed no recurrence in the rectal remnant (Figure 3). Rectal mucosa was completely replaced by ileal mucosa and the bowel function of the patient was not exacerbated.

ESD for Complete Resection of Rectal Remnant Mucosa

Discussion
FAP is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by more than hundreds of adenomatous polyps. FAP increases the risk of colon cancer, and prophylactic colectomy is required to prevent the further development of colon cancer. Colectomy can be either subtotal colectomy with IRA or total proctocolectomy with IPAA. Total proctocolectomy with IPAA is more difficult to perform, and can result in impaired bowel function and an increased risk of infertility. Thus, subtotal colectomy with IRA is preferred, especially in younger patients.1,2 However, neoplasms can occur in the rectal remnant after IRA, requiring additional endoscopic treatments and/or secondary proctectomy.3

Figure 3. Follow-up proctoscopy 12 months after ESD showed rectal mucosa was completely replaced by ileal mucosa and no recurrence in the rectal remnant.
motic and post-TEM sites, use of a hook knife enabled precise submucosal dissection of the fibrotic tissues and completion of circumferential ESD without perforation. Stricture following circumferential ESD can be managed with steroid suppositories and finger bougies. We suggest that circumferential ESD is a safe and effective treatment for complete resection of the rectal remnant mucosa after IRA in patients with FAP.
Disclosures
Author contributions: The authors contributed equally to the creation of this manuscript. N. Ishii is the article guarantor.

In cases such as ours, where many polyps spread onto the anastomotic site and throughout the rectal remnant, treatment by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) using snare is difficult. Because ESD has been performed for the resection of large gastrointestinal neoplasms with negligible risk of metastasis,3-8 we decided to perform circumferential ESD for the resection of the rectal remnant mucosa. Although severe fibrosis was observed within the submucosal layer at the anasto-

COLIN CLOUT'S CALENDAR.

[FEB.

Colin Clout's Calendar.

By Grant Allen.
Windus: 1883.

London : Chatto &

Under this quaint title, we find another volume of sketches by Mr Grant Allen, similar in nature to the light, breezy papers by which he has made his name familiar to magazine readers. The Calendar is " the record of a summer, from April to October," as the title has it; and although our author certainly, by his own showing, trenches deeply on the autumn time, no one will grudge him the extension of his season. The papers included in this volume originally appeared in the St James's Gazette. Mr Allen chats pleasantly aboutu Wild Hyacinths," "Catkins and Almond Blossom," " Spring Flowers," " The Mole at Home," and other kindred subjects. He is always lively, and for the most part clear and entertaining. If there is any fault to be found with this, as with his other works, it is that they are somewhat sketchy, and leave the reader, often unqualified as he is, to fill in the pictures whose outlines Mr Allen draws. But if they stimulate a love of nature and of inquiry, as we think they do, such works show yeoman service in the cause of knowledge and its diffusion. For a leisure hour, there cannot be a better companion than Colin Clout's Calendar.

Case report
Fade to black!

A 71-year-old man presented to the emergency room with chest pain, dry cough, shortness of breath and night sweats for 10days. He had no fever, flu-like symptoms, sputum production or haemoptysis. There was no history of recent travel or sick contacts. A general review of systems was remarkable for subjective weight loss and malaise. He was an active smoker with a 100pack-years smoking history and a past medical history of rectal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). His cancer was treated with chemoradiotherapy and had been in remission for 8years before the presentation. He was also known to have COPD, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) category B, well-controlled, with no recent hospitalisations or exacerbations over the past year.
Upon initial examination, arterial blood pressure was 123/75mmHg, heart rate was 81beats per min, respiratory rate was 24breaths per min, and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. Arterial blood gases showed partial oxygen pressure 73mmHg, carbon dioxide tension 45mmHg and pH 7.43. There were decreased breath sounds on the right side, up to the upper lung zone with dull percussion note and reduced tactile vocal fremitus on chest examination. The physical examination was unremarkable otherwise. The patient had a chest radiograph, which showed a right-sided pleural effusion (figure 1).

Answer 1 b.

Answer 2 a.

The most likely diagnosis is malignant pleural effusion due to significant smoking history and prior history of malignancy. CAP and pulmonary TB are differentials. The patient received intravenous antibiotics for possible CAP.
Task 2 What is the most appropriate investigation to undertake next?
a) Thoracentesis b) Order a computed tomography (CT) scan c) Perform bronchoscopy d) Quantiferon Gold for TB

A diagnostic thoracentesis is needed to establish appropriate diagnosis. Under ultrasound guidance, a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis yielded 1200mL of fluid. Shortness of breath and tachypnoea improved post-procedure.
The fluid analysis results showed straw-coloured lymphocytic, exudative effusion, a negative Gram stain, and malignant cells, consistent with malignant pleural effusion (table 1). The pleural fluid analysis was not suggestive of complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema.
On day 2 of admission, the patient developed worsening shortness of breath and desaturation. A follow-up examination revealed tracheal deviation to the left side, with decreased vocal fremitus and reduced breath sounds on the right side.

Figure 2Chest radiograph depicting right-sided pneumothorax.
Answer 3 d.
A repeat chest radiograph revealed iatrogenic pneumothorax on the side of the pleural effusion (figure 2).
Task 4 What should be the next step in the management of the patient?
a) Oxygen supplementation and observation b) Needle aspiration c) Chest tube insertion d) High-flow nasal oxygen

Figure 3 Chest radiograph showing a right-sided chest tube and partial lung re-expansion.
Answer 4 c.
The patient has a >2cm iatrogenic pneumothorax and is symptomatic. Hence a chest tube was inserted and connected to the underwater seal (figure 3).
The patient's shortness of breath progressed despite chest tube insertion. The chest tube was functioning appropriately, as evidenced by swinging fluid levels and bubbling. CT of the chest was performed (figure 4).
Task 5 Can you identify the finding on the chest CT image (figure 4)?
a) Pneumothorax b) Apical bleb c) Sub-pleural nodules d) All of the above

Figure 4 Chest CT.

Breathe |December 2020|Volume 16|No 4 3

Answer 5 d.

Answer 6 c.

The right lung shows a sizeable pneumothorax, apical subpleural blebs and subpleural nodules. Other cuts of CT revealed multiple spiculated nodules throughout both lung fields.
Task 6 Considering the persistent air-leak, what is the most appropriate next step in management?
a) Perform bronchoscopy b) Pleurodesis c) Thoracoscopy d) Bilateral chest tube insertion

The patient underwent right-sided videoassisted thoracoscopy. There was an upper lobe scar with surrounding nodules and continuous air leak. The thoracic surgery team performed an upper lobe wedge resection to fix the air leak and inserted a chest tube connected to an underwater seal. The colour of the fluid draining from the chest tube noted immediately post chest tube insertion was black (figure 5).
Task 7 What is the most common cause of this finding?
a) Crack cocaine use b) Malignancy c) Fungal infection d) Pancreatic pseudocyst rupture with
pancreaticoplural fistula

Answer 7 b.
The most common cause of the black pleural effusion is malignancy. The pleural fluid analysis was consistent with empyema secondary to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae (table 1). Multiple invasive procedures, including a thoracocentesis and chest tube insertion performed before thoracoscopy on a frail, elderly patient with underlying malignancy, could have led to an iatrogenic empyema. Pyomelanin is a brown/black extracellular pigment produced by Pseudomonas; however, it does not cause black discolouration of body fluids.
The patient also had neutrophilic leukocytosis, a raised C-reative protein (324mg·L-1), and high procalcitonin (38.2ng·mL-1). He received piperacillin/tazobactam with a working diagnosis of empyema. Over the next 8weeks, 8L of pleural fluid was drained. Although the pleural fluid haematocrit was not measured, there was no drop in haemoglobin with massive fluid removal. Moreover, the fluid was free-flowing without any clots. The persisting dark colour of the fluid despite a decrease in RBC content over time without a haemoglobin drop indicates the absence

of haemodynamically significant bleeding. The possibility of the black colour being secondary to haemolysis cannot be excluded entirely; however, the fact that the fluid colour turned to black immediately post-thoracoscopy without an initial red colour, which is more typical of a haemothorax, makes acute bleeding less likely as a cause. The other possibility is of bilothorax, which is usually reported secondary to a pancreaticopleural fistula. The absence of ascites and right-sided effusion makes that less likely.
Reported causes of black pleural fluid associated with malignancy are either due to pigment production by malignant cells (e.g. melanoma) or haemolysis. The black pleural effusion associated with most adenocarcinoma cases has been attributed to haemolysis. The authors believe that the absence of black colour from the initial pleural fluid sample, and then the appearance of this colour post-thoracoscopy, may be suggestive of the colour being attributed to the surgical intervention. However, to the best of our knowledge, such an association is not reported in the literature.
The surgical pathology report from the wedge resection showed infiltration of the lung by poorly differentiated malignant cells forming solid sheets. The tumour cells were pleomorphic with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, along with frequent mitotic

Based on negative lung adenocarcinoma markers, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and napsin-A, a lung primary was less likely. TTF-1 immunoreactivity is highly sensitive and specific in determining pulmonary versus extrapulmonary origin of adenocarcinoma [1]. In extrapulmonary adenocarcinomas (except thyroid) is so low (1%) that the negativity for TTF-1 may be interpreted as definitive evidence that the tumour is a primary from an extrapulmonary source. The cells were immunopositive for cytokeratin (CK)-7 expression and immunonegative for CK-20 expression (figure 6). A definitive conclusion on the origin of the tumour based entirely on the immunostaining is challenging due to the lack of additional markers of pancreatic and hepatobiliary origin.
CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed a dilated common bile duct measuring 16mm with associated dilated intrahepatic biliary radicals. CK-7 positivity and

CK-20 negativity in biliary tract carcinomas are associated with intrahepatic bile duct carcinomas. Tumour markers showed normal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), but a raised carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) (table 2). The serum alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase were also elevated. The patient's age, sex, tumour marker profile, immunohistochemical profile, liver function profile, and imaging data fit the possibility of metastasis from a hepatobiliary origin, likely intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma [2-5].
A multidisciplinary team meeting between the primary team, pulmonology, cardiothoracic surgery, oncology, onco-radiology and histopathology was conducted. The general condition of the patient made him unfit for further malignancy workup or chemotherapy. He received palliative care from thereon. He later passed away due to the progression of the disease.

autoimmunity to drugs of abuse [6, 7]. Analysis of pleural fluid is essential to the diagnosis of underlying aetiology. The pleural fluid colour may vary from clear or straw-coloured to blood-tinged or frankly bloody [8]. It is incredibly unusual to have black coloured pleural effusion. The authors reviewed the literature on Medline, PubMed, Embase and Google scholar. Key terms used were ("black" and (("pleura" or pleural")) and "effusion").

The search duration was from 1950 to June 26, 2020. The search identified 25 reported cases of black pleural effusion (table 3).
There are 11 reported cases of black pleural fluid secondary to malignancy. What makes this case unique is the immunostaining being negative for lung markers and melanoma. Hence, it is the first reported black pleural effusion case thought to be secondary to hepatobiliary malignancy.

Background/aims In patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a critical organ failure complication that resulted in rapid mortality. There are no efficient parameters to predict HRS in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related ACLF. To assess HBV-ACLF risk factors and evaluate the association between mean arterial pressures (MAP), HRS and survival in patients with HBV-ACLF. Methods A total of 420 ACLF patients were screened from June 2015 to June 2016, and 57 HBV-ACLF patients were included in the study. Clinical data and MAP measurements of these patients were collected. Multivariate analyses, Cox proportional hazards regression and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyze. Results In a 30-day study period, 43 (75.44%) patients survived. Patients in the HRS group were older and had higher Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores than patients in the non-HRS group. A MAP drop of 9.5 mmHg was an independent predictor of HRS with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.86 and 69.77%, respectively. The baseline MELD score was also an independent risk factor of HRS. MAP drop (OR, 1.582; P=0.000), prothrombin time, HRS, MELD and FIB were independent prognostic factors for 30-day mortality. The area under the ROC curve of MAP drop was 0.808 (P=0.001). Conclusion A decrease in MAP was a valuable predictor of HRS in patients with HBV-related ACLF. MAP drop 9.5 mmHg may be useful for predicting patient prognosis and exploring new treatment measures in patients with HBV-related ACLF.

Introduction
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterized by acute hepatic abnormalities that result from accumulating liver insults in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis [1]. When a liver function fails, the extra-hepatic organs also develop different functional disorders [2]. Specific organ dysfunctions, such as acute kidney injury (AKI), are associated with poor prognosis [2] and necessitate liver transplantation [3]. Due to the high mortality rate of ACLF [1], determining the urgency of liver transplantation is crucial [3,4].

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), also called HRS-AKI, is a life-threatening complication of liver cirrhosis [5,6]. HRS is characterized by functional renal failure due to central underfilling, which is caused by the combination of splanchnic arterial and systemic peripheral vasodilation [7] together with inadequate cardiac output [5,7]. Arterial dilation is a key pathogenic event of HRS, leading to reduction of the effective blood volume, homeostatic activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and induction of renal vasoconstriction by the sympathetic nervous system [3,8]. Several lines of evidence also suggest that HRS may be associated with parenchymal kidney damage. HRS is classified as type I or type II. HRS I involves rapidly progressive renal failure with a very poor short-term prognosis, whereas HRS II is a more moderate and stable renal failure with a median survival of about 6months [3,6].
The management of HRS is still a major challenge. Liver transplantation is the ideal treatment, but organ shortage and the limited window of time for transplants pose important inherent drawbacks [3,9]. Therapies to improve renal perfusion have been tested, including various vasoconstrictors, such as terlipressin, noradrenaline, dopamine and midodrine, with or without the addition of albumin [2,3,6,10]. Unfortunately, these therapies did not demonstrate a survival benefit. At present, most studies focus on how to improve the treatment of patients with HRS [2- 6,10,11], and less effort is put into preventing the occurrence of HRS or diagnosis HRS at an early subclinical stage.
Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers that identify the incidence of HRS or predict the prognosis of end-stage

liver disease. Previous studies have shown that liver volume, serum sodium levels, serum creatinine concentration, urine output and high renin activity can predict HRS in patients with alcoholic v cirrhosis [7]. Montoliu et al. found that age, basal serum creatinine levels and high ceruplasmin (CP) values were independent predictors of HRS in a study of 263 patients [12]. In the same study, HRS was reported in 55% of patients with a 0.7 increase in the renal resistance index from baseline [12]. While most current biomarker studies are performed in alcoholic liver disease. Creatinine, which is the main component of previous HRS predict models, is affected by many factors associated with creatinine generation and excretion [13], and is a delayed and insensitive biomarker of renal function but not kidney injury [14]. Other biomarkers primarily reflect the severity of chronic liver disease or are difficult to follow-up and observe clinically, so they cannot be effectively used for clinical evaluation.
In clinical practice, mean arterial pressure (MAP) is a reliable index of the dysfunction of circulatory compensation in patients with liver cirrhosis ascites [8]. A previous study revealed that arterial blood pressure was independently associated with survival in patients with liver cirrhosis ascites over a period of 1year [15]. Xu et al. showed that increasing MAP from 65 mmHg to the normal level in septic shock patients with previous hypertension was associated with improved microcirculatory function, characterized by increased perfused vessel density and a higher proportion of small perfused vessels [16]. A recent study demonstrated that hypertension history is a protective factor for liver-associated clinical decomposition and mortality [17]. Another study showed that lower MAPs of 50-60 mmHg are positively correlated with higher morbidity in kidney dysfunction cases [18]. Low MAP is also closely associated with hyperdynamic circulation, seroperitoneum and advancement of hepatorenal syndrome, indicating that optimal MAP may be an important prognostic factor in patients with liver cirrhosis ascites [15-18]. In a prospective cohort study, the long-lasting impact of baseline MAP levels on the prognosis of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis ascites was demonstrated [13]. More specifically, a decrease in MAP was a valuable predictor of death in patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis ascites [13]. Together, these studies indicate that MAP may be useful for determining the prognosis and exploring new treatment measures for liver cirrhosis ascites [13]. Although liver cirrhosis is related to HBV-ACLF, the MAP level that should be maintained to determine the prognosis of HBV-ACLF patients remains unclear, and no studies have determined the impact of changes in MAP on HRS occurrence in HBV-ACLF.
Therefore, finding a convenient, noninvasive and clinically accessible indicator is crucial for clinicians to make correct judgments early and conveniently. We propose that researchers should focus on preventing the occurrence of HRS to gain time for improving liver function and maintaining renal function. We anticipate that these efforts will reduce the occurrence of HRS, thereby reducing mortality and extending patient survival.

Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China) between June 2015 and June 2016. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-related ACLF patients, aged 18 to 65years of any gender were included in the study. The diagnoses of CHB and ACLF were made according to the guidelines for CHB and ACLF management as outlined by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the AsiaPacific Association for the Study of Liver. CHB was diagnosed according to the following criteria: the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for 6months and includes measuring levels of HBV-DNA, hepatitis B e antigen and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to determine infectivity, and liver biopsy to assess the liver disease. ACLF was diagnosed according to the following criteria: jaundice and coagulopathy resulting from liver insults in patients with underlying CHB or liver cirrhosis, serum total bilirubin (TBIL) 5 mg/dL or 85µmol/L and prothrombin activity < 40% or international normalized ratio >1.5. Exclusion criteria included infection with any other hepatitis virus, alcoholic liver disease, drug-induced liver disease, active gastrointestinal bleeding, septic shock, underlying renal disease, any carcinoma, cardiac or respiratory failure, renal insufficiency history, pregnancy and liver transplantation history. Diagnosis of type 1 HRS was determined using the criteria proposed by the International Ascites Club [4]: (1) low glomerular filtration rate, as indicated by serum creatinine >133umol/L or 24-h creatinine clearance <40mL/min; (2) absence of shock, ongoing bacterial infection, fluid losses and treatment with nephrotoxic drugs; (3) no improvement in renal function following diuretic withdrawal and plasma volume expansion; (4) proteinuria <500 mg/day and (5) no ultrasonographic evidence of renal parenchymal disease or urinary tract obstruction. 30-days mortality was defined as the number of patients who died within 30days of hospitalization. The research was authorized by the clinical ethics committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University.
Clinical and laboratory assessment
Clinical and biochemical data from routine examinations were collected at the time of inclusion. Laboratory tests included analysis of biochemical indexes of liver function ALT, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, and albumin, TBIL, HBV related tests (HBsAg and HBV DNA titer), liver imaging examination, creatinine, potassium and sodium levels, prothrombin time and platelet count. The blood pressure of the patients was measured by professionally trained healthcare workers when the patient was quiet and awake. Blood pressure was measured every day after admission to the hospital using an electronic sphygmomanometer (Omron HEM-6200, Dalian, China). Measurements were performed three times a day, and an average of three measurements in the day was used for further analyses. MAP at every measurement point was calculated (MAP=1/3 SBP+2/3 DBP).

and followed by 10g albumin infusions daily, if plasma albumin is less than 35g/L. If plasma albumin is less than 30g/L in patients with ascites, 20g albumin was given to the patients daily. All the patients were given antiviral therapy with entecavir for chronic hepatitis B and 400 ml fresh plasma every 2days.
Statistical analyses
The results are expressed as mean with SD or as median with range. Comparisons between groups were performed using Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test or Fisher's exact test. A value of P<0.05 on both sides was considered significant. The survival curves were generated using the COX method and compared with the log-rank test. Logistic analyses were performed to determine baseline predictors of HRS. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated, and the area under the curve was calculated. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 23.0 statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) and R package [R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05)].
Results
Baseline patient characteristics
During the study period from June 2015 to June 2016, a total of 420 ACLF patients were admitted to the 3rd affiliated hospital of Sun-yat Sen University. Of these patients, 335 patients were included according to the including criteria. Totally 91were excluded based on complicated with other primary diseases or other causes of ACLF besides

HBV infection (Fig. 1). In the remaining 244 patients, 187 patients were excluded based on severe complications related to ACLF or BP data incomplete. In total 57 patients were assessed for eligibility (Fig. 1).
Total 57 final identified HBV-related ACLF patients were divided into HRS group (n=14) and non-HRS group (n=43). The baseline clinical characteristics of all patients are shown in Table 1. The average age of the HRS patients was 53.21±13.38years, with a male predominance (12/14, 85.71%). And in non-HRS patients were 45.02±11.74years, which was significantly younger than the patients in the HRS group (P=0.033), with a male predominance(37/43, 86.05%). Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, albumin, Fib and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values for patients in the HRS group were 36.09±8.36, 29.09±9.41 mg/l, 1.17±0.39g/l and 8.44±8.12µmol/l, respectively, and those in the non-HRS group were 27.64±5.87, 33.30±5.19g/l, 1.50±0.52g/l and 4.08±2.38µmol/l, respectively, all of these parameters were significantly different between the two groups. In conclusion, patients in the HRS group were older and had higher MELD scores than patients in the non-HRS group. There was no difference in viral load levels between the HRS and non-HRS groups (P=0.233), and none of the patients in the HRS group received anti-HBV treatment prior to hospital admittance. One patient in the non-HRS group received anti-HBV therapy, and the HBV DNA level was below the detective level in this patient. There was no difference in cases of HBsAg level between the two groups (P=0.052) (Table 1). The 30-day mortality rates were 57 and 20% in the HRS and non-HRS groups, respectively.

Analysis of baseline variables predicting hepatorenal syndrome
To assess the association of baseline variables and HRS, the following parameters were tested by the logistic regression analyses: age, albumin, Fib, MELD score and BUN. These variables showed significant differences between the HRS and non-HRS groups. Creatinine was not used in the logistic regression, as the MELD score was calculated using the creatinine values. We found that only the MELD score was associated with a significantly increased risk of HRS [odds ratio (OR), 1.182; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.067-1.309].
Analysis of baseline variables predicting survival
All patients were divided into survival and nonsurvival groups, and data were collected for 30days to calculate the in-hospital mortality rate. Prothrombin time, Fib and the MELD score were significantly different in the survival and nonsurvival groups (Table 2). Eight patients were diagnosed with HRS in the nonsurvival group, and seven patients without HRS died during the follow-up period. There was a significant difference in HRS diagnosis between the survival and nonsurvival groups(X2=9.095; P=0.003).
To assess baseline variables that predict survival, the following parameters were tested by forward stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression analysis: prothrombin time, Fib, MELD score and HRS diagnosis. We found that prothrombin time, HRS, MELD and Fib independently predicted 30-day survival in HBV-ACLF patients (Table 3).
Mean arterial pressures falls before hepatorenal syndrome development
Although the baseline MELD score predicted HRS in HBV-ACLF patients, it was unclear when the patients

developed HRS and whether treatment could prevent HRS occurrence. As baseline MAP was not different between the HRS and non-HRS groups, we collected MAP measurements during the course of the hospital stay. We found that MAPs dropped 12.02±2.98 mmHg before HRS diagnosis. In contrast, MAPs only dropped 7.89±3.80 mmHg in non-HRS patients throughout the in-hospital period (P<0.05) (Fig. 2). In the HRS group, MAP-drop lasted for 3.79±1.528days, whereas in the non-HRS group, MAP-drop lasted for 1.58±0.932days (P<0.01). For the 14 patients in the HRS group, the average time from MAP drop to HRS happen is 5.36±1.865days.
Mean arterial pressures drop is an independent risk
factor for hepatorenal syndrome development in
hepatitis B virus - acute-on-chronic liver failure patients
To evaluate whether the drop in MAP could predict HRS, a ROC curve was constructed. MAP drop was a very good predictor of HRS in patients with HBV-ALCF (AUROCs=0.808). Creatinine level, BUN and MELD were also markers of HRS in patients with HBV-ALCF (AUROCs>0.70 and >0.80) (Fig. 3). However, creatinine and BUN cannot predict HRS prior to the occurrence and MELD cannot be corrected rapidly. As MAP was predictive of HRS and can be improved in a relatively short time, we went on to determine the specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (LR+) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) for different cutoff MAP drop values. We found that a cutoff MAP drop value of 9.5 mmHg predicted the risk of HRS in patients with HBV-ACLF with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR+ and LR- of 92.86, 69.77, 50.0, 96.77%, 0.10 and 3.07, respectively (Table 4).

Mean arterial pressures drop is an independent risk factor for the 30-day mortality of hepatitis B virus acute-on-chronic liver failure patients
Next, we performed forward stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression analysis in all patients and found that the MAP drop (OR, 1.582; 95% CI, 1.317-1.900; P=0.000) could predict 30-day mortality.
Discussion
The present study demonstrated that patients who developed HRS were older, had greater drops in MAP, and had higher MELD scores than those who did not have HRS (P<0.05). A MAP drop 9.5 mmHg was an important independent predictor of HRS in HBV-ACLF patients. The results of this retrospective study suggest that reversal of MAP may be effective and well tolerated preventive measures for type 1 HRS in HBV-ACLF patients. This study also provides new insight into the role of circulation dysfunction in the development of HRS in HBV-ACLF.
ACLF develops in acute decompensation of cirrhosis and is defined by hepatic and extra-hepatic organ failure [2,3]. ACLF is also characterized by high mortality, ranging from 23 to 74% [1,2]. In critically ill patients, the severe complications of ACLF (e.g. HRS, hepatic

encephalopathy, hepatopulmonary syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, etc.) are associated with poor quality of life and short survival [13,19]. This study evaluated a drop in MAP as a predictor of HRS, which is a very severe complication of ACLF. HRS occurs in 25-50% of patients with cirrhosis admitted to the hospital with an episode of acute decompensation [20]. HRS is a strong predictor of poor survival in both the short and long term [2]. Hospitalized cirrhotic patients with HRS do not survive their admission, and demonstrate1- and 12-month mortality rates of 58 and 63%, respectively. In our study, 57.14% of HRS patients (8/14) died during the 30-day observation period in the hospital. In contrast, the 30-day mortality rate of ACLF patients who did not have HRS was 13.95% (6/43). Thus, preventing HRS may significantly improve the survival of ACLF patients.
There are many new parameters besides the traditional biomarkers that predict HRS. Urinary sodium excretion is a common indicator of HRS [4,7], however, sodium excretion can be affected by many factors, such as diuretic administration. Other biomarkers associated with HRS include serum cystatin C, urinary and serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), urinary IL-18, kidney injury molecule 1, liver-type fatty acid-binding protein, insulin-like growth factor and tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase [21]. These novel biomarkers increase

with the severity of the liver injury and are predictive of outcomes. In addition, urinary infection, which is more prevalent in patients with ACLF, can also increase urinary biomarker excretion. Therefore, further study is required to develop efficient and controllable biomarkers to aid in diagnosing HRS early to improve clinical outcomes. In our study, we analyzed clinical markers and found that Fib, prothrombin time, MELD score, albumin and BUN were significantly different in the HRS and non-HRS groups. Interestingly, only the MELD score was a predictor of HRS. These results are similar to a previous study, which found that patients with a poor liver condition and severe ACLF will develop more complications, including HRS [1,5,8,13,22]. More importantly, these parameters cannot be corrected rapidly, which limits the treatment potential for patients suspected to be at risk of developing HRS. Based on the effect of MAP in reflecting circulation volume and can be improved in a short time, we consider it an interesting factor to look at. Then, we compared the baseline MAP in the two groups and found no significant difference or the predictive ability for HRS. However, we discovered that HRS patients suffered a MAP drop prior to HRS occurrence. Using ROC curve analysis, we selected a cutoff for MAP drop 9.5 mmHg to predict HRS.
ACLF patients show evidence of severe cardiovascular dysfunction. They can have both increased and decreased cardiac output [3,4,6]. Increased cardiac output is a compensation period performance and will be developed into

decreased cardiac output, which may result in renal hypoperfusion and ischemia [3,4,9,13]. A significant change in patients with cirrhosis is portal hypertension, which accelerates the release and generation of endogenous vasodilators into visceral blood circulation. The release of these vasodilators results in splanchnic vasodilatation, blood volume expansion and increased mesenteric blood flow [3,13,22]. Finally, the total effective arterial blood volume decreases, and leads to systemic circulatory dysfunction. Renal perfusion is one of the most affected organs [2,13]. Studies on arterial hypertension in patients with cirrhosis have shown that the prevalence of hypertension is reduced [23] and that high arterial blood pressure is a beneficial predictive factor of hepatic decompensation and liver disease-associated death [15,17]. The vasodilatory complications of hepatorenal syndrome and hepatopulmonary syndrome can be prevented in patients with high arterial blood pressure [13]. MAP is regarded as the perfusion pressure required maintaining blood flow to the organs and is considered the most important hemodynamic measure of the function of the circulation system [13]. MAP is also the determining factor for maintaining cerebral and renal blood flow [16,18]. A previous study revealed that arterial blood pressure was independently associated with survival in patients with liver cirrhosis ascites over a period of 1year [15]. Another study reported that baseline MAP was an independent correlative factor of 5-year mortality in patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis ascites [13].

Fig. 3. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves of different variables for predicting Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) in patients with hepatitis B virus- Acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ALCF). Mean artery pressure (MAP) drop (a), model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores (b), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (c), fibrinogen (FIB) (d) and albumin (e).

Moreover, a meta-analysis suggested that the use of terlipressin or noradrenaline improves MAP, which results in higher urine output and reversal of both types of HRS [11]. These results indicate that once HRS has occurred, hemodynamic and renal function disorders may develop. Therefore, preventing or correcting pre-clinical HRS may be more valuable than treating HRS.
Our results revealed that a MAP decrease of at least 9.5 mmHg was a notable predictor of HRS occurrence in patients with HBV-ACLF. Like the baseline MELD score[1], the MAP drop proved to be an independent correlative factor of 30-day mortality during hospital stays. The AUROC values were all greater than 0.8, indicating a satisfactory predictive ability. MAP drop was one of the most consistent and independent predictors of HRS in

patients. Therefore, MAP should be monitored for drops as an optimal predictor of HRS in patients with HBVACLF. In addition, changes in MAP are indicative of treatment efficacy when using albumin and vasoconstrictors to improve blood pressure.
Our study has a number of limitations. First, we did not calculate a sample size a priori. For this is a retrospect study, many clinical data were incomplete. The relatively low number of patients included in this study necessitates validation of our results in larger cohorts. Our study only included one hospital, limiting the external generalizability of our results. The use of cardiac output monitoring or central venous pressure values was not used to aid with volume assessment in this study. Thus, we did not have a direct indicator of the effective circulating blood

volume. Finally, whether MAP drop is a cause or consequence of renal dysfunction in HBV-ACLF and organ failure development is not understood. Therefore, additional studies addressing whether elevated MAP prevents HRS occurrence are necessary and require a randomized controlled clinical design. To this end, we have registered a clinical study to evaluate the effect of terlipressin on the prevention of HRS by improving mean arterial pressure (NCT02489864).
In conclusion, the most important discovery of this retrospective study was that a MAP drop 9.5 mmHg was one of the most important predictors of HRS in patients with HBV-ACLF during short-term follow-up. Our results may be extended to predict patient prognosis and to explore new treatment measures directed at optimizing the treatment of HBV-ACLF patients.

Understanding of molecular mechanisms in natural killer cell therapy
Suk Ran Yoon1,2,3, Tae-Don Kim1,2,3 and Inpyo Choi1,2
Cancer cells and the immune system are closely related and thus influence each other. Although immune cells can suppress cancer cell growth, cancer cells can evade immune cell attack via immune escape mechanisms. Natural killer (NK) cells kill cancer cells by secreting perforins and granzymes. Upon contact with cancer cells, NK cells form immune synapses to deliver the lethal hit. Mature NK cells are differentiated from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. They move to lymph nodes, where they are activated through interactions with dendritic cells. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a key molecule that activates mature NK cells. The adoptive transfer of NK cells to treat incurable cancer is an attractive approach. A certain number of activated NK cells are required for adoptive NK cell therapy. To prepare these NK cells, mature NK cells can be amplified to obtain sufficient numbers of NK cells. Alternatively, NK cells can be differentiated and amplified from hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, the selection of donors is important to achieve maximal efficacy. In this review, we discuss the overall procedures and strategies of NK cell therapy against cancer.

INTRODUCTION As we gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling natural killer (NK) cell activity, the potential of their possible application in cancer immunotherapy grows increasingly. NK cells play key roles in innate and adaptive immune responses through unique NK cell activation mechanisms during early host defense against viruses and tumors by performing two major roles: contact-dependent cytotoxicity and cytokine production for immune modulation. Target cell apoptosis is primarily mediated by perforin (Prf1)- and granzyme B (GzmB)-mediated pathways and the regulation of immune responses is mediated by the secretion of cytokines such as interferon- and tumor-necrosis factor-.1-3
Compared with T and B cells, our understanding of the checkpoints and the developmental stages that lead to the generation of cells committed to the NK cell lineage remain poorly defined. The developmental processes that drive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) into NK cells are being identified.4 Emerging experimental evidence suggests that NK cell differentiation depends on defined cytokines, the temporal induction of several transcription factors and microRNA (miRNA)-based gene expression.5 Recently, several research groups have

developed protocols for in vitro NK cell differentiation based on reconstitution with cytokines, providing a good strategy for amplifying NK cells for therapeutic applications.6-8 Recent advances in understanding the manipulation of NK cell activation and development have led to the hope that NK cells could be harnessed as an immunotherapy for cancers and other diseases.
This review provides the framework for understanding the impact of NK cell activation, development/differentiation and its clinical implications. We summarize sequential activation processes such as priming, immune synapse formation, receptor signaling, effector functions and its manipulation for tuning NK cell activity. In addition, fundamental questions are discussed concerning the development of successful NK cellbased therapies.
NK CELL ACTIVATION Current insights into the molecular specificities that regulate NK cell functions in vivo suggest that it might be possible to design NK cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies against human cancer. In this section, we review the overall processes of the NK cell activation mechanisms, including receptor

Receptor signaling NK cell activation is controlled by a dynamic balance between the positive and negative signals provided by two main types of receptors.1,2,10,11 The receptors--NKG2D, NKp46, NKp30, NKp44, the activating form of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) known as KIR-S and CD16--provide positive signals, finally triggering cytotoxicity and the production of cytokines. Some of these activating cell surface receptors stimulate protein tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways through reversible associations with transmembrane signaling adaptors. These adaptor proteins harbor cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs that consist of a consensus amino-acid sequence with paired tyrosines and leucines (Yxx(I/ L)x6-12Yxx(I/L)).12 These motifs are normally located in the cytoplasmic domains of ligand-binding transmembrane receptors, such as the T cell receptor and high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptor (FcRI), and mediate interactions between the transmembrane receptor complex and protein tyrosine kinases that are required to initiate early and late signaling events. Additional cell surface receptors that are not directly coupled to immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs also participate in NK cell activation. These include NKG2D, which is well associated with the DAP10 transmembrane signaling adaptor, as well as integrins and cytokine receptors.9 The discovery of NKG2D ligands, such as MICA, the RAET1 family and the NKp30 ligand B7H6 suggests that such receptors recognize molecules that are rarely present on normal cells but are upregulated during infection or carcinogenesis (Figure 1).
NK cells also express cell surface inhibitory receptors that antagonize activating pathways through protein tyrosine phosphatases.4,12 The typical inhibitory receptor KIR recognizes `self' and subsequently provides negative signals finally to suppress NK cell activation by inhibition of stimulatory signaling pathway. The ligand of KIR is major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules of the self that is present on normal cells.3 These inhibitory cell surface receptors are characterized by intracytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs2 present in the cytoplasmic domains of several inhibitory receptors. After ligand binding, intracytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs are phosphorylated on their tyrosine residues and recruit lipid or tyrosine phosphatases. The tyrosine phosphorylation status of several signaling components that are substrates for both protein tyrosine kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatases is thus key molecules to the propagation of the NK cell effector pathways. Understanding the integration of these multiple signals is central to the understanding and manipulation of NK cell effector signaling pathways (Figure 1).
Cytokines are important signals for regulating the proliferation, survival, activation status and effector functions of the immune system. In addition, NK cell development, survival

Figure 1 Natural killer (NK) cell activation and its translation to therapeutic application. The encounter between the NK cell and target cell results in adhesion and conjugation (Immune Synapse). The dynamic balance between inhibitory and activating receptor signaling at the cell-cell interface decides the outcome of the immune synapse. Engagement of NK cell activating receptors induces the phosphorylation of ITAM or kinase and tight actin cytoskeleton rearrangements that, in turn, lead to a more stable conjugation (Activation). NK cells can be primed or activated by cytokines locally secreted by other immune cells, inducing various types of immune-related gene expression including cytokines, NK cell effectors and noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs). Sustained stimulatory signaling causes robust actin polymerization and polarization of the MTOC to the immune synapse. Lytic granules containing effectors (for example, GzmB and Prf1) are transported along microtubule tracks for subsequent release. Prf1 and GzmB can induce target cell apoptosis. Upon activation, cytokines, including pro-inflammatory cytokines (for example, interferon- (IFN-)), are also secreted for immune regulation (NK cell functions). Major strategies to harness NK cell functions in cancer (Tuning NK cell activity). First, treatment with cytokines promotes NK cell proliferation, differentiation and activation and/or inhibits NK cell suppressors. Second, manipulating the balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signaling can promote NK cell activation through the use of CAR and/or adoptive transfer of allosteric NK cells. In addition, these strategies are focused on NK effector activation by promoting TRAIL (tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)related apoptosis-inducing ligand) or CD178 expression, as well as ADCC activation via engineered Fc. Third, these strategies may be enhanced by anti-inhibitory antibodies specific for negative regulators such as KIR, NKG2A and PD1.

for activation, based on studies on IL-15 or IL-15 receptordeficient mice.14,15 In a recent report on the development of innate NK cell memory, a brief, combined activation with IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18 resulted in the generation of long-lived NK cells that exhibited enhanced functionality when they encountered a secondary stimulation,16 providing a new possibility of enhancing NK cell responsiveness to viral infections and tumors. An improved understanding of the cellular and molecular networks of cytokine-cytokine receptor signals has led to a resurgence of interest in the clinical use of cytokines that can sustain and/or activate NK cell antitumor potential.
Immune synapse formation As with other immune cells, the majority of NK cell effector functions require direct cell-to-cell contact. Target cell binding is accompanied by the creation of complex structures at the cell-cell interface, often considered the immune synapse.12,17 This concept was first proposed by DM Davis in 1999 as the `missing-self' recognition in inhibitory interactions.18 Recent progress has contributed to the characterization of several types of NK cell immunological synapses and has demonstrated that NK cell immune synapses are the primary sites where the highly complex regulation of NK cell activity occurs.9,19 The NK cell immunological synapse is the dynamic interface formed between an NK cell and its target cell. The formation of the NK cell immunological synapse involves several distinct stages, from the initiation of contact with a target cell to the directed delivery of lytic granule contents for target cell lysis.17 Progression through the individual stages is regulated, and this tight regulation underlies the precision with which NK cells select and kill susceptible target cells, including virally infected transformed cells and tumor cells that they encounter during their surveillance of the body.

on the target cell induces the phosphorylation of membrane proximal signaling molecules and the formation of a signaling complex comprising many signaling and adapter molecules at the junction. Positive feedback loops are generated, causing signal amplification and sustained signaling that induce more robust actin polymerization at the synapse zone and polarization of the microtubule-organizing center and lytic granules to the immunological synapse, where Prf1 and GzmB from lytic granules are subsequently exocytosed to the target cell membrane.12
MicroRNAs in NK cell biology The miRNAs are an abundant class of endogenous small noncoding RNAs (19-22 nucleotides) generated by the sequential processing of primary miRNA transcripts by the ribonucleases Drosha in the nucleus and Dicer1 in the cytoplasm. Mature miRNAs associate with the 3' untranslated regions of specific target mRNAs to downregulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs for translational suppression or mRNA degradation. Recently, the involvement of miRNAs in immune responses and the development of NK cells from hematopoietic stem cells has been widely investigated by gain and loss of function of specific miRNAs or by disruption of the molecules involved in the biogenesis/activity of all miRNAs (for example, Argonaute, Drosha and Dicer).21 The miRNAs also regulate fundamental NK cell processes such as development, proliferation, cytotoxicity and cytokine production, as shown in Table 1. The growing evidence for the impact of miRNAs on NK cell biology suggests that modulating the endogenous levels of a specific miRNA in NK cells represents a potential strategy for immunotherapy.5,22
Tuning of NK cell activation Upon tuning the threshold for NK cell activation, NK cells can exert effector functions against transformed self while

Effector molecules Several killing pathways in NK cell cytotoxicity have been characterized.1,4 First, the Prf1- and GzmB-mediated mechanism demonstrates that granzymes are serine proteases that are found primarily in the cytoplasmic granules of NK cells. Prf1 facilitates the delivery of Gzms into the cytosol of the target cell, whereas GzmB, the best-characterized Gzm, cleaves several procaspases and other intracellular substrates to initiate the classical apoptotic pathways. Second, the CD95 (FAS)-CD178 (FAS ligand) pathway leads to the formation of a deathinducing signaling complex and the subsequent activation of caspases that promote the apoptotic process of the CD95expressing target cell. Third, the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity mechanism is used by leukocytes, including NK cells that express CD16 (Fc receptors) to kill antibody-coated target cells (Figure 1).
Among these cytotoxic effector molecules, the most general and best-known effectors are Prf1 and GzmB.20 The contact between an NK cell and a susceptible target cell results in conjugation and the formation of the immunological synapse. The stimulation of NK cell-activating receptors by their ligands

sustaining tolerance to normal self. Recent progress in under-
standing NK cell biology brings this approach into the realm of clinical trials. An emerging idea is that the threshold of NK cell reactivity is tuned by their interactions with the environment. As shown in the lower panel of Figure 1, the strategies used to
harness NK cell functions in cancer therapy can be summarized into three categories:23 (1) enhancing receptor signaling by manipulating the balance between inhibitory and activating NK receptors and NK cell effector functions, (2) blocking negative regulators through the use of monoclonal antibodies and (3)
treatment involving cytokines that promote NK cell proliferation, viability and activity.
NK CELL GENERATION
NK cell development NK cells have been known to originate from hematopoietic precursor cells in the bone marrow (BM).24 However, hematopoietic precursor cells are also found in the lymph nodes and secondary lymphoid tissues,8 the maternal decida25 and the thymus and liver of the fetus.26,27 Nevertheless, NK cell development primarily occurs in the BM microenvironment.
In general, NK cells are derived from CD34+ HSCs through discrete stages of development, such as precursor NK (pNK), immature NK (iNK) and mature NK, and are characterized by
the sequential acquisition of surface receptors and effector function.28,29 HSCs give rise to different hematopoietic lineages via common lymphoid progenitors and common myeloid progenitors. Common lymphoid progenitors differentiate into
NK/T progenitors that have the potential to develop into T and/or NK cells. Following this, NK/T cells differentiate into pNK and iNK and finally into mature NK.8,30 Recently, Grzywacz et al.31 demonstrated that NK cells could also be
derived from myeloid precursors such as common myeloid progenitors and the CD33+CD13+ population. The transition from NK/T to pNK cells is defined by the expression of IL-2/15R (the CD122 receptor).26 Along with IL-2R expression, IL-7, stem cell factor and Flt3L (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand) commit HSCs to the NK lineage.32 In humans, pNKs are characterized by the CD34+CD122+CD56- phenotype, and these pNK cells then respond to IL-15, a critical factor for the final maturation of NK cells.
As the cells differentiate from pNK to iNK cells, the expression of Flt3 and IL-7R decreases, whereas the expression of IL-2R, CD2 and 2B4 (CD244) increases.33,34 The iNK cells are identified by the expression of CD161 that is supported by a population of CD3-CD56-CD161+ cells that were found during in vitro NK cell differentiation from CD34+ Lin- umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells.35 Although IL-15 is known to be indispensable for NK cell development,36,37 the generation of pNKs from HSCs is likely an IL-15-independent mechanism.38 IL-15 and its specific receptor, IL-15R, mediate NK cell development from committed pNKs and promote their differentiation into iNK cells.39
The final maturation of NK cells is characterized by the acquisition of activating and inhibitory receptor expression. The activating receptor NKp44 is the first NK cell receptor to

be expressed at the early stage of NK cell maturation. The NKp46, NKp30, NKG2D and DNAM-1 activating receptors are acquired at a later stage. The first inhibitory receptor to be expressed during in vitro NK cell differentiation is CD94/ NKG2A.8 The NK cell maturation process also includes the MHC class I-induced NK `education' or `licensing' that involves the recognition of self-MHC class I molecules by cognate inhibitory receptors such as KIRs.40,41 Further steps of NK cell maturation are required for the acquisition of the cytolytic machinery, such as perforin and granzymes.42
Factors involved in NK differentiation Although the developmental pathways of NK cells are relatively unclear compared with that of T and B lymphocytes, the process of NK cell differentiation seems to be a coordinated mechanism that involves many cytokines, surface receptors and transcription factors.
The BM microenvironment is a major source of cytokines that initiates and facilitates NK differentiation. Within the BM, stromal cells assist the full maturation of NK cells,43,44 suggesting that the BM stroma itself is one of the critical factors for the differentiation of NK cells. Although the intact BM microenvironment is essential for NK differentiation, the stromal cell requirement might be replaced, at least partially, by early-acting cytokines, including stem cell factor, Flt3L and IL7,32,45 that induce CD122 responsiveness through their receptors on pNKs.
Transcription factors are also involved in controlling the NK cell differentiation process. The Ets family (for example, PU.1 and Ets-1) and the Ikaros family (for example, Ikaros, Helios and Aiolos)46-48 are essential for the generation of NK cells in vivo by the specification or maintenance of pNKs. The inhibitors of DNA binding (Id proteins) including ID2 and ID3,49 as well as E4BP4,50 also regulate cell-fate decisions in the early stage of NK development. In addition, we have reported that VDUP-1 (vitamin D3 upregulated protein 1), a stressresponse gene, regulates NK differentiation by controlling both CD122 expression and IL-15 responsiveness.51 Transcription factors, including Gata-3,52 IRF-2,53 and Tox,6,54 are involved in the final maturation of NK cells; thus, their absence leads to the incomplete development of functional NK cells or immature phenotypes of NK cells. The acquisition of mature NK cell function is also related to the presence of Eomesodermin (EOMES) and T cell-specific T-box transcription factor (T-bet) 55 that induce the expression of the cytolytic machinery (for example, perforin and granzymes) and interferon-.6,54,56
Production of NK cells in vitro Recently, NK cell immunotherapy has been developing rapidly. Achieving NK cell immunotherapy for cancer requires not only an adequate number of NK cells but also NK cell purity and functional activity. Human NK cells can be obtained either directly or indirectly from various sources, such as peripheral blood (PB), UCB, BM, embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).29

NK cell generation efficiency from PB or UCB. NK cells can be directly isolated from PB or UCB and expanded for short or long periods of time in vitro and subsequently infused for
cancer treatment. Several protocols have been developed for the expansion of PB NK cells for clinical studies.57 Purified PB NK cells have been expanded using various feeder cells, such as autologous irradiated feeder cells and third-party Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid B cell lines.58,59 In addition, genetically modified K562 cells, including K562 cells transduced with IL-21,60 or K562 cells double transduced with IL-15 and 4-1BB (CD137) ligand (K562-mb15-41BBL),61 have been used as feeder cells for NK co-culture systems. The main
advantage of these methods is the immediate availability of the cells after long-term expansion in vitro compared with the de novo production of NK cells. However, the prolonged exposure of NK cells to cytokines in vitro induces cell exhaustion that
may lead to a low functional activity of NK cells. Moreover, the complete removal of any residual viable tumor feeder in final cell products should be required for NK cell immunotherapy.
Alternatively, NK cells can be selectively isolated from UCB, which is considered a good source for cell therapy. Positively
isolated cord blood NK cells cultured on a feeder layer of
mesenchymal stromal cells using a combination of IL-2, IL-15, Flt3L and IL-3 achieved an  60-fold expansion.62 However, because of the low initial numbers of NK cells in UCB, this is
not a feasible approach for generating the cell numbers
required for application in NK cell therapy. To overcome the
obstacles in directly isolating NK cells from fresh samples, NK cells can be generated from CD34+ HSCs in vitro. Generating NK cells from CD34+ stem cells can be advantageous because
stem cells can be isolated and frozen. Furthermore, NK cells
can be manipulated during the process of differentiation from HSCs in vitro.63
NK cell generation from UCB CD34+ stem cells. It has been shown that NK cells are originated from the CD34+ stem cell compartment in vivo.64 Therefore, NK cells can be generated in vitro from CD34+ HSCs from BM33,45 or UCB65,66 using
different combinations of cytokines, BM stromal cells and
culture media supplemented with animal or human sera.
However, these culture systems contain components of animal origin and fail to produce significant numbers of NK cells. Kao et al.67 demonstrated that using fetal bovine serum, UCB CD34+ cells differentiated into NK cells with a purity of 40-60%, finally reaching a 300-fold expansion. Using complete medium containing human serum, fetal bovine serum and
cytokines including IL-15 and IL-21, methylprednisolone has been shown to induce the rapid differentiation of CD34+ HSCs into NK cells, attaining a 10-fold expansion of NK cells.68 In addition, Spanholtz et al.69,70 developed a novel cell culture technique for the ex vivo expansion and differentiation of NK cells from UCB CD34+ cells in the absence of feeder cells using
a serum-free culture medium coupled with a mixture of
heparin and cytokines that mimic the extracellular matrix of the BM microenvironment. In this protocol, up to 1010 CD34+
cell-derived NK cells without T-cell contamination could be

generated. However, a transplantation study using nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice receiving human HSCs demonstrated that NK cell differentiation from UCB CD34+ cells was slower and less efficient than NK cell differentiation from BM CD34+ cells.66 Furthermore, that study also demonstrated that UCB CD34+ cells differentiated into NK cells lacking the expression of KIRs, including CD158a (KIR2DL1), CD158b (KIR2DL2/DL3) and NKB1.66 Co-culture with the feeder layer EL08.1D2 has shown that UCB CD34+ -derived NK cells acquired the coordinated NK cell receptors that represent cytotoxic CD56+ cells.71
NK cell generation from BM or mobilized PB. Because NK cells are developed in the BM microenvironment in vivo, the BM may be a rich source of CD34+ stem cells. NK cells with mature properties have been successfully generated using sorted CD34+ cells from the BM.28,45 The main disadvantages of working with BM stem cells are the limitations in cell number and the painful procedure of harvesting cells. To facilitate harvesting, stem cells can alternatively be mobilized using the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.72 Giuliani et al.73 generated differentiated NK cells from mobilized PB stem cells to study the effect of membrane-bound IL-15. In 2010, we developed a protocol for generating NK cells using isolated CD34+ cells from mobilized PB for clinical trials and performed allogeneic NK cell transfer after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).74 Recently, we also developed a novel protocol for the generation of NK cells using T cell-depleted mononuclear cells from mobilized PB that allows for a shorter time period of differentiation and the generation of increased NK cell numbers compared with the earlier protocol.75
NK cell generation from hESCs. Because hESCs or iPSCs can give rise to CD34+ HSCs, they may serve as a source for NK cell differentiation.76 Knorr et al.77 engineered CD34+ cells, hESCs or iPSCs that expressed chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) specific for tumor-associated antigens for immunotherapy. However, the generation of NK cells from hESCs and iPSCs is still in the experimental phase, and the generation of CD34+ HSCs from hESCs and iPSCs for hESC- and iPSCbased NK cell therapies still requires optimization.77-79
In summary, the methods for NK cell production in vitro for application in immunotherapy are shown in Figure 2.
NK CELL THERAPY Because of their ability to recognize and lyse broad range of tumor cells without prior priming, NK cells emerged as promising candidates for cancer therapy. Because NK cells are found primarily in the blood, NK therapy has been most successful in hematopoietic malignancies, such as leukemias. NK cell immunotherapy can be achieved by either activating endogenous NK cell response by administering NK stimulants or using exogenous NK cells via HSCT or adoptive cell transfer. Several strategies for NK cell immunotherapies for human cancer have been proposed.10

Figure 2 Production of natural killer (NK) cells in vitro for immunotherapy. Human NK cells can be obtained from various sources, such as
peripheral blood (PB), umbilical cord blood (UCB), bone marrow (BM), mobilized PB (mPB) or embryonic stem cells (ESCs). NK cells can be isolated from PB or UCB and expanded. In addition, NK cells can be generated using CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from UCB, BM, mPB or ESCs. CD34+ HSCs are differentiated into CD56+ mature NK cells (mNK) via CD122+ precursor NK cells (pNK).
Finally, mNK cells armed with effector functions are infused into the patient for adoptive immunotherapy.

Activation of endogenous NK cell response Nonfunctional NK cells are frequently found in cancer patients; thus, exogenous NK activators may be used to enhance the endogenous NK response to tumors. Cytokines, including IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-21 and type I interferons, have been used to activate endogenous NK cells both directly and indirectly.80,81 The administration of IL-2 has been shown to activate and expand NK cell populations in some cancer patients,82,83 although IL-2 treatment is limited by severe side effects. To reduce the side effects of IL-2, combination therapy using IL-2 together with IL-12 and IL-21 has been proposed.84 IL-15 is a promising candidate for activating NK cells because IL-15 is indispensable for NK cell maturation. When combined with chemotherapy, the administration of IL-15 potentiated antitumor effects.85 In addition, several immunomodulators have been shown to increase the activity of NK cells against tumor cells. For example, thalidomide and lenalidomide increased the number of peripheral blood NK cells and activated NK function against myeloma cells that may be mediated through the stimulation of IL-2 production by T cells.86-88 Similarly, the adjuvant intravesical bacillus Calmette- Guerin89 and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides40 have been used to enhance antitumor activity in superficial bladder cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, has also been applied to increase the susceptibility of tumor cells by the upregulation of death receptors that trigger cytolysis by NK cells.90
NK cell adoptive immunotherapy Adoptive immunotherapy refers to the introduction of ex vivomanipulated cells to patients for clinical applications. NK cells can be isolated, expanded or produced in vitro to be transferred in an autologous or allogeneic setting. The first trial involving

adoptive transfer of NK cells for antitumor therapy was performed by Rosenberg91 using a combination of ex vivoexpanded autologous lymphokine-activated killer cells and exogenous IL-2. However, this trial induced only a 20% response, including partial and complete responses, a rate similar to the antitumor effect achieved by the administration of high-dose IL-2 alone.92
Unlike autologous cell transfers, allogeneic adoptive cell transfers have the benefit of mismatched KIR/KIR ligands between the host and donor NK cells, although these therapies run a great risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that can cause severe damage to host tissues. Ruggeri et al.93 first identified a correlation between donor KIR and host KIR ligand expression in the occurrence of tumor relapse. Compared with KIR-matched transplants, KIR mismatches, in which donor NK cells express KIRs that have no ligand in the patient, produced graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effects in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. In 2005, Miller et al.94 performed a combined therapy of haploidentical NK cell infusion together with IL-2 administration for AML patients in a nontransplantation setting. This study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of adoptively transferred human NK cells, with 26% of AML patients achieving complete remission. An infusion of haploidentical allogeneic NK cells has also been applied to patients with poor prognosis in Hodgkin's lymphoma95 and various solid tumors, such as melanoma and renal cancer.96 Another approach of adoptive immunotherapy using the NK lymphoma-derived cell line NK-92 has been proposed, although limited data exist on the efficacy of this approach.97 To date, the adoptive transfer therapy of NK cells can be applied either alone or in combination with allogeneic stem cell transplantation by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI).

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT is a therapy that is often applied for hematological malignancies and can be classified as autologous or allogeneic depending on the source of the donor cells. Currently, allogeneic stem cell transplantation from unrelated or sibling donors have been used for several hematological malignancies, such as AML and acute lymphoblast leukemia.63,93
Allogeneic HSCT requires a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched donor from which BM cells are harvested and infused into the patient. Because T cell receptors are highly individualized and sensitive to non-self presentation, recipient antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells may aberrantly activate donor-derived T cells. In the recipient, these activated T cells mediate the severe damage characteristic of GVHD. Conversely, donor-derived T cells also recognize and kill residual tumor cells in the recipient, referred to as the GVT or the graft-versus-leukemia effect. The current strategies used to improve the outcome of allogeneic HSCT in cancer therapy are focused on minimizing harmful GVDH reactions while maximizing beneficial GVT effects. To reduce the risk of GVHD, T cells are often required to be depleted from donor grafts, eliminating GVHD at the expense of inhibiting GVT effects.98 Unlike T cells, NK cells have been demonstrated to enhance GVT effects without the implication of GVHD.99
Allogeneic NK cells in stem cell transplantation Unfortunately, many patients relapse after HSCT. To prevent relapses in patients after HSCT, DLI can be used to induce potent GVT effect, although DLI may cause T cell-induced GVHD. To minimize the risk of GVHD, T cell-depleted DLI has been applied. The introduction of T cell-depleted donor lymphocytes containing alloreactive NK cells improved the survival of patients by enhancing graft-versus-leukemia effect and reducing GVHD.100 DLI using purified donor NK cells has been shown to facilitate engraftment and induce GVT effects without contributing to GVHD in haploidentical HSCT.101 GVT effects can be mediated by both donor-derived NK cells and NK cells that developed from donor hematopoietic stem cells.102,103
Because NK cells can kill normal missing-self targets and respond to target cells expressing foreign MHC class I alleles, NK cell alloreactivity can be beneficially utilized for HSCT. A prerequisite for NK cell alloreactivity is that the recipient must lack one or more KIR ligands present in the donor; thus, the recipient's MHC class I allele must not match the KIR of donor-derived NK cells. Taking advantage of NK cell alloreactivity, allogeneic NK cells can be used in combination with HSCT to suppress GVHD and promote graft-versus-leukemia effect. Allogeneic NK cells from a HLA-mismatched donor can decrease GVHD by killing the recipient antigen-presenting cells (for example, dendritic cells) that may otherwise initiate GVHD and produce the graft-versus-leukemia effect by killing residual cancer cells in the recipient. Furthermore, allogeneic NK cells can directly kill the recipient's T cells, leading to improved engraftment.

Velardi's group93 initially demonstrated that donor-versusrecipient NK cell alloactivity could prevent leukemia relapse in AML patients without increasing the risk of GVHD in haploidentical HSCT. It has also been shown that the infusion of allogeneic KIR ligand-mismatched NK cells improved the survival rate and reduced the relapse rate for haploidentical HSCT in AML patients.93,104 Other studies have confirmed a beneficial effect of a KIR-ligand mismatch on the relapse rate and the survival of the recipient.105,106 Although allogeneic NK cell products have been optimized for T-cell depletion and NK cell expansion,107 clinical standardized protocols for the production of NK cells are still lacking. Recently, our group developed a protocol for allogeneic NK cell production without T-cell contamination for clinical trials. Using this protocol, allogeneic NK cells derived from HLA-mismatched donors were transferred to AML patients after haploidentical transplantation, resulting in reduced relapse rates and increased survival rates in patients.74,75
Other clinical strategies for NK cell therapy Several other approaches have been developed to enhance the effect of NK cell immunotherapy by selectively blocking or activating NK receptors.108 Blocking CD94/NKG2A or inhibitory KIRs of NK cells might reduce the NK inhibitory signal, leading to enhanced NK activity,109 whereas upregulating the expression of activating receptors, such as NKG2D on NK cells, or their ligands (ULBPs and MICA/B) on tumor cells, could increase the NK activating signal.110 Histone deacetylase inhibitors111,112 and heat shock 90 inhibitors113 have been shown to upregulate the expression of NKG2D ligands, MICA and MICB on the tumor cells, thereby rendering tumor cells more susceptible to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Treatment of drugs such as melphalan, etoposide and doxorubicin that induce DNA damage responses also increased the susceptibility of myeloma cells to NK cells by upregulating the NK activating ligands, DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM-1) ligand and NKG2D ligand.113 Antibodies that block inhibitory receptors can be used to mimic the missing self-environment and augment NK cell-mediated killing. Recently, a human monoclonal antibody, 1-7F9, that prevents signaling via KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 was developed to increase NK cellmediated cytotoxicity against tumors expressing HLA-C.114,115 In addition, bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, has been shown to increase NK function by reducing the expression of MHC class I on the surface of myeloma cells.116
NK cell effector functions can also be mediated by antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity.117 Because NK cells execute antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity through the CD16 (FCRIII) receptor on their surface, treatment with an antibody can trigger effector functions of NK cells against tumor targets. For example, in CD20+ lymphoma, the administration of the CD20 antibody rituximab induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity to antibody-coated target cells via binding to the CD16 receptor on the surface of NK cells.118,119 Similarly, bispecific antibodies for CD16 on NK cells and for

Figure 3 From hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to clinical application. Natural killer (NK) cells are differentiated from HSCs. For efficient NK cell therapy, each step of NK cell preparation is important. NK cell differentiation, activation and genetically modified NK cells (chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK) are major strategies for the generation of potent NK cell therapy.

CD30 on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma promoted NK cell recognition and cytolysis of tumor cells.120
Genetic engineering of NK cells may also become important in manipulating and enhancing their therapeutic potential. Because T cells can successfully be genetically engineered to express a CAR for CD19, similar strategies have been developed for NK cells. NK cells transduced with a disialoganglioside GD2-recognizing CAR have been applied to enhance cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma.121 Engineering NK cells with CARs specific for CD19 or for CD20 has also been proposed as treatment for leukemias and lymphomas, respectively.54,122
CONCLUSION NK cells have diverse functions in regulating the innate and adaptive immune responses. These properties are derived from the molecular characteristics of NK cells. They express several different surface receptors that can recognize target cells that have appropriate ligands on their surface. In addition, NK cells can secrete cytokines and soluble factors to regulate other immune cells, such as T cells and dendritic cells.
These functional properties make NK cells applicable for clinical treatment, with several groups achieving limited success. To explore NK cell therapy more effectively, we need to understand NK cell biology and function in detail. NK cells are differentiated from HSCs. At each of the steps in NK cell differentiation, activation and genetic modification (for example, CAR-NK cells) may serve as a critical target for successful clinical applications (Figure 3). In the preparation of NK cells, NK cells must be properly activated, and NK cell subsets should be manipulated depending on the type of disease: NK cells with more cytolytic activity are required for the treatment of cancer, whereas NK cells that secrete interferons will be beneficial for the treatment of viral infections.
Several other issues should be considered for the development of successful NK cell-based immunotherapy. Among them is NK cell preparation, which includes the purity and expansion of NK cells, and the criteria for donor selection (KIR genotypes and alloreactive subset sizes). The optimal doses and timing of administration of NK cells should also be determined. Additional factors for consideration include the optimization of conditioning recipients, enhancement of NK cell function and tumor cell susceptibility.
NK cell therapy can be combined with other immunotherapies, including cytotoxic T lymphocyte therapy and antibody therapy. Understanding NK cell properties and functions will

extend its field of application and enhance its availability to fight diseases in the future.

Abstract Background: Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare neurodegenerative disease that presents with progressive psychological, cognitive and motor impairment. These diverse symptoms place a high burden on the patient, families and the healthcare systems they rely on. This study aimed to describe the epidemiology and clinical burden in individuals with HD compared with controls from the general population. Methods: This cohort study utilised data from general practitioner medical records to estimate the prevalence and incidence of HD between January 2000 and December 2018. A cohort of incident HD cases were matched 1:3 to controls from the general population, in whom common clinical diagnoses, medications and healthcare interventions were compared at the time of first recorded diagnosis and at a time close to death. Incidence rates of common diagnoses and mortality were compared with matched controls in the time following HD diagnosis. Results: Prevalence of HD increased between 2000 and 2018, whilst incidence remained stable. Prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses and symptomatic treatments were higher in HD cases than controls. A higher relative risk of psychotic disorders, depression, insomnia, dementia, weight loss, pneumonia and falls was observed in HD cases. Risk of death was >4 times higher in HD, with a median survival of ~12years from first recorded diagnosis. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the significant and progressive clinical burden in individuals with HD up to 18years after first recorded diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION
Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare, genetic neurodegenerative disease that typically affects people in mid-­life and is ultimately fatal [1, 2]. HD is characterised by cognitive, behavioural and motor symptoms that contribute to functional decline, including the ability to walk, talk

and self-­feed [3, 4]. Cognitive and behavioural manifestations such as depression, apathy and irritability can occur years before diagnosis of motor onset and deteriorate steadily as the disease progresses [5-­7]. Motor symptoms are initially subtle and gradually worsen over time, typically including chorea, dystonia, abnormal gait and balance, difficulty with speech and swallowing, and bradykinesia [4].

Furby et al.

The estimated prevalence of HD varies globally and appears to have increased in the years since predictive testing became available. In a study of HD epidemiology in the UK, Evans et al. reported that the prevalence of HD doubled between 1990 and 2010 [8], although incidence seemingly appears constant at 7.2 new cases (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.5-­7.9) per million person-­years (PY) [9]. While the reason for increasing prevalence is unclear, the heavy burden that the disease places on individuals with HD and their families warrants efforts to better understand the epidemiology of the disease and the associated clinical burden it places on individuals and public health systems.
In this population-­based study, we describe the epidemiology and clinical disease burden associated with HD over an 18-­year study period using linked UK electronic medical records. This study reports the incidence, prevalence and mortality of HD in the UK, describes the clinical profile of patients at two time points (at first recorded diagnosis and close to death) and provides incidence rates of relevant clinical diagnoses, medications and healthcare interventions compared with a matched cohort from the general population.
METHODS
Study population
HD cases were defined as those with 1 Read code indicative of a diagnosis of HD (F134.00 Huntington's chorea; Eu02200 Dementia in HD) as defined previously [8, 9]. Individuals were aged 18years at the time of first recorded HD diagnosis (HD index) and had 1 day of eligible data during the study period. Free text associated with the HD diagnosis code was reviewed to ensure that diagnosis codes with reference to a patient without HD or with a family history of HD were not included.
An overall UK-­wide HD cohort was used for estimating prevalence and incidence of HD. Prevalent individuals were those with a diagnosis of HD any time prior to, or during, the study period (2000-­ 2018), whilst incident individuals were those who had their first recorded diagnosis of HD during the study period, without a prior record of HD. A minimum 1 year of continuous enrolment, free from HD diagnosis, was required to limit the likelihood of a prevalent individual being defined as part of the incident cohort.
For the comparative analysis, a restricted cohort of incident individuals with HD was defined, who were also eligible for linkage to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) death registry and 2015 small area-­level English Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) (a deprivation score assigned to each general practitioner (GP) according to multiple domains such as income, employment, education and crime within the GP postcode) [10]. HD cases were matched to a control group from the general Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) population who did not have any recorded codes indicative of HD, but who had eligible data for research at the time of HD index of the equivalent case individuals. Controls were matched 3:1 (sex, year of birth, socio-­economic status [IMD] and practice location) to HD

cases. Since the English IMD was used, the comparative analysis was restricted to individuals registered at GP practices in England.
Study design
This was a cohort study that took place between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2018. Annual prevalence and incidence of HD were first described in the overall HD cohort. Prevalence of clinical diagnoses, medications and healthcare interventions of interest were described in the restricted cohort of incident HD cases and matched controls at two equivalent time points: (1) at the time of HD index (i.e., the date of first recorded diagnosis) and (2) 3 months prior to death (i.e., a proxy for more advanced disease). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated to explore relative rates of clinical diagnosis in HD cases and controls in the years after index. Survival time and risk of death were compared in HD cases and controls and underlying cause of death described.
Data sources
The CPRD-­GOLD captures primary care data from anonymised GPs across the UK. With coverage of ~7% of the UK population, it is thought to be broadly representative of the UK general population in terms of age, sex and ethnicity [11].
For the comparative analysis, data were linked to the ONS death register which captures complete death recordings of all individuals in England and Wales, including occurrence, date and cause of death. Data were also linked to small area-­level English IMD as a composite measure of socio-­demographic deprivation. More information on linkage of CPRD data can be found here: https://cprd.com/linke d-­data.
Statistical methods
Prevalence of HD
Overall prevalence of adult HD (18years) was reported as the number of cases of HD per 100,000 people (±95% CI) across the entire study period. Annual prevalence was calculated (cases of HD per 100,000 people and 95% CI for each calendar year between 2000 and 2018). Results were stratified by age group, sex and geographical location (across the UK). A linear regression model was fitted to examine whether the trend was statistically significant over time.
Annual incidence of HD
Annual incidence (newly diagnosed cases of HD per 100,000 PY and 95% CI for each calendar year between 2000 and 2018) was calculated as the total number of adults in the UK whose first HD record

BURDEN OF HD IN THE UK
occurred during eligible data in each given calendar year, divided by the total person time of individuals in the at-­risk population (i.e., no previous diagnosis of HD) and eligible for 1 day during that year. Trends were assessed via linear regression analysis.
Disease burden in incident HD cases versus matched controls
Demographics
Demographics including age, sex, IMD, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), CCI comorbidities, marital status, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol consumption status, weight and geographical region were described for the overall (UK) and restricted (England only) matched cohorts. Characteristics were assessed by looking back up to 1 year before HD index. Demographics in the matched controls were described at an equivalent time point to the respective matched case or using the closest available data. Group comparisons were conducted with t-­test/Mann-­Whitney U test for continuous variables and Chi-­squared/Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, as appropriate.
Prevalence of clinical diagnoses, medications and interventions of HD in England
Code lists were compiled for specified clinical diagnoses, medications and interventions of relevance to individuals with HD defined a priori following literature assessment and clinical input (see Code list in Appendix S2). A look-­back period of 1 year was used to capture diagnosis codes on or before each time point of interest. The percentage of individuals who experienced a clinical event during this look-­back window was reported. To compare HD cases with controls, crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were obtained via inverse probability of treatment-­weighted generalised linear models, adjusting for age, gender, region, BMI, smoking status, alcohol status, socio-­economic status (IMD), and CCI. P values and CIs were calculated via non-­parametric bootstrapping and corrected with the Benjamini-­Hochberg method for multiple comparisons.
Incidence of clinical diagnoses of HD in England
Incidence of clinical diagnoses following index was calculated per 1000 PY (95% CI). The number of individuals who experienced their first record of an event during the study period was divided by the total number of years in which individuals were at risk of experiencing the event. Person time was calculated up until the first event, death, end of eligible data or end of the study period, whichever came first. Crude IRRs and p values were reported to compare incidence in HD cases with controls, with Benjamini-­Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons.

Mortality
The Kaplan-­Meier (KM) method was used to estimate the unadjusted survival times for incident HD and matched controls, from HD index date (or equivalent in controls) until death or end of the study period, whichever came first. Median survival time (95% CI) was calculated. Date of death was defined as the earliest date recorded in CPRD or ONS, to avoid overestimation of survival rates. Those that were lost to follow-­up in CPRD were assumed to be alive for the duration of the study period unless a death date was seen in the ONS death registry. Hazard ratios, reflective of risk of death in HD versus controls, were calculated via Cox proportional hazards regression method with adjustment for a priori baseline covariates including age, sex, IMD, CCI, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI and geographical region at index. Primary underlying and mentioned cause of death (International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision [ICD-­10] codes) were described for cases and controls independently.

Prevalence and incidence of HD in the UK
Overall, 881 prevalent cases of HD were ascertained during the study period, from a total population of 10,757,951 persons (Table 1). Prevalence of HD per 100,000 people (95% CI) was 8.2 cases (7.7-­ 8.8) and was highest in those aged 55-­64years (N = 1211, 10.3 cases [9.7-­10.9]) (Table S1). Highest prevalence was reported in Scotland (N = 173, 11.2 cases [9.7-­13.0]) and lowest in London (N = 38, 3.1 cases [2.2-­4.2]) (Table S2). Prevalence was similar in males (N = 414, 8.0 cases [7.3-­8.8]) and females (N = 462, 8.3 cases [7.6-­9.1]).
Annual prevalence steadily increased throughout the study period, with prevalence estimates ranging from 4.3 cases (3.6-­5.1) per 100,000 in 2000 to 9.2 cases (8.1-­10.5) per 100,000 people in 2018 ( = 0.27, p <0.001).
There were 586 incident cases of HD from a total at-­risk population of 10,756,901 persons (corresponding to 80,048,926 PY) during the study period (Table 1). There was no evidence that incidence increased over time ( = 0.004, p = 0.4), with 16-­44 newly diagnosed cases per year identified. In 2018, incidence of HD was 0.8 (0.5-­1.19) per 100,000 PY.
Demographics
Of the overall incident HD population in the UK (N = 586), 54% were female. The median age at first recorded diagnosis was 54years (interquartile range [IQR] 44-­66) and the majority (44.9%) of individuals were aged 45-­64years at the time of HD index. Of these, 264 patients with HD were eligible for inclusion in the matched comparative analysis. Gender (50% male) and age distribution were similar to their overall cohort and exactly matched to non-­HD controls (Tables 2 and S3).

Prevalence of clinical diagnoses
At HD index, depression (9% vs. 3%, 4.34, 1.90-­8.68, p <0.001), falls (6% vs. 2%, 2.19, 0.79-­5.09, p = 0.09) and fractures/breaks/ sprains (5% vs. 2%, 2.5, 0.83-­5.96, p = 0.09) were more prevalent in HD cases than controls; only depression exceeded p <0.05 after model adjustment. Controls were more prevalent than individuals with HD for hypertension (6% vs. 11%, 0.43, 0.23-­0.89, p <0.05) and diabetes (4% vs. 7%, 0.39, 1.9-­8.68, p <0.05) (%, ORadj, 95% CI) (Table S4).
Three months before death, anxiety (11% vs. 5%, 2.11, 0.7-­ 5.6, p = 0.15), depression (28% vs. 6%, 4.28, 1.72-­8.67, p <0.001), falls (25% vs. 8%, 2.5, 1.18-­4.73, p <0.05), insomnia (25% vs. 4%, 8.82, 3.62-­20.19, p <0.001) and fractures/breaks/sprains (20% vs. 10%, 1.83, 0.85-­3.35, p = 0.09) were more prevalent in HD cases. Cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in controls than in individuals with HD (48% vs. 27%, 0.49, 0.29-­0.79, p <0.01) (%, ORadj, 95% CI) (Table S4).

Incidence of other clinical diagnoses in HD cases versus controls
Incidence rates of the following were statistically higher in individuals with HD than controls: psychotic disorders, psychosis, insomnia, dementia, depression, pneumonia, weight loss and falls. Incidence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes was higher in matched controls. Cases per 1000 PY, IRR, 95% CI and p values are shown in Table 3. Data summarising the number of individuals at risk and person time used to calculate IRRs can be found in Table S5.
Prevalence of healthcare interventions
At HD index, homecare/domestic visits (9% vs. 3%, 2.64, 1.24-­ 5.29) and physiotherapy (6% vs. 3%, 1.38, 0.55-­2.90) were more prevalent in the HD cohort (%, ORadj, 95% CI). After model adjustment, homecare/domestic visits were more than twice as

prevalent in individuals with HD than controls (ORadj =2.64, p = 0.03) (Table S6).
Three months before death, individuals with HD generally received more interventions than controls; however, in most cases the number of records was not powered to perform significance testing. Homecare and domestic visits were >4 times more prevalent in individuals with HD at the time point 3 months prior to death compared with controls (ORadj =4.39, p <0.001).
Molecular pathology procedures (including coded interactions with geneticists and genetic counselling) were more common in individuals with HD than controls at index (11% vs. 0%) and close to death (14% vs. 0%). Statistical modelling was not conducted due to zero events in the control cohort (Table S6).
Prevalence of medication records
At index, antipsychotics (11% vs. 3%, 3.71, 1.70-­6.83), antidepressants (33% vs. 14%, 3.04, 2.04-­4.53), sleep medication (19% vs. 7%, 3.01, 1.75-­4.99) and diazepam (9% vs. 3%, 2.79, 1.29-­5.81) were more common in individuals with HD compared with controls (%, ORadj, 95% CI).
Three months before death, antipsychotics (58% vs. 11%, 7.08, 3.88-­12.00), sleep medications (53% vs. 19%, 3.71, 2.23-­5.70), antidepressants (63% vs. 22%, 3.38, 2.12-­5.33) and diazepam (24% vs. 9%, 2.62, 1.18-­4.81) were higher in HD after model adjustment use of the following medications (%, ORadj, 95% CI).
Tetrabenazine was higher than controls at HD index (6% vs. 0%) and close to death (39% vs. 0%) but was not modelled (Table S7).
Mortality
Of the incident cohort, 106 HD cases (40%) and 114 controls (14%) died during the study period. The KM survival curve (Figure 1) shows a median survival time of 12.4years (95% CI 10.6-­15.2). Median age at death in individuals with HD and controls was 71 (IQR 59-­79) and 81 (IQR 73-­86) years, respectively. Individuals with HD were at 4.5 times greater risk of death than controls (hazard ratio 4.51, 95% CI 3.36-­6.06, p <0.001) after multivariable adjustment of baseline covariates (Figure S1).
The most common underlying cause of death in the HD cohort was HD (n = 62; 59.6%). The most commonly mentioned causes of death (any mention) were HD (78.3%), bronchopneumonia (unspecified) (15.9%), pneumonitis due to food and vomiting (10.4%), unspecified dementia (6.6%) and sepsis (6.6%) (Table S8).
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to explore the burden of HD in UK electronic medical records and provides updated epidemiological estimates on

the prevalence, incidence and mortality of HD in the UK/England. In addition to expanding upon prior observations, our study uniquely introduces a control comparator arm which is absent in many population-­based studies.
Overall, 881 prevalent and 586 incident cases of HD were identified in the UK CPRD-­GOLD database between 2000 and 2018. A strength of the CPRD database compared with patient registries such as Enroll-­HD (NCT01574053) is that it includes all individuals seen by GPs in the UK, not just those participating in long-­term clinical trials where they are seen by HD specialists. Prevalence doubled from 4.3 cases per 100,000 in 2000 to 9.2 cases per 100,000 in 2018. These figures align with a global systematic review [12] and when considering studies only conducted in the UK, our results fall within the range (5.96-­12.3 cases per 100,000 people) of those reported previously [8, 13]. Increased prevalence was not explained by an increased incidence of HD, whereby our findings corroborate prior evidence that incidence of HD in the UK does not increase steadily over time [9]. Increasing life expectancy of the UK general population or better symptomatic treatments that prolong longevity in individuals with HD may explain the increased prevalence observed. The UK is known for its active clinical research in the field of HD which may contribute to a higher case ascertainment compared with other European countries, rather than a difference in the underlying epidemiology across European countries.
Global variation in HD prevalence is partly explained by the average cytosine adenine guanine (CAG) repeat lengths and frequency of different huntingtin gene haplotypes across individuals. For example, prevalence is 10-­100 times lower in East Asian populations [12, 14] whose HD chromosomes are typically found on haplotype C, compared with Western European populations who

are typically haplotype A. Genetic factors that may influence prevalence could not be accounted for in this study since genetic data are not available in CPRD. Prevalence varied across the UK, with the highest prevalence in Scotland, which may be attributed to better case ascertainment due to higher underlying genetic susceptibility in the ancestral populations, increased disease awareness and education, and access to world-­leading specialist HD care. Lower prevalence in London may be attributed to the higher cost of living and the high population density which would decrease the numerators and denominators, respectively, leading to a lower net prevalence in the capital.
Median age of first recorded diagnosis was 54 and 56years in the UK-­wide cohort and incident-­matched cohort, respectively, which was higher than the age of motor symptom onset typically reported in the literature [3, 15]. Identifying the exact point at which a patient is diagnosed with manifest HD can be hard to determine in regular healthcare settings. It may be that GP reporting of HD diagnosis may be delayed, since a clinical diagnosis itself is commonly given in a specialist neurology setting prior to informing the GP. Conversely, some patients, particularly in rural populations, may not be known to specialists, and GPs may manage the diagnosis and management of disease in the early stages. Since the GP acts as the gatekeeper to NHS specialist services, we consider the first GP-­recorded diagnosis as a useful index definition for public health planning.
A later primary care diagnosis may also contribute to the shorter survival time (~12years) observed in our study compared with other global studies, which report survival of 15-­25years [16-­20]. This may be partly attributed to index definition (e.g., first recorded diagnosis vs. motor symptom onset) and/or the methods used. For example, a retrospective chart review by Roos et al. [18] reported a median survival time of 16.2years; however, onset of choreatic movements

Strata

(aged 40±12years) was used to define index in this study, and data from this specialist centre have biased findings towards earlier detection and longer life expectancy due to better specialist management. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report HD-­related mortality in the UK; using this robust death registry and our findings demonstrate a ~4 times increased risk of death compared with the general population. The most common underlying cause of death was HD, demonstrating the fatal effects of HD, although unfortunately the immediate cause of death, such as pneumonia, infections or suicide [17], which may be useful for treating professionals, was not captured.
Our findings describe a picture of high psychiatric burden in individuals with HD compared with the general population, including a higher incidence rate of psychosis, depression and sleep disturbances after diagnosis. In line with other reports, it was noted that depression is the most prevalent clinical diagnosis associated with HD [21]. The high rate of sleep disturbances in those closer to death reflects the progressive disruption in circadian rhythms which is a progressive phenotype of HD [22]. Beyond the psychiatric symptoms of HD, we also report on the rate of other physical comorbidities, including higher prevalence of falls. Increased falls are often one of the earliest signs of HD, preceding a clinical diagnosis of HD, and are explained by loss of muscle control and gait disturbances typical of HD, which occur more frequently as the disease progresses.
Not all comorbidities were higher in HD, for example, diabetes and hypertension were lower in individuals with HD than controls at the time of diagnosis. A study using data from the Enroll-­HD

database attributed lower prevalence of hypertension to antihypertensive medication use, although the causal relationship is not clear [23]. Both diabetes and hypertension are well-­established risk factors for cardiovascular disease, which might explain the lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease in individuals with HD than matched controls at the later time point.
There are no disease-­modifying treatments currently available for HD. Symptomatic treatments may influence survival, for instance by reducing suicidality or improving mobility. We found that the odds of taking antidepressants, diazepam and other sleep medications were up to four times higher in HD and use of antipsychotics was up to eight times higher. Together these findings are in line with the incidence of psychiatric and motor diagnoses reported in this cohort and demonstrate the importance of these symptomatic therapies in standard clinical care. Our findings also describe increased homecare/domestic visits in patients with HD, particularly those closer to death, thereby demonstrating the increasing burden on the UK healthcare system, particularly later in the disease course.
Limitations
CPRD only captures clinical diagnoses recorded by primary care physicians and therefore diagnoses and drugs/interventions given in a hospital setting are not captured. This may be particularly important for understanding more progressed patients. Unlike registry studies like Enroll-­HD, data on the causative CAG repeat expansion and

| 2256

established Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (Huntington Study Group, 1996) [24] are not captured in CPRD. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility of misclassification (e.g., where pre-­ manifest HD gene carriers were falsely coded as manifest HD gene carriers after receiving a positive genetic test) and/or miscoding errors, since the quality of case ascertainment depends on multiple factors including whether the team enters them, the clinician's IT skills, time, certainty of diagnosis, how important they believe coding is, and organisational issues [25]. A proxy for late-­stage disease was used here to demonstrate increased burden at more advanced stages; however, alternative ways of staging HD in routine clinical care data warrant investigation.
CONCLUSIONS
Prevalence of HD continued to increase throughout the UK, though not because of increased incidence, which remained stable throughout the study period. Median survival from first GP record to death was 12.4years. Psychiatric burden was higher in individuals with HD compared with controls and increased in those closer to death. Incidence rates of psychotic disorders, insomnia, dementia, depression, pneumonia, weight loss and falls were also higher in individuals with HD, whilst incidence rates of cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes were higher in matched controls. This study provides updated epidemiological estimates on the prevalence and incidence of, and mortality in, HD, which together, increase our understanding of the physical, psychiatric and public health burden of HD.

Association between Cardiac Autonomic Neuropathy, Diabetic Retinopathy and Carotid Atherosclerosis in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (Endocrinol Metab 2013;28:309-19, Chan-Hee Jung et al.)

Carotid atherosclerosis, carotid autonomic neuropathy (CAN) and ischemic heart diseases are important issues in the clinical management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Since these cardiac problems are closely related to mortality [1], clinicians are eager to expand their knowledge in terms of the prevention of atherosclerosis and early detection of CAN. Jung et al. [2] demonstrated the association between the presence of CAN and carotid atherosclerosis presenting as carotie intima-media thickness and carotid plaque, and suggested that CAN may be an important determinant of subclinical atherosclerosis, which is a possible explanation for the excess cardiovascular mortality observed in patients with T2DM.  Before expand the meaning of this study, however, I'd like to think over the significance of CAN evaluation process. In this study, the authors used the CAN scoring system, which is the sum of the score of five CAN tests. The presence of CAN was defined as the presence of two or more abnormal tests or an autonomic neuropathy score 2. Although it is a relatively simple method, I wonder whether these scoring systems can reflect a patient's exact CAN status. The result of each test may have different diagnostic power of atherosclerotic disease. Furthermore, the definition of two abnormal tests in-

cludes many potential combinations of different abnormal CAN tests. Since each of the five CAN test has a different meaning, each of these different combinations could also have unique clinical implications. Thus, it should again be questioned whether this definition of the presence of CAN is fully acceptable. Can we accept as "no evidence of CAN" cases with one abnormal test result? Is a 2 CAN score too high for early detection of atherosclerotic conditions? Further studies are needed to verify these arbitrary diagnostic criteria.  Assessment of CAN is rarely accepted as first line studies in newly diagnosed patients with T2DM [3], mainly because of the cost and time requirements of CAN evaluation. Thus, further studies are needed for the development of easier, more cost-effective methods of CAN evaluation and to confirm its clinical significance, in order to expand the screening process for this important diabetic complication.

Background: The identification of a marker for hypoglycemia could help patients achieve strict glucose control with a lower risk of hypoglycemia. 1,5-Anhydro-D-glucitol (1,5-AG) reflects postprandial hyperglycemia in patients with well-controlled diabetes, which contributes to glycemic variability. Because glycemic variability is related to hypoglycemia, we aimed to evaluate the value of 1,5-AG as a marker of hypoglycemia. Methods: We enrolled 18 adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving insulin therapy and assessed the occurrence of hypoglycemia within a 3-month period. We measured 1,5-AG level, performed a survey to score the severity of hypoglycemia, and applied a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). Results: 1,5-AG was significantly lower in the high hypoglycemia-score group compared to the low-score group. Additionally, the duration of insulin treatment was significantly longer in the high-score group. Subsequent analyses were adjusted by the duration of insulin treatment and mean blood glucose, which was closely associated with both 1,5-AG level and hypoglycemia risk. In adjusted correlation analyses, 1,5-AG was negatively correlated with hypoglycemia score, area under the curve at 80 mg/dL, and low blood glucose index during CGMS (P=0.068, P=0.033, and P=0.060, respectively). Conclusion: 1,5-AG level was negatively associated with hypoglycemia score determined by recall and with documented hypoglycemia after adjusting for mean glucose and duration of insulin treatment. As a result, this level could be a marker of the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with well-controlled T2DM receiving insulin therapy.

INTRODUCTION
Strict glycemic control is important to prevent the microvascular complications of diabetes [1,2]. However, the risk of hypoglycemia precludes such intensive management. Hypoglycemia can increase mortality in some patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [3,4] and likely has an impact on diabetes-related cognitive decline and related brain deficits [5]. Even non-

severe hypoglycemic episodes can decrease a patient's quality of life and increase the anxiety and fear of hypoglycemia. It has been reported that the prevalence of hypoglycemia was approximately 12% to 30% depending on the treatment strategy in patients with T2DM patients in the United States [6]. In Korea, the number of patients with severe hypoglycemia seems to be increasing [7], and one center reported that the incidence of patients with severe hypoglycemia requiring intervention was

about 12.6% during a median 10.4 years of follow-up [8]. Identifying a marker of hypoglycemia risk could help pa-
tients achieve strict glucose control with a lower risk of hypoglycemia. Although there are several clinical characteristics associated with severe hypoglycemia, there is not a simple marker of mild hypoglycemia. Because repetitive episodes of hypoglycemia can cause severe hypoglycemia [9,10], the prevention of mild hypoglycemia is also important.
1,5-Anhydro-D-glucitol (1,5-AG), 1-deoxy form of glucose is a circulating polyol in body fluid. 1,5-AG is mainly supplied by oral ingestion of natural foods and is evenly distributed to all tissues and organs. 1,5-AG level is kept at a constant level in healthy people through a balance of intake and excretion. The mean 1,5-AG level in Japanese patients with normal glucose tolerance has been reported to be 24.7±7.5 µg/mL [11]. Because 1,5-AG has a similar structure to glucose, its reabsorption is competitively inhibited by glucose in the renal tubule [12]. Therefore, blood 1,5-AG level decreases during hyperglycemia, when high glucose level exists in the renal tubule, reflecting the mean glucose level within a 1- to 2-week-period [13]. Although 1,5-AG is negatively correlated with mean blood glucose (MBG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in patients with T2DM [14], the range of 1,5-AG has been observed to be very wide, even in patients with similar HbA1c values. This trend can be explained by the finding that 1,5-AG also reflects postprandial hyperglycemia as well, which is not the case for HbA1c [14,15]. In T2DM, postprandial hyperglycemia contributes to glycemic variability, which is one of the risk factors of hypoglycemia [16], along with aging, renal insufficiency, progressive insulin deficiency, treatment modalities such as insulin or long-acting sulfonylureas, and duration of diabetes and insulin treatment [17,18]. Therefore, as a marker of postprandial hyperglycemia, 1,5-AG could reflect the burden of hypoglycemia in patients with well-controlled T2DM.
In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of 1,5-AG as a marker of hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM receiving insulin therapy.

level less than 80 mg/dL within a 3-month period. Exclusion criteria included serum creatinine higher than 1.5 mg/dL or elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels more than three times the upper range of normal. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB No. 1308054-512). Informed consent was obtained from all of the participants. All study procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Questionnaire and measurements The participants were asked to complete Clarke's hypoglycemia questionnaire [19] with a modified scoring system for patients with T2DM (Fig. 1) because it had originally been developed for patients with type 1 diabetes. The possible range of scores was 2 to 46 points, with points assigned to each item based on severity. The score subjectively indicated the severity of hypoglycemia depending on patient recollection. We also obtained the patients' demographic and anthropometric data, while medical history including duration of diabetes, medications, and diabetic complications was obtained by a trained nurse. Fasting serum 1,5-AG, glucose, C-peptide, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, total bilirubin, AST, ALT, creatinine, and random urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio were measured in all participants.
Continuous glucose monitoring system in the participants The participants also underwent glucose monitoring with the

Meditronic MiniMed (Meditronic, Northridge, CA, USA) continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) System Gold. CGMS recorded interstitial glucose level every 5 minutes for 72 consecutive hours, and the CGMS data were analyzed using MiniMed Solutions software [14]. From the CGMS data, we determined the degree of hypoglycemia as the area under the curve at 80 mg/dL (AUC80) [20]. Glucose variability indices were calculated with EasyGV software, a web-based application (www.easygv.co.uk) [21], and included the standard deviation of blood glucose value (standard deviation [SD]), weighted average of glucose values at 100 mg/dL (M100), percentage coefficient of variation (%CV), mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE), J-index, low blood glucose index (LBGI), high blood glucose index (HBGI), glycemic risk assessment in diabetes equation (GRADE), and continuous overall net glycemic action (CONGA). M100 indicates a measure of stability of

the glucose level in comparison with 100 mg/dL, while %CV is the ratio of SD to average glucose level. MAGE is calculated based on the mean of the differences between consecutive peaks and nadirs, which were greater than one SD of mean glucose level. J-index is a measure of the quality of glycemic control based on the mean and SD [22]. The LBGI and the HBGI were specifically designed to be sensitive to hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, respectively [23]. GRADE indicates the risk attribution of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia [24]. CONGA is the SD of the differences in glucose level within a predetermined time window intervals [22].
Statistical analysis Statistical analysis and data management were performed using IBM SPSS version 21.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA) or GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). All data are

The Pearson correlation coefficient and partial correlation coefficient were used for correlation analysis (Table 3, Fig. 2). The hypoglycemia score and 1,5-AG level were transformed logarithmically in some analyses. Statistical significance was determined at P<0.05.
RESULTS
Clinical characteristics of the participants A total of 18 participants were enrolled, and their clinical char-

acteristics are shown in Table 1. Men made up 61.1% of the participants. The mean age was 65.2±9.6 years, HbA1c was 7.6±0.9%, hypoglycemia score was 9.9±5.0, and 1,5-AG level was 6.4±2.5 g/mL. According to the CGMS data, the mean glucose level was 187.3±44.6 mg/dL, MAGE was 140.3± 59.6 mg/dL, and AUC80 was 0.44±0.86 mg/dL·day. During the 72-hour CGMS period, five participants did not achieve a glucose level less than 80 mg/dL, and another five participants reached a glucose level less than 80 mg/dL only for an average of 21 minutes (0.49% of the CGMS period). Therefore, we could only observe significant hypoglycemia in eight of the 18 participants. Comparisons according to sex revealed no signifi-

hypoglycemia score (Table 2) and found that duration of insulin treatment and serum 1,5-AG level were significantly different between the groups, while insulin dose, fasting blood glucose, and HbA1c level were not different. Hypoglycemia can be influenced by factors such as age, duration of diabetes, renal impairment, and treatment modality [16,18], but these were comparable between the groups. However, neither glycemic variability nor AUC80 was significantly different between the groups.
Significant correlations between 1,5-AG level and hypoglycemia indices When we performed correlation analysis between 1,5-AG and hypoglycemia score, there was a significant negative relationship (r=-0.510, P=0.031) (Fig. 2A). After adjusting for duration of insulin treatment and mean glucose, the negative correlation remained (r=-0.468, P=0.068).
In cases of hypoglycemia as determined by CGMS data, AUC80 was not associated with 1,5-AG level in simple correlation analysis. However, adjusting for duration of insulin treatment and mean glucose revealed a significant correlation between 1,5-AG and AUC80 (r=-0.533, P=0.033) (Fig. 2B).

AG and the calculations from CGMS (Table 3). In the simple correlation analyses, 1,5-AG showed negative correlations with most indices (P=0.011 to 0.071) except LBGI. However, MBG influences not only 1,5-AG level [12-14], but several indices of glycemic variability [22]. Therefore, adjusting for MBG and duration of insulin treatment revealed an association between 1,5-AG and LBGI (P=0.060), strengthened the association between 1,5-AG and GRADE (P=0.009), and negated the significant correlations between 1,5-AG and the other variables.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we evaluated whether 1,5-AG level could act as a simple marker of hypoglycemia in patients with well-controlled T2DM receiving insulin therapy. As we showed in this study (Table 3), 1,5-AG level is known to have a negative correlation with postprandial hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM with a HbA1c less than 8% [14,15], which indicates significantly increased glycemic variability. On the other hand, 1,5-AG is also negatively correlated with short-term MBG (Table 3) [12-14]. Both severe glycemic variability due to postprandial hyperglycemia and low MBG, which affect 1,5-AG level in opposing directions, enhance hypoglycemia [16,25]. Therefore, it is unclear whether 1,5-AG actually reflects hypoglycemia. Even if 1,5-AG does reflect hypoglycemia, its clinical utility is uncertain. One study has demonstrated that patients with high 1,5-AG level were associated with a smaller risk of hypoglycemia even with multiple insulin injection therapy compared to patients receiving conventional insulin therapy [26]. The study did not evaluate a direct relationship between risk of hypoglycemia and 1,5-AG level. As a result, we limited study participants to patients with well-controlled T2DM under insulin treatment and found that 1,5-AG level was negatively associated with hypoglycemia risk when the level was adjusted for mean glucose and duration of insulin treatment (Fig. 2).
We enrolled 18 patients who had experienced recent hypoglycemia; however, CGMS revealed episodes with glucose level less than 80 mg/dL in only 13 participants; the reasons for this discrepancy are presumed to be due to the delay in performing CGMS from the time of symptoms. Because the questionnaire was administered right after enrollment, the patients might have been more cautious with their insulin doses, thus reducing their risk of hypoglycemia. This discrepancy could have contributed to the lack of difference in AUC80 between

the high-score and low-score groups (Table 2). Indeed, there is a possibility that the scores were inaccurate because they were mainly dependent on patient recall. In addition, the participants were patients with T2DM, who might be less adherent to selfmeasurements of blood glucose compared to patients with type 1 diabetes. As a result, hypoglycemic events could have been under-estimated by the scoring system.
We indirectly examined the potential role of 1,5-AG as an index of hypoglycemia by demonstrating the associations between 1,5-AG and two indices of glycemic variability related to hypoglycemia: LBGI and GRADE (Table 3). These indicators reflect the degree of hypoglycemia [23,24], and LBGI has been reported to be a significant predictor of future severe hypoglycemia [27]. Therefore, the negative correlations between 1,5-AG and these indices after adjusting for mean glucose reinforce the possibility that 1,5-AG reflects the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM receiving insulin therapy.
The limitations of this study include the fact that the hypoglycemia scoring system is not a standardized tool used for the study of patients with T2DM. We used the Clarke hypoglycemic questionnaire (Fig. 1), which was developed to assess impaired awareness of hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes [19]. There are no standardized questionnaires for evaluating the severity of hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM, so we modified the scoring system of the Clarke hypoglycemic questionnaire. In addition, we detected hypoglycemia, as defined by glucose level less than 80 mg/dL, in only 3.48% of the total period of CGMS. The relative rarity of hypoglycemia likely weakened the statistical significance in the analyses. As mentioned above, the failure to find a significant difference in AUC80 between the high-score and low-score groups (0.53± 0.76 vs. 0.73±1.18, P=0.742) (Table 2) might be due to the low incidence of hypoglycemia.
During the study period including the 3 months before enrollment, there were no serious episodes of hypoglycemia requiring hospitalization or emergency department admission or situations that required the assistance of another person. However, recurrent hypoglycemia, even if it is mild and easily relievable, is known to be a risk factor of serious hypoglycemia [9,10], which could have detrimental effects on cardiovascular disease and mortality [4,28]. Therefore, in an effort to avoid any episodes of hypoglycemia, intermittent monitoring of 1,5AG might be helpful in patients with T2DM receiving insulin therapy, especially if they have recently experienced symptoms of hypoglycemia. It is difficult to say which cut off point of 1,5-AG could be used as a marker of hypoglycemia, therefore

the validation studies with larger populations would be required to apply 1,5-AG in clinic to prevent hypoglycemia.

Intra-operative imaging in trauma surgery

Holger Keil Nils Beisemann Benedict Swartman Sven Yves Vetter Paul Alfred Grützner Jochen Franke
 The reconstruction of anatomical joint surfaces, limb alignment and rotational orientation are crucial in the treatment of fractures in terms of preservation of function and range of motion. To assess reduction and implant position intra-operatively, mobile C-arms are mandatory to immediately and continuously control these parameters.
 Usually, these devices are operated by OR staff or radiology technicians and assessed by the surgeon who is performing the procedure. Moreover, due to special objectives in the intra-operative setting, the situation cannot be compared with standard radiological image acquisition. Thus, surgeons need to be trained and educated to ensure correct technical conduct and interpretation of radiographs.
 It is essential to know the standard views of the joints and long bones and how to position the patient and C-arm in order to acquire these views. Additionally, the operating field must remain sterile, and the radiation exposure of the patient and staff must be kept as low as possible.
 In some situations, especially when reconstructing complex joint fractures or spinal injuries, complete evaluation of critical aspects of the surgical results is limited in two-dimensional views and fluoroscopy. Intra-operative three-dimensional imaging using special C-arms offers a valuable opportunity to improve intra-operative assessment and thus patient outcome.
 In this article, common fracture situations in trauma surgery as well as special circumstances that the surgeon may encounter are addressed.

Introduction
Dealing with structures that are usually localized deep inside the surrounding soft tissue, trauma and orthopaedic surgery represent a challenge for intra-operative visualization and orientation to the surgeon. In addition to in-depth knowledge of the anatomy and anatomical orientation of structures, additional methods to show the position of instruments and implants and the result of reduction procedures is essential. For more than half a century, intra-operative imaging with mobile C-arms has guided the surgeon in the challenge to achieve a result as close to the original anatomy as possible.
Along with the continuing improvements of implants and surgical techniques with the subsequent diminution of surgical approaches, reduction of soft-tissue dissection and thus less exposure of the bony structures, the demand for performant and high-resolution intra-operative imaging has grown. Without the possibility of real-time visualization of the anatomy of bony structures, as well as the position of instruments and implants in relation to the bone and the ability for evaluating the reconstruction of joint surfaces and bony alignment, the rapid evolution of minimally invasive surgery would not have been possible1,2. Examples include percutaneous placement of pedicle screws in thoracolumbar spine surgery, closed reduction, and tunnelled placement of implants in the treatment of tibial or femoral metaphyseal fractures with specially designed plates or calcaneus osteosyntheses with slit-in plates that reduce the length of the incision to the diameter of the plate3,4.
However, cutting-edge techniques of minimally invasive osteosynthesis are not the only procedures that pose the need for intra-operative imaging. Even in situations where complete clinical access to the surgical view is present, such as in conventional total hip arthroplasty, intraoperative images are performed to confirm correct alignment and orientation of the implant, especially the

acetabular cup, and to rule out accompanying fractures of the acetabular region or the femoral shaft5.
Technology evolves and thus new possibilities have been developed and are available for improving surgery. Intra-operative three-dimensional (3D) imaging with mobile C-arms was introduced in 2001 and has become an important adjunct for reconstruction of complex joint fractures6. Navigation systems that show the position of instruments in real time in a 3D volume can aid in improving precision and allow safe implant placement in the most complex situations7,8.
It is up to the surgeon to carefully use the possibilities technology offers to improve treatment outcomes and the lives of our patients.
Radiation protection
Depending on the place of residence, there is a natural radiation exposure that causes a dose of 2 to 200 mSv per year (in most areas in Europe and the Americas, it is around 2 to 3 mSv). In industrialized countries, the average additional dose due to exposure to ionizing radiation from medical devices causes an equal dose of about 2 mSv9. The doses caused by different diagnostics are shown in Table 1.
C-arms are x-ray machines and thus pose a potential threat to the patient as well as to the staff in the operating room as they emit ionizing radiation12,13. As with all x-raybased diagnostic devices used in medicine, the referring and responsible physicians have to weigh the potential hazard due to the radiation against the benefit that can be drawn by the result of the examination. Usually, doses applied in stationary radiology are higher than in intraoperative settings due to higher energy levels used. Depending on the local situation, the responsible usage of an x-ray device is restricted to specially trained staff. In Germany, medical staff must apply for a special qualification to be allowed to operate devices that emit ionizing radiation or even to supervise the operation of such a device. The curriculum for this qualification includes the
542

assessment of the technical aspect of images but not the medical conclusion that can be drawn from these. Nonetheless, local regulations regarding qualifications and restrictions should be known and followed.
To monitor the individual dose, the use of personal dosimetry is compulsory in many countries when dealing with ionizing radiation within the so-called radiation control zone. Regarding intra-operative imaging, this includes the operation room (technically, the control area is a circular area around the x-ray source with a radius of 4 metres, depending on the device). In Germany, these films are evaluated on a monthly term; in cases where the threshold for monthly or annual dose is exceeded, the staff member is not allowed to continue working in radiation control areas for the rest of the year.
Indeed, there are many factors that can be controlled by the surgeon regarding radiation protection. This starts with knowledge of the settings of the device and how they should be applied. In trauma and orthopaedic surgery, it is usually sufficient to take single shots instead of constant fluoroscopy. This automatically causes a considerably lower radiation, so dynamic fluoroscopy should only be used when needed, for example in osteosyntheses of the humeral head, where rotation of the upper arm under fluoroscopy is used to assure the correct screw length and extra-articular position of the screw tips. If used, length of fluoroscopy time should be as low as possible.
Most of the emitted radiation does not reach the detector and is either scattered or absorbed in the patient. Following this, the amount of scattered radiation is up to two times higher on the side of the source, so, whenever possible, the detector should be positioned above the table in anteroposterior (AP) views and the surgeon should position himself on the side of the detector in lateral views.
Most currently available C-arms offer methods for limiting the exposed field. These are slit diaphragms for making the viewable field smaller, for example when assessing long bones, and iris diaphragms for concentrically

Intra-operative imaging in trauma surgery

diminishing the viewable field (Fig. 1 shows a situation with iris diaphragms). Depending on the actual device, this might keep the local dose for the patient equal, but lowers scattered radiation and the risk of exposure to the surgeon's hand. Additionally, the contrast of the image might be increased.
Lead gowns including thyroid protection need to be worn by all staff in the operating room as long as the procedure is running and radiation may be applied. These gowns need to be checked regularly (and replaced, if necessary) to ensure that the structure of the material is intact. Of course, the patient should be protected with lead mats as well, as long as these mats do not hinder the acquisition of the correct views.
The most effective method to reduce exposure is to keep a distance. All staff that do not need to be close to the C-arm should try to position themselves as far away from the C-arm as possible; the exposure is reduced by square with increasing distance. Outside the radiological control zone (4 metres for most C-arms), there is no significant exposure. For the surgeon it is important to keep his or her own body - especially the hands! - out of the beam.
Maintenance of radiation protection is a team task and is mandatory to reduce risk for all of the staff and the patient.
Technical aspects
Intra-operative imaging with a C-arm, as is used today, was introduced for the first time in 1955 by Diethelm et al14. The current status of surgical procedures and advanced techniques such as minimally invasive surgery in trauma and orthopaedic surgery cannot be imagined

without the continuous improvement of imaging technologies. Following this, it is mandatory for the surgeon to consider carefully the technical handling of these machines as well as the possibilities and limitations for intra-operative imaging. Depending on the actual on-site situation, the surgeon may be the only person who has knowledge about the specific abilities of the C-arm used, or the surgeon may even have to operate the C-arm. In many cases, there will be specially trained staff to take care of technical issues, but evaluation of the images - including potentially incorrect settings of image acquisition - must be handled by the surgeon. Usually there is no structured curriculum for medical staff regarding either the technical handling or evaluation of the images. The appropriate training regarding when and how images are acquired, and what consequences can be drawn from these, is disposed to the particular disciplines. Hence, the quality of this training depends very much on the emphasis of the importance of these procedures in the institution concerned.
Two-dimensional imaging and fluoroscopy
Technically, a C-arm consists of an x-ray source and a corresponding detector at the opposite end of the `C'. The emitted radiation passes through the object in between both ends of the C-arm and is diluted depending on the degree of radio-opacity of the object. Most of the C-arms currently in use are based upon a so-called image intensifier. The x-ray radiation that passes the object hits a fluorescent surface and causes the production of light photons. These photons are accelerated in a tube, electronically intensified and registered with a video camera. This camera is either directly linked to a TV screen or - as used in current techniques - digitalized and sent to a computer for post-processing and storage. The technical evolution in detector technology led to the construction of flat panel detectors in which the x-ray radiation is directly converted into a digital signal that can be used as raw data for image reconstruction. As there is no longer any need for a tube or video chain, these detectors can be constructed in a much more compact fashion than detectors based on image intensifiers. The image quality is improved in terms of contrast and resolution, while the dosage is equal or might even be reduced15.
Stationary radiography systems as used in radiological departments have a stronger power supply, so the dosage that is used for one image is higher than in the intra-­ operative setting. Due to this, the image quality in terms of contrast and resolution is lower in intra-operative imaging. Also, the size of the objects `fitting' into one view is much lower and limited by the distance between both ends of the C-arm. This is a restriction that particularly applies in the management of shaft fractures of long

543

bones, as the axis of the total bone can barely be visualized. Additionally, depending on the anatomical region, the soft tissues can absorb significant amounts of radiation. In the obese, this causes reduction of contrast, so the assessment of the bony structures is hindered. Figure 2 shows an intra-operative lateral view of the sacrum with two screws fixating the sacroiliac (SI) joints on both sides. Due to low contrast, the delimitation of the bone towards the surrounding soft tissue is very restricted.
While there are established standards for axis alignments and patient positioning in radiological departments, the intra-operative settings vary a lot due to positioning requirements, actual surgical procedure and patient-related factors such as obesity or limitations in joint movement. The surgeon is responsible for ensuring the correct positioning of the operational field and the possibility of acquiring the standard views of the actual region with the C-arm.
Standard views
The most essential knowledge for the surgeon is how to position the C-arm depending on the operation in order to acquire the views required in this situation. Although there are many situations in trauma surgery that are far from standard, these views should be mastered. In this section, standard procedures for four common fracture types are described.
Distal radius
The joint surface of the distal radius is tilted to the palmar side by 5° to 10° in the AP view. The most common

technique in osteosynthesis of the distal radius is fixation with a palmar locking plate. When controlling the implant position and reduction, the arm must not be positioned straight on the table. Instead, the elbow has to be elevated to the extent of 5° to 10°, to balance out this anatomical tilt. Only using this technique is it possible to assess reduction, implant positioning and screw placement. The same applies to the lateral view, where the joint line is tilted 23° to 30°. To obtain a correct view, the hand has to be elevated to this level. Figure 3 shows a correct orientation with distinct presentation of the radiocarpal joint space in both views.
This differs from standard views in radiology. Here, usually the arm and wrist are positioned parallel to the detector, so the resulting images are different from those that need to be acquired in an intra-operative setting.
Proximal humerus
In osteosyntheses of the proximal humerus, there are special circumstances that make acquisition of the correct standard views challenging. Usually, the patient is positioned in the so-called beach-chair position. Following this, the upper arm is already tilted towards the floor. This has to be evened out by tilting the C-arm, so the level of the central beam is perpendicular to the axis of the humeral shaft. The standard views are defined by an AP view with maximal extension of the greater tubercle and a lateral view with 90° outward rotation of the humerus. When assessing screw length, the spherical shape of the humeral head must be considered. As mentioned above, it might be helpful in these cases to assess the implant length with constant fluoroscopy while rotating the arm. Figure 4 shows AP and lateral views of the proximal humerus.

Proximal femur
For osteosynthesis of the proximal femur, there are similar issues as with the proximal humerus. For successful minimally invasive procedures, it is crucial to be able to obtain standard AP and lateral views. Independent of using an extension table or similar device, the contralateral leg is elevated in a leg holder. The C-arm is placed oblique between the legs to make an axial view possible. The AP position is perpendicular to the floor. When adjusting the axial view, it needs to be kept in mind that the anteversion of the femoral neck of 10° to 15° must be compensated by tilting the C-arm to this extent. The correct view is determined by a straight connection from the femoral neck to the femoral shaft axis. Figure 5 shows AP and axial views with an implant in place. Note the straight line of the femoral neck continuing to the femoral shaft in the axial view.
Ankle joint
The positioning of the C-arm for osteosyntheses of the ankle joint is easier, as there is no collision hazard of the device with the patient. When adjusting the views, it is important to consider that an AP view perpendicular to the floor will not allow assessment of the joint lines. The lower leg has to be rotated 15° to 20° inwards to obtain the so-called Mortise view. In this view, the medial and lateral joint space should be equal in size and the margins of the talus should show no double-contour. For adjusting the lateral view, the condyles of the talus must be positioned stacked exactly above each other and the tibiotalar joint space must be visible completely. An important issue when treating ankle fractures is to determine syndesmotic injuries. After completion of the osteosynthesis of the distal fibula, the stability of the syndesmosis is tested with constant fluoroscopic view in the Mortise position. With a suitable instrument, lateral traction is applied to

the fibula while the lower leg is fixed. A positive finding is considered when there is significant movement of the fibula in the distal tibiofibular joint (see Fig. 6 - in this case, no movement of the fibula was observed). If this occurs, reduction of the fibula and fixation of the distal tibiofibular joint is necessary. When it comes to assessing the position of the fibula in the tibial incision, it is difficult to determine definitely the reduction in two-dimensional (2D) imaging as it is not possible to acquire an axial view of this joint. If available, it is helpful to perform an intraoperative 3D scan.
Intra-operative 3D imaging
The anatomical reconstruction of joint surfaces and the extra-articular position of implants are crucial for surgical success in the osteosynthesis of complex joint fractures. As described above, these parameters are intra-operatively controlled by 2D imaging in standard views as well as dynamic fluoroscopy to assess, for example, the course of single screws. However, there are situations where the assessment of the joint surface or the course of implants is not completely visible in 2D imaging. This is especially the case when the joint surface has a concave configuration, such as in the acetabulum or the tibial head, or in irregularly shaped bones like the calcaneus16-18. Another aspect is the impossibility of acquiring axial views in many cases, as in the spine or the ankle joint19-21. Under these circumstances, intra-operative 3D imaging might be a helpful adjunct to immediately ensure the reduction quality and extra-articular position of implants.
Usually, intra-operative 3D imaging is achieved by special C-arms that can be used in 2D mode as any other C-arm. For 3D acquisition, these devices perform a motorized movement around the region of interest and automatically acquire a large number of images (typically 50 to 100). With computational methods, coming from CT, a CT-like dataset is generated. These volumes are cubic with

a length of the edges of typically 12 to 14 cm. A typical example is shown in Figure 7. In these views, implant position and reduction of the fracture as well as the reduction of the distal fibula in the tibial incision can be assessed completely. With the help of intra-operative 3D imaging, in the majority of cases it is possible to completely assess the reduction quality and implant position; therefore, in our institution it is used commonly after certain procedures. This applies to osteosyntheses of the acetabulum, the tibial head and plafond, the calcaneus, syndesmotic injuries and difficult spinal instrumentation. In a prospective clinical register, each case with intra-operative 3D imaging is documented with regard to the anatomic region and the findings of the imaging. With the help of that register, the incidence of intra-operative revisions can be determined. In an analysis of cases over eight years and 1841 scans, an intra-operative revision rate of up to 40.3% was observed22. This underlines the essential benefit of this technique, as a 3D scan is performed only when the reduction and implant placement is considered correct in fluoroscopic views.

This method does have some disadvantages compared with CT data, especially regarding artefacts caused by implants. Depending on the material and length of the implants, image assessment is severely limited or even impossible23. When assessing longer spinal segments or larger regions of the pelvis the volume might be too small, so several scans might be necessary.
In terms of high-end solutions to avoid the above-­ mentioned limitations, there are special CT scanners available that are constructed to meet intra-operative needs. This includes a large gantry opening and a mobile design which can change between several settings (Fig. 8). These devices improve the intra-operative 3D image capabilities with very large fields of view (including complete spine or complete pelvis)24. As an example, an intra-operative total pelvis scan is shown in Figure 9. However, these devices have special requirements for radiation protection and training of the operating staff. Regarding the cost for the devices as well as the necessary building modifications, intra-operative CT scanners are reserved for special centres with large numbers of eligible cases.

Navigation
Since the late 1980s, different approaches to allow intraoperative navigation in 3D datasets were developed, and as of today there are several products available. Most of them are based on infrared tracking of specially equipped instruments and a fixed reference that should be placed close to the surgical field. Usually, an intra-operative 3D scan is performed and registered with the navigation system. It is also possible to use a pre-operative CT or MRI scan for intra-operative navigation, which is very common in neurosurgery.
During surgery, these data can be used to visualize the position of the instruments in the 3D views, so the placement and handling of instruments and implants is facilitated. Figure 10 shows the planning process for a screw in

the SI joint on the right side. Especially in anatomical regions with difficult visibility in 2D views, particularly the spine and posterior pelvic ring, this improves the placement of implants and security of the operation25-28. Several studies have shown that the placement of SI screws is improved when 3D navigation is used29,30. A situation that illustrates the benefit of navigation is the dysmorphic sacrum. Dysmorphic means a variation in the configuration of the sacral ala leading to a narrowing of the safe zone for SI screw placement. Additionally, fluoroscopic techniques become unreliable in these patients, so 3D navigation significantly improves the precision of screw placement and thus patient safety31. In combination with an intra-operative CT scanner, navigation is a very powerful tool for improving the accuracy and precision of the surgical procedure32.

Conclusions
Intra-operative imaging in trauma and orthopaedic surgery is a demanding skill to be mastered by the surgeon. Even if the operation itself is carried out by staff in many cases, the technical settings and their application must be known. Radiation protection measures are important (and the responsibility of the surgeon), as uncontrolled application of ionizing radiation can be harmful to the patient and staff. The standard views for the most common fractures and the characteristics of the specific settings are mandatory to assure the success of the osteosynthesis. If available, intra-operative 3D imaging and navigation are valuable adjuncts to assure extra-articular implant positioning and anatomical reduction.

Abstract. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases and can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer in severe cases. In recent years, the incidence of NAFLD has increased substantially. The trend has continued to increase and has become a key point of concern for health systems. NAFLD is often associated with metabolic abnormalities caused by increased visceral obesity, including insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis and systemic microinflam mation. Therefore, the pathophysiological mechanisms of NAFLD must be clarified to develop new drug treatment strategies. Recently, researchers have conducted numerous studies on the pathogenesis of NAFLD and have identified various important regulatory factors and potential molecular mechanisms, providing new targets and a theoretical basis for the treatment of NAFLD. However, the pathogenesis of NAFLD is extremely complex and involves the interrelation ship and influence of multiple organs and systems. Therefore,

the condition must be explored further. In the present review, the abnormal metabolic process, including glucose, lipid, amino acid, bile acid and iron metabolism are reviewed. It was concluded that NAFLD is associated with an imbalanced metabolic network that involves glucose, lipids, amino acids, bile acids and iron, and lipid metabolism is the core metabolic process. The current study aimed to provide evidence and hypotheses for research and clinical treatment of NAFLD.

1. Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is caused by excess fat deposits in the liver due to nonalcoholic factors (1), such as a high fat diet, a high cholesterol diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The condition represents a range of liver diseases from nonalcoholic fatty liver, also known as simple steatosis, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis (1,2). NAFLD can be characterized by metabolic syndrome (MS) features, including altered glucose and lipid metabolism, imbalanced amino acid homeostasis, increased bile acid and excess hepatic iron (3). Due to the increased inci dence of obesity and associated MS, NAFLD has become the most common liver disease worldwide. The global prevalence of NAFLD is currently estimated to be 25.2% (4). Notably, with the radical changes in Chinese lifestyle such as sedentary behaviour and a hypercaloric diet, the prevalence of NAFLD in China increased to 32.9% in 2018 (5). Therefore, clarifica tion of the pathophysiological mechanisms of NAFLD are necessary for the development of pharmacological treatment strategies.
The pathogenesis of NAFLD remains unclear and it has been widely accepted to follow the `multiplehit' hypothesis.

SHAO et al: ABNORMAL METABOLISM INVOLVED IN NAFLD

According to this hypothesis, NAFLD is a complex disease and its pathogenesis involves diet, genetic, environment and metabolic factors that progress through different stages during the occurrence and development of NAFLD (6). Elevated levels of circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) combined with insulin resistance (IR) and excessive accumulation of triglyc erides in liver cells serve a major role in the development of NAFLD (7). Additionally, lipid accumulation also responsible for oxidative stress, inflammatory response and lipotoxicity, predisposing patients to progressive liver injury (8). IR, lipotoxicity, inflammatory response, genetic polymorphisms, adipokines and intestinal flora can affect the pathogenesis of NAFLD (8). However, the interaction between these mecha nisms and their changes in the occurrence and development of NAFLD remain to be determined.
Since NAFLD involves multiple metabolic pathways (Fig. 1), more attention should be paid to abnormal metabo lism that may worsen metabolic disorders (913). In the present review, the abnormal metabolism in NAFLD, including glucose, lipid, amino acids, bile acids and iron metabolism are summarized with the aim to provide evidence and hypotheses for NAFLD diagnosis and possible therapeutic strategies.
2. Glucose metabolism in NAFLD
An important factor affecting NAFLD is hyperglycemia, which stimulates insulin secretion and increases triglyceride synthesis by the liver, resulting in an increase in triglycerides in the blood and gradual accumulation in the liver to form fatty liver. Prolonged and chronic hyperglycemia causes hepatocel lular damage, alters the structure and function of pancreatic  cells and causes IR, thereby inducing and accelerating the occurrence and progression of NAFLD (14).
Fructose metabolism is similar to glucose metabolism and both lead to triglyceride generation. The main difference between these processes is that glucose is primarily metabo lized by glucose kinases or hexokinases, while fructose is mainly metabolized by fructose kinases (15). Fructose metab olism in the liver contributes to increased hepatic lipogenesis and inhibits mitochondrial oxidation of longchain fatty acids. Numerous patients with NAFLD have insufficient anti oxidant capacities to inhibit fructose metabolism (16). A recent study demonstrated that dietary fructose promoted hepatic lipogenesis via microbiotaderived acetate (17).
Insulin is closely associated with carbohydrate metabo lism disorder in NAFLD as it facilitates the formation of fat and inhibits lipases, and participates in glucose homeo stasis and hepatic glycogen synthesis (18). IR, an important pathophysiological basis for carbohydrate metabolism disor ders, is consistent with NAFLD development. Glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP1) stimulates insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon in a strictly glucosedependent manner (19). Furthermore, GLP1 serves a role in coordination with fibro blast growth factor 21 (FGF21) (20). GLP1 and FGF21 affect insulin function and secretion, respectively (21). Additionally, lysyl oxidaselike 2 (LOXL2) expression is directly propor tional to the severity of IR and LOXL2 inhibitors can prevent NASH from progressing to fibrosis (22).
IR is a major feature of NAFLD and can lead to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hyperinsulinemia due to glucose

intolerance, which has additional effects on glucose metabo lism (23). The regulatory mechanisms of IR involve chloride ions (Cl) and insulin signaling. Cl are common and affluent anions in living organisms. Chloride channels (ClCs) func tion as a type of permeable channel or protein, which are encoded and regulated by the genes of ClC family, ClC2, a member of ClCs family. Fatty deposits can be abundant by the expression of ClC2, which is activated by fatty acids in the liver and induces IR (24). The transduction of insulin signaling is regulated by insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (25). When insulin binds to insulin receptors, IRS1 is phosphorylated at tyrosine 608/612 to activate the insulin signaling pathway. However, the phosphorylation of IRS1 at serine 307/312 suppresses glucose absorption and leads to IR, which inhibits insulin signaling. Additionally, dysregulation of protein kinase B2 (Akt2) signaling pathways has been reported in NAFLD. Akt2 facilitates glucose uptake and suppresses IR. Furthermore, Akt2 is inhibited by fetuinA, a type of hepato kine synthesized in the liver, which inhibits insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in skeletal muscles and the activity of Akt2 to reduce glucose uptake (26). Increasing evidence has demonstrated that disordered cellular Cl concentrations are associated with lipid accumulation, high blood pressure and atherosclerosis (27,28). Notably, chloride channel 2 (CIC2) inhibition alleviates high fat dietinduced hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis (24).
GLP1. GLP1 is an antihyperglycemic hormone that induces pancreatic  cells to secrete insulin. Trevaskis et al (29) demon strated that GLP1 receptor agonists significantly improve metabolism and biochemical and histopathological indicators in NASH mice. Bernsmeier et al (30) reported that patients with NAFLD exhibited IR and insufficient GLP1 secretion. Furthermore, Chellali et al (31) demonstrated that patients with NAFLD, T2D or NAFLD+T2D generally exhibited IR and that compared with controls, plasma GLP1 levels were obviously lower in patients with NAFLD, T2D or NAFLD+T2D. GLP1 receptor agonists have been approved for T2D treatment and an increasing number of previous studies have demonstrated that they are also effective for NAFLD (3235).
FGF21. FGF21 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family and is a hormonelike endocrine factor secreted by the liver and serves a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis of glycolipid metabolism (36). Li et al (37) reported that serum FGF21 levels, such as the fatty liver index (38), which is an already known score associated with steatosis presence, have specificity for the early diagnosis of NAFLD. FGF21 is primarily produced by the liver and specifically acts on liver, fat and islet cells, FGF21 can reduce body weight, wholebody fat mass and liver triglyceride content, increases fat utiliza tion and energy expenditure, and improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in the liver and adipose tissue (39). FGF21 is independent of insulin and regulates blood glucose and blood lipid (39). FGF21 can reduce glucose levels without triggering hypoglycemia, and increase the glucose uptake in brown fat, the browning of white fat and the increase in overall energy consumption. As a metabolic regulator, FGF21 signifi cantly reduces the expression of key genes involved in lipid metabolism, including stearoylcoenzyme A desaturase 1 and

glucokinase, reduces fat syntheses, upregulates the expression of key genes involved in lipolysis, including leptin receptor and insulinlike growth factor binding protein 2 and promotes fat decomposition and energy metabolism, thereby reducing the accumulation of fat in liver tissue and restoring normal liver function (40).
LOXL2. IR is associated with the severity of liver fibrosis, the main determinant of NAFLD prognosis (41,42). LOXL2 is an enzyme that promotes the network of collagen fibers of the extra cellular matrix (43). LOXL2 expression is strongly correlated with the amount of steatosis and severity of fibrosis. Hepatic LOXL2 upregulation was specifically detected in patients with NAFLD and T2D progressing to advanced fibrosis (22). Ikenaga et al (44) reported that LOXL2 expression was virtu ally absent from healthy livers while strongly induced in fibrotic livers and that LOXL2 inhibition promoted fibrosis reversal. Therefore, LOXL2 antibodies are a potential treatment for liver fibrosis. A monoclonal antibody against LOXL2, simtuzumab, has been developed and is currently in phase II trials (45).
3. Lipid metabolism in NAFLD
NAFLD is characterized by the significant accumulation of lipids, such as triglyceride (TG), FFAs and cholesterol, in hepatocytes and serum, indicating that altered lipid metabo lism is crucial in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Excess TG and serum FFAs are common in NAFLD. Excess TG accu mulate from de novo hepatic lipogenesis and the dietary fat supply, while FFAs accumulate due to lipolysis in visceral adipose tissue (46). FFAs participate in fatty acid oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) response, lysosomal dysfunction and cell death via the mitochondrial pathway to induce NAFLD (47). Trans fatty acids (TFAs) facilitate lipogenic gene expression and hepatic lipid accumulation by causing severe steatosis and by regulating Kupffer cells (48).

There are two main pathways for lipid metabolism: The oxidation of liver FFAs and the binding of very lowdensity lipoproteins (VLDLs) in the liver (49,50). When lipid synthesis pathways increase, IR develops and liver lesions are generated. However, by promoting oxidation and inhibiting the synthesis of lipids, IR and liver lesions can be alleviated. Additionally, certain lipids bind to VLDL and are transported out of the liver. In the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), TGrich VLDL is transfused and secreted and transported from the liver in secretory vesicles. Excessive liver lipids induce ERS via the SER and increase the production of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, a variety of lipid metabolismrelated regulatory factors are closely associated with NAFLD. However, whether these regulatory factors are an effective target for the treatment of NAFLD remains to be elucidated through further research (51,52).
Inflammatory cytokines. Numerous previous studies have demonstrated that various inflammatory cytokines serve key roles in the progression of steatosis to NASH (53.54). Zahran et al (55) reported that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels were elevated in a patient population with NASH compared with controls. Furthermore, Bocsan et al (56) demonstrated that plasma interleukin (IL)6 and TNF levels were significantly higher in patients with NASH compared with controls. TNF is produced by hepatocytes and infil trating immune cells. Moreover, it stimulates liver steatosis, which in turn increases serum TG levels (57). Additionally, TNF activates Kupffer cells, which in turn stimulate liver fibrosis during NAFLD progression (58). IL6 is primarily secreted by adipose tissue and, as an important mediator of fatty acid metabolism, serves a paradoxical role in the liver: While the hepatic IL6 signaling pathway has a protective effect against the development of liver steatosis, it may also promote liver inflammation (59).

SHAO et al: ABNORMAL METABOLISM INVOLVED IN NAFLD

Patatinlike phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3). PNPLA3 is a secretory adipose factor that is widely expressed in human tissues, particularly in liver and adipose tissues (60). In 2008, Romeo et al (61) conducted a genomewide associa tion analysis to screen for pathogenic genes in NAFLD. A group of nonsynonymous sequence variations including Hispanic, AfricanAmerican and EuropeanAmerican participants (n=9.229) were selected and polymorphic PNPLA3 rs738409 in liver tissue was identified in order to identify genetic variants contributing to differences in hepatic fat content. Increased concentrations of fat and liver inflammation were highly associated with Homeostatic Model Assessment of IR and the mechanism of liver damage may be associated with intrahepatic lipid deposition. Additionally, Wang et al (62) studied 768 patients from the Han Chinese population and confirmed the association between PNPLA3 rs738409 and an increased risk for NAFLD in this population, emphasizing its effects on NAFLD among multiple ethnic groups. Several previous studies in a metaanal ysis demonstrated that genetic variation in PNPLA3 increases the risk of NAFLD in European and Chinese populations (63). Numerous previous studies have reported that PNPLA3 gene polymorphism is associated with an increase in liver fat content and liver inflammation (6365). As an enzyme with a bidirec tional ability to regulate fat metabolism, PNPLA3 promotes lipid synthesis and may be involved in ectopic lipid deposition and IR, the two key factors in the pathogenesis of NAFLD; therefore, PNPLA3 leads to the pathogenesis of NAFLD (66).
Peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors (PPARs). PPAR ligandactivated transcription factors control different aspects of lipid catabolism. The PPAR subtype PPAR is highly expressed in the liver, where it promotes genes that regulate the oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, inducing PPARregulated lipid catabolic pathway genes may enhance NAFLD. Another subtype, PPAR, is a nuclear receptor that regulates insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism, and a molecular target for insulin sensitizing agents. PPAR is expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to influence perilipin expression, which regulates lipid droplet metabolism. The activation of HSCs largely contributes to the fibrogenesis process (67).
Sterol regulatory elementbinding proteins (SREBPs). SREBPs control cholesterol, TGs and fatty acids. SREBP1c is a subtype predominantly localized in the adult liver and is required for simple steatosis during fasting. Overexpressed SREBP1c leads to excessive TG accumulation in the liver and ultimately to NAFLD. Thus, the inhibition of SREBP1c is a preventive approach (68). PPAR and SREBP1 are key determinants of NAFLD (69).
SREBP2 is an important nuclear transcription factor that regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Its activa tion promotes the accumulation of hepatocyte cholesterol by facilitating cholesterol synthesis and uptake and suppressing reverse cholesterol transport (70). Additionally, SREBP2 predicts NASH and widely impairs pancreatic  cell func tion, tissue insulin sensitivity and adipokine and lipoprotein responses to fat uptake. Thus, elevated SREBP2 increases the prevalence of NAFLD and cardiovascular diseases. Abnormal SREBP2 activation can be reversed by depleting cholesterol in adipocytes (71).

Adiponectin. Adiponectin, an insulinsensitizing adipocyto kine, is an adipocytederived antiinflammatory mediator that acts via two receptors that elicit AMP kinase signaling (72). Adipose tissue is a major site of endogenous adiponectin production. Previous research has demonstrated that plasma levels of adiponectin are significantly diminished in visceral obesity and states of IR such as NASH, T2D and athero sclerosis (73,74). Adiponectin and its agonists may represent potential alternative therapeutic approaches for NAFLD treatment.
Leptin. Leptin is a hormone secreted mainly by the adipocytes in white adipose tissue and is a product of the obese gene (75). Perfield et al (76) reported that de novo lipogenesis was induced and that hepatic mitochondria were reduced and inhibited in leptindeficient NAFLD mice. ZelberSagi et al (77) demon strated that leptin levels were significantly higher in patients with NAFLD compared with patients without NAFLD at 7 years of followup. Furthermore, Polyzos et al (78) revealed that serum leptin levels in patients with NAFLD were higher compared with controls and that serum leptin levels were asso ciated with increased severity of NAFLD. However, while a lack of leptin may lead to liver steatosis, which can be reversed by leptin replacements (79), excessive leptin may cause liver inflammation and fibrosis.
Liver X receptors (LXRs). As members of the metabolic nuclear receptor superfamily, LXRs influence the regulation of cholesterol absorption, conveyance, transportation and excretion (80). Research has demonstrated that LXR activation regulates cholesterol homeostasis, induces antiinflammatory effects and increases insulin sensitivity (81). Inhibiting liver LXR transcriptional activity in NAFLD effectively reduces liver steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. However, research has found that LXR is highly expressed in the livers of patients with NAFLD and increases with the severity of NAFLD. LXR expression is directly proportional to liver lipid deposition (82). However, the uncertainty about whether LXR activation or inhibition is beneficial for NAFLD treatment has hindered the development of LXRrelated drugs (83).
Plin2. Plin2, also known as adipophilin or adipose differentiationrelated protein, is commonly reported on the surface of lipid droplets in most tissues and hepatic lipids effectively induce Plin2 expression. Plin2 inhibition increases insulin sensitivity and reduces fatty liver (84). While perilipin 2antisense oligonucleotide (Plin2ASO) treatment decreases steatosis, it also promotes proliferation and fibrosis. Furthermore, Plin2ASO inhibits the expression of genes that participate in TG biosynthesis and utilization, including diac ylglycerol Oacyltransferase 2, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase and fatty acid oxidation carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 by suppressing transcription factors. Additionally, Plin2ASO therapy significantly decreases the expression of genes related to cholesterol and steroid metabolism, reduces hepatic VLDL secretion and increase insulin sensitivity (85).
Choline. Choline is an important phospholipid component present in cell membranes and is ingested exogenously and synthesized endogenously. Choline is one of the methyl donors

EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE 20: 26, 2020

5

for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine in the liver, which is required for the synthesis and secretion of VLDL. Therefore, choline serves a vital role in liver lipid transport (86). Choline has a negative correlation with NAFLD development by affecting intracellular lipid metabolism and muscle membrane lipid composition (87). Dietary choline is metabolized by intestinal microbiota and converted to trimethylamine, resulting in choline deficiency in the liver. Choline deficiency hinders the synthesis and secretion of VLDL, leads to the accumulation of TG in the liver and promotes the onset of NAFLD. Highfat diets lead to the formation of intestinal microbiota that convert dietary choline into methylamines, reducing circulating plasma levels of phosphatidylcholine to produce similar effects of cholinedeficient diets and causing NASH (88). Cholinedeficient diets have been used to establish animal models of NASH (89).
4. Amino acid metabolism in NAFLD
Impaired liver function leads to an imbalance in amino acid homeostasis. Amino acid metabolism is extensively altered in NAFLD, involving branchedchain amino acids (BCAAs), aromatic amino acids (AAAs), methionine, homocysteine and arginine. Additionally, fatty liver is associated with deregu lated liver expression of aminotransferases (90). The profiles of amino acid metabolism gene sets can be used to evaluate hepatic oxidative stress in patients with NAFLD (91).
BCAAs. BCAAs are amino acids with nonlinear aliphatic sidechains and include the essential amino acids leucine, valine and isoleucine. Cheng et al (92) reported increased serum BCAAs in patients with NAFLD. Lake et al (91) demonstrated that during the progression of steatosis to NASH, serum leucine, isoleucine and valine levels were significantly increased. This increase is associated with liver fat accumulation during the early stages of NAFLD. BCAAs mediate numerous biological functions in NAFLD. Firstly, BCAAs regulate glucose metabolism by inducing insulin signaling (93,94). Secondly, they increase lipolysis and hyperlipidemia, which cause hepatic lipotoxicity that leads to inhibited autophagy in hepatocytes (95). Thirdly, BCAAs are beneficial for treating cirrhosis by decreasing portal vein pres sure and increasing mean artery pressure (96). Finally, BCAAs induce higher branchedchain keto acid dehydrogenase E1 expression levels in skeletal muscles, which facilitates BCAA metabolism in muscle tissue (97).
Leucine supplementation has been demonstrated to acti vate mammalian target of rapamycin, which mediates cellular proliferation and protein synthesis, and increases insulin sensitivity. However, while leucine alleviates T2D, it also exacerbates NAFLD, making it difficult to use in NAFLD treatment (98).
AAAs. AAAs are a class of amino acids that have aromatic rings and include tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Celinski et al (99) demonstrated that tryptophan substan tially attenuated the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and improved certain parameters (glutamyl transferase, triglyceride and lowdensity lipoprotein) of lipid metabolism in patients with NAFLD. Chen et al (100) reported that

serum phenylalanine concentration was twofold higher in patients with NAFLD compared with controls. Furthermore, Jin et al (101) investigated the metabolic pathways that were altered in association with hepatic steatosis in adolescents and demonstrated that plasma tyrosine levels were positively correlated with the severity of liver steatosis. Phenylalanine is catalyzed to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase in the liver, where it is further metabolized (102). Presently, the mechanism of AAA metabolic disorders in NAFLD remains unclear. A possible explanation may be that tyrosine enters the ketogenic pathway and is directly degraded to acetyl coenzyme A via ketogenic action (101). Therefore, increased phenylalanine and tyrosine intake may contribute to fat deposition in the liver.
Methionine and homocysteine. Methionine is an essential sulfurcontaining amino acid that is mainly metabolized in the liver (103). Homocysteine is a sulfhydrylcontaining amino acid produced and catabolized primarily in the liver and increased homocysteine concentrations in the event of liver injury. Alternatively, elevated homocysteine may conversely promote the progression of liver damage (104). Both methionine and homocysteine are associated with NAFLD. Methionine metabolism impacts the methylation process that leads to the production of glutathione and methylargi nines, and regulates homocysteine concentrations. However, methionine deficiency leads to impaired methyltransferase and antioxidative reactions, and elevated homocysteine (105). Increased homocysteine causes hyperhomocysteinemia, which alters intracellular lipid metabolism to facilitate fat accumulation (106).
Arginine. Arginine has antioxidant effects on NASH by inhibiting cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E member 1 activity and by decreasing TNF and antioxidant enzyme concentrations (107). Dogru et al (108) reported that increased circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine may be used as an early marker for NAFLD. Additionally, Voloshin et al (109) synthesized a novel chenodeoxycholic acidarginine ethyl ester conjugate that may be used to treat NAFLD. The conjugate reduces liver steatosis by decreasing cholesterol and blood glucose.
Aminotransferases. Aminotransferases are barometers of liver health as they transport excessive amino acids into the circulation to manage liver metabolic derangement associated with severe gluconeogenesis and IR (90). Aspartate amino transferase, alanine transaminase and glutamyltransferase are generally elevated in NAFLD and are positively associated with CIC2 expression in the liver (24,110).
5. Bile acid metabolism in NAFLD
Bile acid is an essential regulator of hepatic fat and glucose metabolism. The concentration of certain serum bile acids increase during the progression of NAFLD, including hydro phobic and cytotoxic bile acids, such as taurodeoxycholic acid and taurocholic acid, respectively (111). Bile acid metabolism is obliterated in NAFLD, likely due to increased hepatic inflammatory signaling (112). Furthermore, increased bile acid levels are associated with altered hepatic transport protein

6

SHAO et al: ABNORMAL METABOLISM INVOLVED IN NAFLD

multidrug resistance protein 3 expression in NAFLD (113). The increased transcription of bile acid synthesis pathway enzymes (including sterol 12hydroxylase, bile acidCoA:amino acid Nacyltransferase and 25hydroxycholesterol7hydroxylase) indicates that the liver attempts to ameliorate hepatotoxicity during the progression of NAFLD (114).
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Nuclear receptors (NRs) are transcriptional factors sensitive to environmental or hormonal signals (115). The expression of NRs, such as FXR, have a negative correlation with NAFLD severity at the transcrip tional level (116). Schiöth et al (117) reported that additional NAFLDinduced modulating effects on type 2 diabetes were associated with altered composition and concentrations of bile acids, which have a continuous effect on FXRdependent regulatory pathways.
FXRs are abundantly expressed in the liver and their upregulation controls glucose, lipid, cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis and inflammation to reduce NAFLD. Firstly, FXRs inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis and peripheral insulin sensitivity to reduce plasma glucose concentrations. Secondly, FXRs suppress bile acid synthesis by inhibiting cholesterol 7 hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the ratelimiting enzyme for the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol (118). The interaction between bile acids and FXRs leads to a reduction in triglyc eride concentrations in plasma and, as a consequence, inhibits hepatic lipid deposition (119).
Niemannpick c1like 1 (NPC1L1). NPC1L1, which reabsorbs cholesterol from bile and transports it to the liver, is expressed on the bile duct membrane and is an aggravating factor of NAFLD (120). NAFLD often exhibits oxidative stress, which leads to increased freeradical activity and lipid peroxidation by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS facilitate the peroxidation of lipids, induction of cytokines, chemoattrac tion of inflammatory cells and HSC activation, and ultimately cause fibrosis with extracellular matrix deposition (1). NPC1L1 resists oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) by transporting free cholesterol in hepatic cells and modulating intracellular cholesterol content, particularly in mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (121). Inhibiting NPC1L1 even tually reduces cholesterol uptake and induces the recovery of key molecules involved in insulin signaling, including Akt phosphorylation and gluconeogenic enzymes (122).
Bile acid transporters. Bile acid transporters are associated with the progression of NAFLD (123). Na+taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), an influx bile acid trans porter, participates in the reabsorption of bile acids (124). As a bile salt export pump, NTCP is an effluent bile acid transporter that exports bile acids. Thus, the upregulation of NTCP causes excessive bile acid concentrations in hepatocytes, which ulti mately leads to cell injury (116). Therefore, blocking apical sodiumdependent bile acid transporter function improves NAFLD (125).
Intestinal flora. Intestinal ecological disruption in NAFLD has been fully documented (126128). Intestinal flora medi ates the detoxification of bile acids and the conversion of primary bile acid to secondary bile acid species, including

lithocholic acid (LCA) and deoxycholic acid. Therefore, inhibiting intestinal microbiota increases hepatic binding to secondary bile acids, which leads to the increased burden of the secondary bile acid system and possible toxic effects. Vitamin D attenuates the toxic effects of LCA and may be a biomarker for the noninvasive diagnosis of NAFLD progression (126128).
TrimethylamineNoxide (TMAO) is a gutfloradepen dent metabolite of choline. Chen et al (129) demonstrated that the increased risk of fatty liver disease may be caused by TMAO due to its effect of decreasing the total bile acid levels via two pathways: By decreasing the synthesis of bile acids via the inhibition of key enzyme CYP7A1 or by limiting the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids between the liver and intestines by decreasing organic anion transporter and multidrug resistance protein family protein expression (130). Therefore, TMAO may possibly affect hepatic TG levels and reverse the direction of cholesterol transport and glucose and energy homeostasis by altering the synthesis and transport of bile acids, indicating that it is a potential risk factor for fatty liver disease (129).
6. Iron metabolism in NAFLD
A total of ~30% of patients with NAFLD exhibit signs of iron metabolism disorders (131). Iron metabolism disorders in NAFLD are commonly associated with excess hepatic iron and deficient serum iron, and NASH livers exhibit decreased transferrin and transferrin receptor 2 (132,133). High dietary iron intake is a risk factor for NAFLD. Excess dietary iron leads to hepatic oxidative stress, inflammation and hepatocel lular ballooning injury, which ultimately causes NASH (134). Moreover, hepatic iron accumulation increases hepatic choles terol synthesis, lipid deposition and impaired hepatic cellular stress responses, which exacerbate NAFLD (135,136). Iron serves a substantial role in the occurrence of oxidative stress as it is a catalyst for ROS generation (137). Oxidative stress often impairs mitochondrial function, which predisposes indi viduals to impaired fatty acid oxidation and eventually leads to steatosis and necrotizing inflammation through various cytokines, such as TNF, IL6 and IL8, malondialdehyde and nitric oxide (138). Furthermore, ROS induces trans ferrin to decrease iron absorption and interact with iron to induce IR by inhibiting carbohydrate consumption, altering the function of adipose tissue and impacting the release of adipokines (132,137). In NAFLD, hepatic iron accumulation is associated with ferritin, hepcidin and human hemochro matosis protein by impacting iron export and import from hepatocytes (131,139).
Ferritin. Ferritin is the primary ironstorage protein in the majority tissues such as in the liver and brain, and increased expression of ferritin indicates iron overload in tissues and circulation. Patients with high ferritin have more severe NASH and advanced fibrosis compared with patients with normal ferritin (140,141). Ferritin can be decreased by restricted calorie and iron intake (142). Serum ferritin concentrations are commonly elevated in patients with NAFLD due to increased iron stores, fat content, oxidative stress, ERS, systemic inflammation and genetic background (143,144).

Hepcidin. Hepcidin is the main ironregulating peptide (145). Decreased hepcidin expression is frequently observed in patients with NAFLD and is considered to be a cause of hepatic iron overload (146). Furthermore, hepcidin suppresses iron influx from diets and efflux from macrophages by inhib iting ferroportin, determining oxidative stress and driving transformation of macrophages into foam cells (147).
7. Conclusion
In summary, NAFLD is associated with an imbalanced meta bolic network that involves glucose, lipids, amino acids, bile acids and iron. Among the participating mechanisms underlying NAFLD, lipid metabolism is the core metabolic process. Lipid metabolism disorders directly lead to lipid deposits. Glucose is linked to lipids by insulin, which is abundant but inefficiently processed in NAFLD. NAFLD often exhibits hyperinsulinemia and IR, which lead to excess TG accumulation and T2D, respectively. Additionally, amino acids simultaneously regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. Bile acid is associated with glucose and lipids through FXRs and choline. Furthermore, iron metabolism is a unique pathway and iron accumulation induces ROS to participate in inflammation and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress also increases lipid accumulation by adding fatty acids and cholesterol, and is regulated by NPC1L1.
Metabolism during NAFLD pathogenesis is very complex and the metabolic processes are not independent; rather, they mutually contribute and influence each other. However, previous studies mainly focus on the pathogenesis of NAFLD from a single perspective, facilitating the separation of factors that were originally interrelated. It is challenging to conduct systematic, integrated and relevant studies or draw corresponding conclusions. Therefore, an investigation and exploration of the detailed mechanism of the pathogenesis of NAFLD is necessary.
Given the complex pathogenesis of NAFLD, a single treat ment for all patients with NAFLD may not be discovered. In the future, personalized treatment may be an effective therapy for NAFLD. With additional indepth studies on its pathogenesis, NAFLD may be effectively prevented and treated in the future.

Abstract Much concern has been raised about the increasing threat to air quality and human health due
to ammonia (NH3) emissions from agricultural systems, which is associated with the enrichment of reactive nitrogen (N) in southern Asia (SA), home of more than 60% the world's population (i.e., the people of West, central, East, South, and Southeast Asia). Southern Asia consumed more than half of the global synthetic N fertilizer and was the dominant region for livestock waste production since 2004. Excessive N application could lead to a rapid increase of NH3 in the atmosphere, resulting in severe air and water pollution in this region. However, there is still a lack of accurate estimates of NH3 emissions from agricultural systems. In this study, we simulated the agricultural NH3 fluxes in SA by coupling the Bidirectional NH3 exchange module (Bi-NH3) from the Community Multi-scale Air Quality model with the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model. Our results indicated that NH3 emissions were 21.3 ± 3.9 Tg N yrÀ1 from SA agricultural systems with a rapidly increasing rate of ~0.3 Tg N yrÀ2 during 1961À2014. Among the emission sources, 10.8 Tg N yrÀ1 was released from synthetic N fertilizer use, and 10.4 ± 3.9 Tg N yrÀ1 was released from manure production in 2014. Ammonia emissions from China and India together accounted for 64% of the total amount in SA during 2000À2014. Our results imply that the increased NH3 emissions associated with high N inputs to croplands would likely be a significant threat to the environment and human health unless mitigation efforts are applied to reduce these emissions.
Plain Language Summary Farming practices in southern Asia (SA), including synthetic fertilizer
and manure application, have resulted in the emission of tremendous amounts of ammonia, an atmospheric constituent that has been linked to human respiratory and cardiovascular ailments and also to atmospheric haze. Ammonia emission is expected to increase due to population growth and increased demand for animal products. Ammonia emission is a critically important environmental issue that needs to be addressed collaboratively by farmers and policymakers in the SA region.

1. Introduction
Anthropogenic perturbation of the global nitrogen (N) cycle has contributed approximately two thirds of the annual flux of reactive N (Nr) into the atmosphere in the early 21st century (Fowler et al., 2015; Galloway et al., 2004). This substantial enrichment of Nr is mainly caused by combustion, industrial ammonia (NH3) production (by the Haber-Bosch process), and leguminous crop cultivation (Erisman et al., 2008; Fowler et al., 2015). Ammonia, as one of the major forms of Nr loss from agricultural soils, has produced adverse impacts on the environment and human health. High N fertilizer use and production of livestock wastes have resulted in a substantial increment of NH3 in the atmosphere (Sutton et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2003). Ammonia is one of the key precursors for aerosol formation in the atmosphere and has caused severe air pollution in East and South Asia, which could have adverse effects on human respiratory and cardiovascular systems and might contribute to visibility reduction and regional haze (Pinder et al., 2007; Seinfeld & Pandis, 1998). For example, the NH3-induced secondary inorganic aerosol was found as a main contributing factor to haze days in China (Fu et al., 2015). Due to the significant increase of NH3 in the atmosphere, more ammonium (NH4+) is returned to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems through dry and wet deposition, introducing excessive amount of Nr into natural ecosystems, which has resulted in the perturbation of the global N and carbon cycles

(Lü & Tian, 2007; Tian et al., 2003). To better assess the potential impact of NH3 emissions on human health and the environment, it is critical to have robust estimates of the spatial and temporal patterns of NH3 emissions from agricultural activities in the southern Asia (SA), home of more than 60% the world's population (i.e., the people of West, central, East, South, and Southeast Asia) (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2016).
The southern Asia region has experienced rapid expansion of agricultural activities (Liu & Tian, 2010; Tian et al., 2014) and has become a hotspot for studies of N-related gas emissions (Tian et al., 2016). The HaberBosch process produced approximately 109 Tg N fertilizer per year globally in 2014, of which more than 50% was consumed in Asia since 2004 (FAOSTAT, 2016). Nitrogen fertilizer is applied to agricultural systems to increase crop yield to meet the rising demand for food. In addition, higher demand for livestock products has stimulated the rapid growth of livestock production in the past century (Dangal et al., 2017; L. Bouwman et al., 2013). Meat consumption in major countries of Asia has grown substantially since 1990 and this trend is expected to continue (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/Food and Agriculture Organization, 2016). Consequently, annual livestock waste production has increased substantially and reached approximately 44.3 ± 0.7 Tg N in the 2010s (Zhang et al., 2017). Increases in both N fertilizer use and livestock excreta have resulted in increased NH3 emissions, but the magnitude and spatiotemporal pattern of NH3 emissions from the agricultural sector in SA countries have not been thoroughly investigated.
Estimating NH3 volatilization from N fertilizer application and livestock excreta has been a research topic of continuous interest for atmospheric and environmental scientists. Previous studies have used numerous approaches to achieve this research goal. The most common methodology to estimate NH3 emissions was based on emission factors (EFs). Zhao and Wang (1994) generated an inventory of NH3 emissions using source-based EFs with considerations of various emission sources from livestock, energy consumption, and N fertilizer use in Asia. Using two constant EFs in upland and rice paddy soils, Zheng et al. (2002) found that the amount of NH3 volatilization was 13.8 Tg N yrÀ1 in 2000 and is expected to approach ~18.9 Tg N yrÀ1 in 2030 in Asia, mainly from increased anthropogenic Nr. Streets et al. (2003) developed an emission inventory for Asia in 2000 using source-based EFs and provided emission estimates for each country in the region. In their study, NH3 emission was estimated to be 27.5 Tg N yrÀ1 from all major anthropogenic sources in Asia, among which 45% and 38% were from fertilizer application and animal productions, respectively. Later, Kurokawa et al. (2013) updated the regional emission inventory using country/subregional-sourcebased EFs. They estimated NH3 emissions to be 32.8 Tg N yrÀ1 in 2008, of which 57% was from fertilizer application, and 20% was from manure management.
A constant EF might not provide an accurate measure of NH3 volatilization and its variability in relation to crops growth or N fertilizer application practices because the conversion of Nr to NH3 involves several biological and chemical processes that are strongly sensitive to environmental conditions (Fowler et al., 2015; Sutton et al., 2014). For example, Gilliland et al. (2003) indicated that static emission factors are inadequate to reflect seasonal variability in NH3 emissions. Fu et al. (2015) pointed out that environmental factors could strongly affect the NH3 volatilization from N fertilizer application. Process-based modeling could therefore address this deficiency by considering climatic variables that are not explicitly considered in the EF approach (Fu et al., 2015; Sutton et al., 2014). The single-layer version of the bidirectional NH3 exchange model (Bi-NH3) was developed in the late 1990s, and only simulated gas exchange processes occurring on leaf surface (Sutton et al., 1995). Later, a two-layer model was developed by also considering NH3 exchange between the soil surface and the atmosphere (Nemitz et al., 2001). Currently, the two-layer Bi-NH3 model is capable of simulating NH3 emissions caused by N fertilizer application in agricultural systems under various environmental conditions (Sutton et al., 2014). Further, the Bi-NH3 model has been fully coupled with various ecosystem/agricultural models to simulate NH3 emissions at the global, regional, and country scale (Bash et al., 2013; Fu et al., 2015; Riddick et al., 2016). For example, the Bi-NH3 module in the Community Multi-scale Air Quality model (CMAQ, Foley et al., 2010) was coupled with the United States Department of Agriculture's Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agroecosystem model (Bash et al., 2013; Massad et al., 2010; Nemitz et al., 2000) to simulate NH3 emissions from N fertilizer application in the United States and China. The simulated results showed that the Bi-NH3 module can be applied to other regions and even at the global scale. However, previous studies using the CMAQ-EPIC approach have provided only 1 year estimates of NH3 emissions.

No previous study has specifically assessed NH3 fluxes on a decadal scale and captured the influence of reactive N sources (synthetic N fertilizer and manure) on regional NH3 emissions. In this study, we have incorporated the Bi-NH3 module into the process-based Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM version 2.0) to estimate NH3 emission from agricultural systems in SA. Our research objectives are to (1) quantify the magnitude of NH3 emissions during the 1961À2014 period at the country level and across the SA subcontinent, (2) investigate spatial and temporal variations in NH3 emissions from agricultural ecosystems during that period, (3) quantify the relative contribution of synthetic N fertilizer use and manure
application on NH3 emissions, and (4) discuss potential threats of increasing NH3 emissions to air quality and human health.

2. Material and Method
2.1. The DLEM Framework for Simulating NH3 Fluxes 2.1.1. Overall N Flow Processes in DLEM The DLEM is a highly integrated process-based ecosystem model that makes daily, spatially-explicit estimates of carbon, nitrogen, and water fluxes within both natural and human-dominated ecosystems (Pan et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2011). There are five key components in the DLEM: biophysical characteristics, plant physiological processes, biogeochemical cycles, vegetation dynamics, and land use. A detailed description of these processes can be found in Tian et al. (2010). The DLEM is capable of simulating the impacts of environmental
changes (e.g., land use, climate, N deposition, atmospheric CO2, N fertilizer use, and manure application) on the full N cycling processes (e.g., volatilization, mineralization, immobilization, denitrification, nitrification, N leaching, and N export and uptake), and N fluxes (e.g., NH3, NO, N2O, and N2) between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere (Lu & Tian, 2013; Ren et al., 2011, 2012; Tian et al., 2010, 2011, 2012; Xu et al.,
2012, 2017). The algorithms for NH3 emissions in the previous version of DLEM can only simulate the unidirectional release of NH3 from soils to the atmosphere but are unable to simulate canopy uptake and transport. Therefore, coupling the CMAQ Bi-NH3 module with DLEM can greatly improve the simulation efficiency of NH3 processes. 2.1.2. NH3 Fluxes in the DLEM-Bi-NH3 Ammonia production is from the transformation of organic compounds and various sources of N inputs. The ammonium (NH4+, g N mÀ2) dynamics in soils:

NH4þ ¼ NH4þsoi þ NH4þinput

(1)

where NH4+soil (g N mÀ2) is the soil NH4+ pool involved in biogeochemical processes, NH4+input (g N mÀ2) is the input of NH4+ from N deposition from the atmosphere, N fertilizer application by human, and crop N
fixation (Figure 1).

In the DLEM, NH4+ inputs into soils experience the following: NH3 volatilization, plant uptake, nitrification, or N leaching, resulting in variable amounts of NH4+ over time. Soil NH4+ decreases because of soil immobilization, nitrification, organic, and inorganic N leaching and runoff, while NH4+ increases due to soil mineralization, crop N fixation, N deposition, and fertilizer/manure N application (Figure 1). These processes are
regulated by environmental factors (e.g., soil temperature, moisture, and pH) and vegetation (e.g., crop type and NH4+ uptake).

The emission of NH3 is calculated as follows:

Femis ¼ Cc=ðRa þ 0:5 RincÞ

(2)

where Cc is the canopy NH3 compensation point, calculated in equation (3), Ra is the aerodynamic resistance, and Rinc is the aerodynamic resistance within the canopy. The unit of NH3 fluxes is g mÀ3 sÀ1; the unit of all compensation points is g mÀ3; the unit of all the above resistances is s mÀ1.

2.2. NH3 Emission From Livestock Excreta
Emission factors for estimating NH3 emissions from livestock excreta were adopted from previous studies. A. Bouwman et al. (2002) provided a median value of EF (23%) to estimate the global NH3 loss from animal manure. The range of EF in A. Bouwman et al. (2002) was 19À29%. Based on the work by Beusen et al. (2008), Riddick et al. (2016) applied a revised EF (17%) to estimate NH3 emissions from animal manure. In this study, we adopted the minimum EF (17%) from Riddick et al. (2016) and the maximum EF (29%) from A. Bouwman

et al. (2002). Then, we calculated the mean value (23%), the same as
the median value in A. Bouwman et al. (2002), to estimate NH3 loss from livestock excreta. The uncertainty range of EFs is 17À29%.

2.3. Input Data and Simulation Setup

The input data sets for the DLEM-Bi-NH3 simulation included gridded-

crop fraction data, dynamic crop distribution maps, topography and soil

properties, climate data, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, and N fer-

tilizer application. The procedure for developing time series data of crop

distribution maps was described in detail by Ren et al. (2012). Cropland

distribution data sets were developed by aggregating the 5 arc min

resolution History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE v3.2)

global cropland distribution data (Klein Goldewijk et al., 2017). Halfdegree daily climate data (including average, maximum, and minimum

air temperature; precipitation; relative humidity; and shortwave radia-

tion) were derived from Climatic Research Unit-National Centers for

Environmental Prediction climate forcing data (Viovy, 2014). The monthly CO2 concentration data set was

obtained from NOAA GLOBALVIEW-CO2 data set derived from atmospheric measurements. Spatially-explicit

time series data set of agricultural N fertilizer use was developed through spatializing International Fertilizer

Industry Association (IFA)-based country-level N fertilizer consumption data according to crop-specific N fer-

tilizer application rates, distribution of crop types, and historical cropland distribution during the 1961À2013

period (Lu & Tian, 2017). All mentioned data sets were applied to drive model simulations during the

1961À2014 period and estimate NH3 emissions from N fertilizer application in SA agricultural systems.

The manure production data set was derived from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations statistics website (FAO, http://faostat.fao.org) and defaulted for N excretion rate as described in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 Guidelines Tier1 (Zhang et al., 2017). We used the gridded manure production data set to estimate NH3 emissions from livestock excreta during 1961À2014.

3. Results
3.1. Contemporary and Historical Patterns of NH3 Emissions

In this study, we estimated NH3 emissions from N fertilizer application and livestock excreta in SA between 2000 and 2014. Our results indicated that the mean NH3 emission was 19.1 ± 3.5 Tg N yrÀ1. Ammonia emissions from N fertilizer application and livestock excreta were 9.7 and 9.4 ± 3.5 Tg N yrÀ1, respectively, during
that period.
In SA, our results indicated that NH3 emissions were 21.3 ± 3.9 Tg N yrÀ1 in 2014 with a rapidly increasing rate of ~0.3 Tg N yrÀ2 during 1961À2014 (Figure 2). Nitrogen fertilizer application increased from 2.6 to
71 Tg N yrÀ1 at a rate of ~1.4 Tg N yrÀ2 during 1961À2013.
Consequently, NH3 emissions from synthetic N fertilizer increased from 0.4 to 10.8 Tg N yrÀ1 in SA. Livestock excreta increased from 19 to 45 Tg N yrÀ1 at a rate of ~0.5 Tg N yrÀ2 during 1961À2014.
The NH3 emission from manure increased from 4.3 ± 1.6 to 10.4 ± 3.9 Tg N yrÀ1 in SA.

Figure 3. Seasonal variation in NH3 emissions from N fertilizer application in southern Asia during the periods 2000À2004, 2005À2009, and 2010À2014.

Ammonia emissions from N fertilizer application during 2000À2014 showed a substantial seasonal variation (Figure 3), which was highly correlated with monthly emission variations. On average, the summer season accounted for 59.8%, while the winter season accounted for 5.6% of annual total emissions. The highest amount of NH3 emission was in July, followed by June and August (Figure 3). The lowest amount of NH3 emission was found in January. Spring and autumn accounted for 22.5% and 12% of annual total emissions, respectively. Both seasons had an increase of NH3 emissions during 2010À2014

compared with emissions during 2000À2004, but with different magnitudes. In comparison to the 2000À2004 period, summer emission grew substantially during 2010À2014. The increase in emission between these two periods was of a lesser magnitude when one considers the spring and autumn months (Figure 3).
3.2. Spatial Pattern of NH3 Emissions Ammonia emissions from croplands varied significantly across the SA region during the past half century (Figure 4). In this study, SA was divided into five regions: Southeast, East, South, West, and central Asia. As shown in Figure 5, East and South Asia were two regions exhibiting the largest emissions and experiencing the most rapid increase in NH3 emissions.

Figure 5. Decadal NH3 emissions in different regions of southern Asia. Emission (y axis of each graph) is reported in Tg N yrÀ1.
In 1961, as a small amount of N fertilizer was applied to croplands in East Asia (e.g., China, South Korea, and Japan), NH3 emissions were concentrated in the north and northeast regions of China, but uniform across Japan and South Korea. A substantial amount of N fertilizer was applied in East and South Asia since the 1980s. There was a clear trend of increased NH3 emissions in most grids of Pakistan and India especially in the northern regions, and China, especially in the North China Plain during 1980À2000. After 2000, more intense NH3 emissions entirely covered India and a majority of arable land in China. A significant increase of NH3 emissions was detected in West Asia especially in Turkey and western Iran, and Southeast Asia especially in Thailand during 1961À2014.
In the 1960s, East Asia emitted more than 50% of the SA's total emissions, while South Asia accounted approximately for 25%. However, a faster rate of NH3 emission increases was found in South Asia during the past half century. During 2010À2014, South Asia accounted for more than 40% of the total emission. In Southeast Asia, NH3 emissions increased from 35 Gg N yrÀ1 to 1.3 Tg N yrÀ1 during 1961À2014 (1 Gg = 10À3 Tg). Compared to South and East Asia, there was a slight increase in NH3 emission in Central and West Asia during the observation period (1961À2014). NH3 emissions increased sharply from 25 Gg N yrÀ1 to 0.4 Tg N yrÀ1 in West Asia during the 1961À2000 period, but only moderately during the last decade (2001À2014). In central Asia, NH3 emission was estimated to be 0.2 Tg N yrÀ1 in 2014, which was approximately sevenfold higher than the emission amount in 1961 (Figure 5).
Similar to N fertilizer-induced NH3 emissions, South and East Asia were two dominant regions that accounted for more than 50% of the total NH3 emission from manure during 1961À2014. Ammonia emission from South Asia grew from 1.2 to 2.12 Tg N yrÀ1, while emission from East Asia increased from 1.4 to 4.0 Tg N yrÀ1 during that period (Figure 5). West Asia was the third largest source of manure-induced NH3 emission and showed an increasing trend (Figure 5). A moderate trend of increased NH3 emission was found in Southeast Asia. There was no significant increase in manure-related NH3 emission in central Asia, a subregion that contributed to less than 10% of the total emission from manure in SA.
3.3. NH3 Emissions From Major Countries
Eleven countries from SA (Table 1) contributed to ~65% of global total N application. China and India together contributed ~77% of total N application among these 11 countries, as shown in Table 1. In

consequence, ~75% of total NH3 emissions were from both countries during 2000À2014. Ammonia emissions from Chinese croplands increased from 0.2 in 1961 to 4.5 Tg N yrÀ1 in 2014. Similarly, in India, NH3 emission rose from 60 Gg N yrÀ1 in 1961 to 3.3 Tg N yrÀ1 in 2014. Compared to China and India, the remaining countries contributed less than 25% of total N application, among which Pakistan had the highest N application and NH3 emission. Turkey, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Iran showed similar total amounts of N fertilizer application; however, Turkey and Iran showed much less NH3 emissions compared to the South and Southeast Asian countries noted above.
We identified 11 countries that showed large manure production amounts during 1961À2014 (Table 1). China and India were the two top producing countries and accounted for approximately 67% of the total manure production during 2000À2014. Ammonia emissions from Chinese livestock wastes increased from 1.0 ± 0.4 in 1961 to 4.1 ± 1.5 Tg N yrÀ1 in 2014. In contrast, NH3 emissions did not show a rapid increase in India. In the remaining countries, Pakistan produced the highest amount of manure, followed by Turkey and Iran. West Asian countries (Turkey, Iran, Syria, and Jordan) and Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Vietnam, and Myanmar) were identified as hotspots for NH3 emissions from manure.
4. Discussion
4.1. The Importance of Asia's Contribution to Global NH3 Emissions
Previous studies have presented global estimates of NH3 emissions from agricultural systems (Beusen et al., 2008; Bouwman et al., 1997; Dentener & Crutzen, 1994; Riddick et al., 2016; Sutton et al., 2013; Van Aardenne et al., 2001). In 2000, the mean estimate of global NH3 emission was 29.9 ± 5.2 Tg N yrÀ1. In this study, the estimated NH3 emission from southern Asian agricultural systems was 16.0 ± 3.0 Tg N yrÀ1, which accounted for ~55% of the total global emissions. Although gaseous NH3 has a short lifetime and low emission height (Clarisse et al., 2009), the transport of deposited NH4+ from one ecosystem to another could lead to widespread environmental pollution (Liu et al., 2013).
4.2. Comparison With Other Studies in SA
There are few regional-scale reports on NH3 emissions in SA, and large uncertainties exist in the regional estimates of NH3 emissions (Table 2). The research on NH3 emissions from Asia conducted by Zhao and Wang (1994) and Streets et al. (2003) provided comprehensive estimates in different countries in Asia. Their estimates of total NH3 emission from N fertilizer in 1990 and 2000 were 8.3 and 12.4 Tg N yrÀ1, which were 32% and 57%, respectively, higher than our estimates (Figure 2). Yan et al. (2003) provided a total estimate of NH3 emissions in South, Southeast, and East Asia in 1995 from N fertilizer use, which was 8% lower than our estimate (6.3 Tg N yrÀ1). There are two primary reasons why our estimates differ from previous estimates. First, we applied a process-based model to simulate NH3 emissions that considered environmental factors,

while the previous studies mentioned above applied an empirical EF. Second, the N fertilizer application data used in this study and previous studies were quite different. For example, the data set of N fertilizer application rates used in our estimate was developed by Lu and Tian (2017), while the data set used in Streets et al. (2003) was adopted from International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA, 1998). The comparisons of NH3 emission from N fertilizer with other studies in China and India are listed in Table 2. For NH3 emission from livestock excreta, the estimate by Yan et al. (2003) for 1995 was 4.7 Tg N yrÀ1, which was 17% lower than our estimate (5.6 Tg N yrÀ1, Figure 2). However, the estimate (10.5 Tg N yrÀ1) from Streets et al. (2003) was 29% higher than our estimate (8.1 Tg N yrÀ1) for 2000. The differences could be associated with the application of different EFs and different livestock excreta amount. In this study, we adopted a mean EF of 23% (17~29%) to estimate NH3 emissions from livestock excreta, while Yan et al. (2003) adopted the European Environment Agency (EEA) EFs based on the animal types with an average EF less than 20%. Streets et al. (2003) conceded that the use of European-based EFs in their study might have introduced uncertainty in their estimates of NH3 emission from Asian countries. Thus, future work is needed to better constrain the uncertainties associated with NH3 emission from livestock excreta. The comparisons of NH3 emission from manure with other studies in China and India are listed in Table 2.
4.3. Comparison of Monthly NH3 Emissions With Other Studies in China
The uncertainty on monthly NH3 emissions was associated with the input climate data sets, the cropland area, and N fertilizer application dates and ratios. Large uncertainties appeared in the estimate of monthly NH3 emissions from N fertilizer application (Figure S1). Similar to the result of Xu et al. (2016), NH3 emission peaked in July and was followed by secondary peaks in June and August. Our estimates of NH3 emission in September and October were different from Xu et al. (2016). Ammonia emissions in summer contributed nearly 60% of the annual total, which was consistent with the results in Zhang et al. (2011). As shown in Fu et al. (2015), NH3 emission in September was low because of the lower amount of N fertilizer application during that time of the year.
4.4. Uncertainties
Uncertainties in modeled NH3 emission are due to parameters and input data sets. Fertilizer application rates are a major factor that may have affected the accuracy of NH3 emission estimates. The input data sets of soil

properties and climate are two other important factors that might affect the spatial pattern and total amount of NH3 emissions in SA. In the DLEM, we assumed that the applied N fertilizer could be used, stored, or lost within 30 days, and these assumptions could introduce uncertainties in the simulations. In addition, DLEM used empirical methods to calculate model parameters s and g, which might result in some uncertainties due to a lack of observational data to evaluate the validity of this approach (Bash et al., 2013; Fu et al., 2015). Different N fertilizer types have different EFs and thus could result in different rates of NH3 emissions. For example, urea, a major form of N fertilizer applied to croplands in developing countries, contributed more than 50% of the total NH3 emitted from N fertilizer (Zhang et al., 2011). The EF of urea was estimated as 0.2À0.25 (Bouwman et al., 1997; Matthews, 1994). In this study, we did not differentiate between N fertilizer types. Instead, all types of N fertilizer were considered as total N inputs for model simulation and that may have reduced the accuracy of the NH3 estimates. A constant EF for NH3 emissions from manure was used in this study, which might introduce more uncertainty in our estimate compared to other studies that have used region-based or animal species-based EFs. In addition, although NH3 emissions from livestock excreta are affected by climate, soil properties, and plant phenology (Hansen et al., 2017; Massad et al., 2010), the timing and rates of animal manure application were not considered in this study. This may also have added to the uncertainty of our estimates.
4.5. Implications
More than half of the N added to croplands can be lost in various ways (Lassaletta et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2012). This study indicated that NH3 volatilization was one of the major outlets for Nr losses (Figure 1). As a significant source of NH3 and other precursor gases that lead to the generation of PM2.5, agriculture not only affects the Earth's radiation budget but causes adverse health effects (Aneja et al., 2008; Cao et al., 2009; de Leeuw et al., 2003; Fowler et al., 1998; Seinfeld & Pandis, 1998). First, NH3 can react with other air pollutants and form aerosols (e.g., PM2.5) in the atmosphere, thus lead to the reduction of visibility (Cheng et al., 2014). Second, the increasing concentration of PM2.5 is positively related to the rates of premature mortality, which increased by 21% and 85%, respectively, in East Asia and South Asia from 1990 to 2010 (Wang et al., 2017). Last, the dry and wet deposition of NH4+ from NH3 emissions may alter soil and water chemistry (e.g., eutrophication) and reduce biological diversity (Clark & Tilman, 2008; Vitousek & Farrington, 1997).
Using a global atmospheric chemistry model (Lelieveld et al., 2015), a recent study reported that outdoor air pollution, mainly by PM2.5, could lead to 3.3 (1.61À4.81) million premature deaths per year worldwide, predominantly in Asia. That study considered agriculture as the largest contributor to global premature deaths due to the releases of NH3 from livestock wastes and N fertilizer. Although Jerrett (2015) argued that Lelieveld et al. (2015) may have overestimated the toxicity of PM2.5 from agricultural sources, he suggested that scientists and policymakers should pay much more attention to PM2.5 formed by agricultural sources and its adverse effects on human health. Recently, Wang et al. (2017) indicated that reduction of NH3 emissions could maximize the effectiveness of nitrogen oxides emission controls and potentially provided some health benefits. Thus, effective farming strategies should be adopted by farmers in order to minimize NH3 loss from N fertilizer or manure application and mitigate associated threats to human health.
How can we reduce N losses from Nr? One effective strategy is to reduce the application of N fertilizer and to rotate legume crops (e.g., soybean and alfalfa) with other cereal crops (e.g., wheat and maize). Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) was found to be generally higher in agricultural systems with a higher proportion of N inputs from symbiotic N fixation (Lassaletta et al., 2014). The second strategy is to identify the optimal crop-specific N needs to avoid excessive N application to soils (Chen et al., 2011). Mueller et al. (2017) applied N input-yield response functions to investigate regional- or country-scale NUE based on the historical N budget data (1961À2009). Their studies provided an overview of the optimal N input rates in major agricultural countries and showed that East, South, and Southeast Asia received excessive N inputs up to 10 g N m2 greater than needed for optimal crop yield. The third strategy is to minimize the loss of N through improved management techniques (Bouwman et al., 1997, 2002; Chen et al., 2011, 2014; Fowler et al., 2015). In addition, some strategies have been approved to be effective for reducing N losses from animal manure in SA. For example, modifying feeding (diet with optimized N content) is an effective strategy to reduce gaseous N losses from animal manure (Chadwick et al., 2011; Hou et al., 2015). In comparison with composting, solid manure storages via compaction and covering could substantially decline NH3 emissions (Chadwick, 2005; Hou

et al., 2015). Compared to surface application, manure application through band spreading, incorporation, and injection could significantly reduce NH3 emissions (Hou et al., 2015).
Asia, whose population could increase by 0.9 billion by 2050, has been projected to be the second largest
contributor to future population growth (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs,
World Population Prospects, 2015). Valin et al. (2014) reported that food demands would increase by 59À98% between 2005 and 2050 in the reference scenario (the GDP and population pathways of the "middle of the road" Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP2) developed by the climate change impacts research community). In the projection of FAO and agriculture models, South and East Asia are expected to experience a rapid increase in crop foods and livestock products during the first half of the 21st century (Alexandratos & Bruinsma, 2012; Valin et al., 2014). Under this scenario, N fertilizer application to global croplands would dou-
ble by 2100 (Stocker et al., 2013), while manure production may increase to 50% by 2050 compared to 2000
(Bouwman et al., 2013). China and India are the top two countries with the largest N fertilizer consumption
and are expected to remain so in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, NUE has rapidly decreased in these
countries (Tian et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015). The decrease in NUE and increase in N fertilizer use would
translate into greater emission of fertilized N as NH3 and other N gases (Zhang et al., 2015). Thus, farmers as well as policymakers in Asian countries ought to consider using N fertilizer more efficiently for the benefits of environmental quality and human health (Tian et al., 2016; Zhang, 2017). Moreover, livestock excreta in SA increased from 19 to 45 Tg N yrÀ1 during 1961À2014 (Zhang et al., 2017). In 2000, Southeast, East, and South Asia contribute ~30% of global GHG emissions from ruminants (Herrero et al., 2013). In order to reduce both
GHG and NH3 emissions from livestock systems, it is important to implement an effective strategy for managing animal manure (Bouwman et al., 2013; Fowler et al., 2015).

2. Excision of Tumour on Cheek.

(Under the care of Dr. Eben Watson. Reported by T. H. Steel, M.D.)?A. M'D. was admitted a patient in ward 5 of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary on the 21st May, 1860. In January last, a small red spot formed over middle of left molar bone. Over it a round hard swelling appeared, and gradually increased in
size. About two months ago, when about the size of a hen's egg,
the skin ulcerated, and a fungoid excrescence protruded, from which haemorrhage, to a considerable extent, has repeatedly taken place. At present it is about the same dimensions, hard and painless on pressure, and nodulated on the surface j it moves on the cheek, has a narrow neck, and bleeds on being touched.
23rd?A ligature was passed round the neck of the swelling, by which it was strangulated. It was then shaved off with a knife. No bleeding took place. To have twenty drops of laudanum.
June 3rd?Continued to improve till this morning, when side of cheek and face was observed to be red and painful. Has been very sick, and complains of giddiness.
To have half an ounce of castor oil. To have thirty drops of
tincture of muriate of iron every fourth hour.

3. Excision op Tumotjb of Lip.
(Under the care of. Dr. Andrew Buchanan. Reported by Dr. Robert B. Gilland.)?L. M'K. was admitted into the Glasgow Royal Infirmary on the 21st of March. Six months ago, a small fissure on patient's lower lip first attracted his attention. He applied several ointments and lotions to it, which proved ineffectual, the disease extending, and involving more than half of the lip.
On'admission, the lower lip is swollen and indurated; thepro-
labium is dry, cracked, and ulcerated, the whole assuming the appearance of epithelial cancer.

25th?The affected portion of the lower lip was removed by a semi-elliptical incision, and then, by means of proper incisions, two flaps were taken from the side of the chin, and being brought up and secured by metallic sutures, formed a very respectable lower lip. There was a considerable ar ant of swelling afterwards, which, however, gradually subsided, and patient was dismissed curec. on the 28th of April.

4. Excision of Fatty Tumour of Shoulder.
Case I.?(Under the care of Dr. Andrew Buchanan. Reported by Dr. Robert B. Gilland.)?D. L., aged 57, was admitted into the Glasgow Royal Infirmary on the 29th May. Twelve years ago patient first observed a soft tumour, about as large as an egg, below his left shoulder. It has increased in size gradually till within the last twelvemonth, when its growth has been more rapid.
On admission, a soft moveable tumour, in size and shape resembling a female mamma, is situated upon patient's left side, between the base of the scapula and the axilla. It is generally free from pain, unless when subjected to pressure. I June 2nd?Tumour excised, and presented the usual appearances 01 a lipomatous growth.
14th?Dismissed well.
Case 11.?(U nder the care of Dr. Ehen W atson. Reported by Dr. William Sloan.)?Mrs. S., domestic, aged 41, was admitted into ward 6 of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 5th June, 1860. '?Eleven years ago, patient noticed a small tumour at the inferior angle of right scapula. It was then about the size of a pigeon's egg, and it has steadily continued to increase in size ever since, until it is now as large as a person's head. She has never experienced the slightest pain in it, and it does not inconvenience her much. Her general health has always been good.
On admission, the whole of the right scapular region is found to be occupied by a large tumour, having a rounded globular form. It has a lobulated feel, and is unconnected with any of the deeperseated structures. The integuments covering it are smooth and healthy on the surface, and are likewise found to glide over the surface of the tumour, without having any connection with it.
7th?She was submitted to a consultation this morning, when
excision was recommended.
9th?Patient was removed to the operating theatre this morning, and put under chloroform. Two longitudinal incisions were made down the whole length of the tumour, thereby leaving an oval portion of skin adherent along the central axis of the surface of the tumour. The flaps thus indicated were then reflected, and the tumour being found to be encased in a fibro-cellular sheathr was easily dissected out, without cutting or.tearing a single mus-

This chiefly came from some arterial branches which entered the tumour at its upper part, and which were easily tied. The flaps, which were found to be of the requisite size, were then brought together by means of wire sutures, and the surface from which the tumour was excised was thus exactly covered over. The patient stood the operation very well.

having interposed in its meshes a number of nucleated cells.

The other portions displayed the usual appearance of a fatty

Case III. (Under the care of Dr. Andrew Buchanan. Reported by Dr. Robert B. Gilland.)?Mrs. M., aged 45, was admitted into ward 8 of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary on the 3rd of April, 1860. Nine months ago patient first observed a small hard tumour in her left breast. It has gradually increased in size up to the pre-
sent date.
On admission, an indurated moveable tumour, about as large as the woman's closed fist, is situated in her left mamma. The general contour of the tumour is equal and rounded, but small hard prominences may be felt upon its surface. It is the seat of occasional acute pain. Close to the anterior border of the left pectoralis major muscle, another small tumour of the same character exists. It is about as large as a marble. Patient's general health good. Menstruation regular.

About a twelvemonth ago patient first observed a small hard tumour, the size of a pea, on her left breast. It has steadily increased in size, and is now occasionally painful. On examination, an indurated moveable tumour is situated below the anterior border of left pectoralis major muscle. It is as large as an egg, and irregular on the surface. Several small glands in the axilla appear to be affected. Patient, who is stout and healthy, menstruates regularly. June 11.th?Tumour excised, and presents the usual malignant

6. Excision op Hemorrhoids.

(Under the care of Dr. Eben Watson. Reported by T. H.

Steel, M.D.)?M. C. was admitted a patient in ward 5 of the

Glasgow Royal Infirmary on the 22nd of May, 1860. For six

months has been annoyed with piles, whose origin he ascribes to

long continued constipation of the bowels. Their presence cause

him muck annoyance from pain and straining in passing evacua-

tions, which are frequently bloody; the swollen membrane

becomes prolapsed, and much difficulty is often experienced in

returning it.

On examination, several red pendulous tumours are visible

external to sphincter, and internally several of much larger size

are brought to view on pressing down.

29tk?The bowels having been previously regulated, the exter-

nal piles were to-day snipped off with a pair of scissors. The

internal, after having been made to protrude, were seized singly

by a volsella, and a strong ligature passed round the base of

each, i The ends were cut short, and returned into the rectum.

No chloroform was employed.

DISEASES OF CHILDREN.
By JOHN LINDSAY STEVEN, M.D.
Gonorrhoea in Childhood. Fischer (Jahrbuch fur Kinderheilkunde, Band, xlv, Heft. 2, 3).?The vaginal secretions from fifty-nine children with vulvo-vaginitis were examined. Fifty showed the presence of the gonococcus. Thirty-six of these were under 6 years of age. The clinical signs were practically the same in all. There were intertrigo, swollen labia glued together by the purulent secretion, and urethritis. In about one-third of the cases the Bartholean glands were enlarged, suppuration of which occurred in one. The inguinal glands were frequently found enlarged. Fever was present in a very few. In fact, the subjective symptoms were few. In duration the disease is tedious. It may last for weeks or months, the urethritis continuing longer than the vaginitis. The treatment consisted of rest in bed, sitz bath with potassium permanganate, and douching with a 1 *7 per cent sol. zinc sulphate. From one-half to one pint should be used at each time. Neither the tubes nor the uterus were involved in any of the cases.?(Archives of Pediatrics, March, 1898.)
Immunity from Diphtheria conferred by Antitoxin.?There is, unquestionably, a doubt in the minds of many medical men as to the immunising power of antitoxin. Literature is certainly vague upon the important question as to how long a time safety can be assured, and by what doses. For the purpose of answering these questions, Dr. F. Gordon Morrill, in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, reports the results obtained in the Children's Hospital of Boston. Eighteen hundred and eight patients received immunising doses, about three thousand injections of antitoxin being given. The results of this experience, extending over three years, leads the author strongly to doubt the soundness of the conclusions reached by Kassowitz about two years ago. He is positive that we are able to confer immunity by promptly injecting exposed cases with an adequate dose of antitoxic serum.
The evidence presented certainly seems to bear out this belief, as the observations have been made with great care, and have been conscientiously recorded and reported. From this evidence Dr. Morill concludes that he is perfectly justified in believing?
1. That immunity in any given case, of no matter how thorough exposure to diphtheria, may be conferred, for at least ten days, by the injection of a small dose (100-250 units) of serum, provided it is given twenty-fours hours previous to actual infection.
2. That a large dose (250 units for a child of 2 years up to 500 units for one of 8 years or over) will confer safety for three weeks?or, to be a little more conservative, for twenty days?under similar conditions.
3. That no harm will result from the treatment in a vast majority of cases of sick children, and probably in no case of a healthy child, provided the serum used is up to the present standard of purity.
In the eighteen hundred cases reported, so far as bad results from the injections are concerned, the only ones in which anything like dangerous symptoms appeared were those of a boy with a splenic leucocythemia and another with nephritis. In the latter instance the antitoxin caused a distinct increase of the albuminuria and dropsy. In another case in which the same clinical symptoms were present, and the urinary analysis corresponded very closely to that of the first, the injections produced no unpleasant effects. Of the three thousand injections given, with the above exceptions, aside from an occasional urticaria, far more rare now than formerly, and an insignificant and transitory albuminuria, nothing worth noting followed them. Very rarely was the antitoxin omitted or postponed, no matter how sick the patient may have been. In one instance of very severe cerebro-spinal meningitis, in

which no injections were given, the child contracted a diphtheria which proved fatal.
In conclusion, the author expresses the opinion that a physician who fails to promptly immunise the members of a family or close community in which diphtheria breaks out, neglects to do his duty by those whose safety lies in his hands.?(Archives of Pediatrics, June, 1898.)
The Choice of Fluid for Enteroclysis in the Newly-born. Mercier (These de Paris, 1897).?Enteroclysis constitutes a rational method of treating intestinal disturbances in infants, and has also proved an efficacious one. In the case of newly-born babies half a litre of fluid should be injected at a time. Boiled water, borated water, or physiological salt solution may be used. Should the stools be very foetid a saturated solution of naphthol is valuable. Finally, if the large intestine is in an inflammatory condition, especially the lower portion, enteroclysis with starch water is indicated.? (Archives of Pediatrics, June, 1898.)
The Treatment of Articular Rheumatism by Local Applications of Salicylate of Methyl. Siredey (Journal de Clin, et de Th&r. Inf., vol. v, No. 33).?The remedy is poured, drop by drop, upon the affected part, which has previously been washed and laid upon a rubber sheet. This is wrapped about the limb, and covered with a rubber or gauze bandage. The dose is 50 to 120 drops, and its absorption is proved by chemical analysis of the urine within half an hour after the applications. The treatment may be repeated twice within twenty-four hours if the pain is very severe. No ill effects have ever been noted upon the skin, and disagreeable general symptoms are extremely rare.
It is in subacute and chronic cases of rheumatism which do not yield to salicylate of sodium that the local method is particularly applicable, and in these it produces rapid and lasting good results. It is also very easily done. In the acute cases, where several joints are involved at the same time, the doses necessary for the several applications are very large, and the handling of the limbs is very painful. For these reasons the method is scarcely to be advised in acute cases, unless the salicylic preparations cannot be taken internally. Cardiac complications in no way contra-indicate the local use of methyl salicylate.?[Archives of Pediatrics, June, 1898.)
\
The Treatment of Epidemic Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis. Bela Angyan (Memorabilien, 1898, xli, 235).?In the absence of any specific medicine, we must confine our treatment to the suppression of symptoms. Leeches allay the headache and the symptoms of irritation ; venesection is recommended by the author only in hyperacute cases, and then only in robust patients and during the first stage of the disease. A cold bath is not well borne by these patients. They are liable to collapse. A douche of cold
water for a few minutes every three or four hours over the head and nape of
the neck is recommended as very beneficial, especially in attacks of coma. Prolonged ice applications exert a prodigious antiphlogistic effect; he uses the ice-bag on the head and nape of the neck, also Chapman's tubes to the spine, but only so long as the patient feels comfortable under its application. Its effect is seen in the cessation of pain and symptoms of excitement, and frequently quiet sleep results. Treatment by mercury, which was practised on the recommendation of French physicians long ago in the form of calomel and inunctions, still retains a prominent position in the treatment of epidemic cerebro spinal meningitis. As regards symptomatic treatment, it may be said that he employs opiates in cases of the most violent excitement, in obstinate vomiting, and in intractable insomnia. They are contra-indicated in conditions of depression, in cases of somnolence, or when collapse is to be feared. The use of excitants and analeptics is confined to a narrow field, generally to cases
in which narcotics are contra-indicated.
As the brain and spinal cord are subjected to great pressure by the

accumulation of cerebro-spinal fluid in epidemic cerebro spinal meningitis. Quincke's theory that, by the removal of a portion of the cerebro-spinal fluid the brain as well as the spinal cord are released from pressure, and that the course of the disease is thus favourably influenced, seems justified. The experiments on these lines by Ziemssen, Leyden, Ketly, Fiirbringer, and others were by no means favourable to the therapeutic demands, and to Quincke's hypothesis.
Aufrecht during recent years recommended warm baths. Their favourable influence on the heart is much lauded, and the most favourable results are reported in epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis. The author confines his treatment to the application of ice-bags and the subcutaneous injections of a
corrosive sublimate solution. The sublimate makes its way at once into the
blood-current, where its action is more rapidly and more energetically obtained, and attacks the germ of infection in the role of an antimycotic remedy.
In this manner he treated six cases in 1895, twenty cases in 1896, and one case in 1897?in all, twenty-seven patients. Of these, nineteen, or 70'30 per cent, recovered. The cases belonged to the acute and subacute variety, ranging in age from 3 to 30 years. Six were females and twenty-one males. The number of injections made in the patients who recovered varied between four and twenty-four. The patients, as a rule, bear the injections very well. In one case slight salivation occurred after the fourteenth injection.
The following were the symptoms which occurred after the injection of
corrosive sublimate :?
1. As a rule, the mind of the patient cleared up after the second or third injection, the symptoms of irritation were milder, headache improved, and the patient was able to sleep.
2. After the fifth to sixth injection consciousness usually returned, and sleep became quieter and longer.
3. After seven, eight, and nine injections, the stiffness of the neck improved or even disappeared. Fever became less or ceased altogether.
4. Corrosive sublimate did not seem to prolong or shorten the course of the
disease.
Corrosive sublimate seemed to check, after a few days, the formation of inflammatory products. This was seen in those cases in which a post-mortem disclosed only few products of inflammation, and these products were of a fibrinous rather than a purulent character.?(Pediatrics, 15th June, 1898.)

This is the age for condensed manuals. Nor could we expect any other result from the rapid strides made in the various departments of surgery during the past decade. These advances have enlarged the -literature enormously in the different specialities into which surgery has been of late years
subdivided. The bewildered student turns from his ever-
increasing text-books, with their inadequate information on such subjects as those of ophthalmology and otology to special treatises, for more exact and definite, as well as more recent information. But the time required to read these, when added to that already absorbed in attention to general medicine and surgery, and the time necessarily devoted to clinical instruction and study, render it impossible for him to attempt their perusal, unless at the risk of neglecting his general work, so he lays them down in despair. Hence the demand for manuals which, while not too diffuse or abstruse, still furnish the student or junior practitioner with sufficient information to enable him intelligently to follow his teacher in the special department of the hospital, or to serve as an introduction to more extended studies, and also as safe guides in general practice. In no branch is such an assistance more required than in the science of ophthalmology. And in no department of medicine is there, perhaps, still prevailing such lamentable ignorance amongst those in general practice. Nor is this any matter for surprise, whilst the licensing bodies, with two exceptions, forbear from enforcing an attendance on an ophthalmic hospital or department during the undergraduate's
course in medicine or surgery. The work before us, the
author says, "is chiefly intended tor students attending an ophthalmic hospital." He hopes also that it may prove more than this, and be of use after the nominal studentship has ceased, as a book of reference.
We need not remind our readers how rapidly has this?the most exact of all our medical sciences?advanced during the past twenty-five years. During that period modern ophthalmology
may be said almost to have sprung into existence. Helmholtz
gave it a new birth with the ophthalmoscope. Donders was

the parent of our improved system of treatment of aber-
rations of refraction. Graefe was the sponsor to whose

genius and fostering care we owe the conception, growth, and development of such operative measures as iridectomy and linear cataract. We can hardly realise how this science has grown unless we recall what the past few years have effected in bringing it to its present state of comparative perfection. Taking up, for example, such an excellent epitome of its progress as the plainly written and lucid handbook of Dr. Swanzy, and passing over the heading of its pages, let us note a few of the most important additions of recent years. In his chapters on refraction, which follow a summary of useful hints on

" elementary optics," there are the perimetric charts of Landolt for recording the dimensions of the field of vision, and the

relative acuteness of vision for various colours in the periphery

of the field, and the tables of the same distinguished oculist,

which give the proportionate lengths of the eye in different

degrees of ametropia, both in myopia and hypermetropia. Even

with a small work like this of Mr. Swanzy's, the student has no

longer any excuse for ignorance in estimating the degree of

astigmatism, both simple and compound. A few years since,

even some ophthalmic surgeons smiled when the existence of

astigmatism was spoken of as a common source of trouble, and

the necessity for its correction was enforced by those who took

more pains to discover its presence. In chapter iii the principle

of retinoscopy and the " shadow test" is explained, and the

determination of myopia, hypermetropia or astigmatism by this

method is clearly taught. The adoption of this plan, which

saves an immensity of time and trouble in testing the eyes for

various

has

few years, become general; in fact, the use of the metrical system

of numbering lenses is comparatively of recent date. In the

treatment of diseases of the conjunctiva, chap, iv, the treatment

of granulations by electrolysis (Walpole), by jequirity (Wecker),

and the cure of pannus by the operation of peritomy, remind

us of these new and important means of cure. The transplan-

tation operations of Teale and Knapp for symblepharon,

and the transplantation of a piece of rabbit's conjunctiva

(Wolfe), are all now practised with success for this most serious

complication. Chapter vi, on diseases of the eyelids, reminds

us of the vast improvement in operations on the eyelids for the

common troubles and deformities arising out of inverted lashes.

Dianoux's, and the complete operations of Snellen and Berlin

for entropium, especially the latter ; and the ingenious operation

of Argyle Robertson for ectropium, are described in addition to

Revi ev:s.

y

other better known and more antiquated operations, and the operative steps are illustrated by excellent engravings. Of late the galvano-cautery is rightly coming into more general
use in the treatment of small mevi and various tumours of the

eyelids. Bowman's admirable suggestion for the treatment of stricture of the nasal duct and lachrymal obstruction, made

as far back as 1857, has hardly been improved on, but his subsequent employment of larger probes completed one of the most important suggestions of the many made by the veteran

English ophthalmologist.

The whole managOement of corneal ulcers has undergone a

n

?

revolution since the relative advantages of atropine and eserine
in the treatment of corneal ulceration have come to be under-

stood (chap. viii). In this particular affection, the operative step of Saemisch has become a recognised step, and we cannot point to a more telling example of the consequences of ignorance in ophthalmic practice than the daily loss of eyes, which is the result of neglect, in not carrying out this simple step in certain ulcerations of the cornea. The relation of hereditary syphilis
to corneal affections, and the evidences of this taint in the

structure of the cornea and the eye generally, as also the other concomitant evidences of its presence, have been clearly dwelt on by Mr. Hutchinson. In the improvements in surgical procedures on the cornea, we are reminded of the various operations of ablation in staphylomatous states (Wecker and Critchett), and the now familiar but ingenious device of Wecker, of tatooing in cases of leucoma.
Our author treats us to but two and a-half pages on affec-

tions of the sclerotic, and we cannot help remarking that, even at the risk of a little enlarging his handbook, he might

have been a little more generous of his thoughts and pen in parts. There is such a thing as too concentrated nutriment. However, in this pithy chapter we are reminded of the introduction of massage by Pagenstecher for painful affections of the eye, more especially rheumatic and neuralgic; and in a footnote, Mr. Swanzy describes the method of practising this therapeutical measure. In the chapter on diseases of the iris, we have the reasons assigned for the more intelligent use of atropine in iritic complications; importance rightly attached to.iridectomy, performed at the right time in cases of iritic adhesions threatening closure of the pupil; the value of the salicylates in rheumatic iritis pointed out, while the indications for mercury in affections of the iris, as well as the employment of pilocarpine to lower tension in cases of serous iritis and other hyper-exudative states are here alluded to. But we must again express regret

that this chapter of the work does not more fully enter into some of the affections of the iris which certainly deserve, even
for a student, more notice than the scant one of a few lines, while the only operation on the iris described at length is that of iridectomy, though in this section of the work, as well as in that devoted to affections of the crystalline lens, we might have anticipated detailed allusion to the operations of Critchett
and Wecker, more especially that of the latter (iritomy) in cases of closed pupil. Perhaps it is in the pathology and therapeutics of abnormal changes in the deeper tissues of
the eye that we most realise the substantial progress of
ophthalmology (chap, xi-xx), and we may thus summarise
these:?

(a.) The connection between the pathological changes in the ciliary region, the result of traumata or disease, and sympathetic

ophthalmia. (b.) The evidences of the syphilitic taint, inherited and
acquired, in choroidal or choroido-retinal morbid changes. (c.) The importance of the early recognition of sclero-choroiditis
anterior and its treatment; the early diagnosis of sarcomatous growths of the choroid.
(d.) The pathology and treatment of sympathetic ophthalmitis, and the accepted rules for the operation of enucleation in cases of injury or disease, which threaten the implication of
a sound eye.

the degree of colour blindness.
A useful chapter for the student, added by Mr. Swanzy, is that on "The Motions of the Pupil in Health and Disease," explaining the physiology of myosis and mydriasis and the action of myotics and mydriatics on the iris. In the clearer understanding of the action of the alkaloids atropia, duboisine, hyosciamine, gelsemine, eserine, and pilocarpine, and the indica-
tions for the use of these different agents in ulcers of the
cornea, glaucomatous states, after cataract and other operations, in suppurative conditions of the cornea, and in the diagnosis and treatment of myopia, important advances have been made, thanks more especially to the work of Wecker.
The author does not mention the muriate of cocaine, which
promises to be an important addition to the ophthalmologist's pharmacy, through its unquestionable power of producing local anaesthesia in certain operations on the eye. The relation of the state of the pupil to both cerebral and spinal lesions has assumed of late years a special significance. The contracted pupil of tabes dorsalis (Argyle Robertson), of general paralysis, sclerosis, aneurism, paralysis of the cervical sympathetic; the mydriatic condition which attends on growths in the cervical region or the cord, as an early symptom of tabes dorsalis, in mental derangment, in glaucomatous conditions, in diseased processes affecting the third nerve, have all been carefully differentiated, whether they are due to an irritation or a paralysis.

In the concluding chapters, on "The Orbital Muscles and Diseases of the Orbit," the operation for the advancement of the recti (Wecker) is described, and the treatment both by lenses and prisms, as also the ordinary operative measures for strabismus, are sufficiently detailed. Tumours of the orbit, malignant growths, and exophthalmic goitre, the latter affection particularly, with an account of some recent views (Fitzgerald) of its pathology, form the subject matter of the last chapter. Taking at random, as we have done from the work before us, these descriptions of some modern advances in this important science, we have instanced sufficiently the ground it covers, at the same time that readers will understand how difficult a task is that undertaken by any one who would endeavour to condense so large a subject as that of ophthalmology into a small handbook of a few hundred pages.

ABSTRACT The gut microbiota has been implicated in cancer and shown to modulate anticancer drug efficacy. Altered gut microbiota is associated with resistance to chemo drugs or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), whereas supplementation of distinct bacterial species restores responses to the anticancer drugs. Accumulating evidence has revealed the potential of modulating the gut microbiota to enhance the efficacy of anticancer drugs. Regardless of the valuable findings by preclinical models and clinical data of patients with cancer, a more thorough understanding of the interactions of the microbiota with cancer therapy helps researchers identify novel strategy for cancer prevention, stratify patients for more effective treatment and reduce treatment complication. In this review, we discuss the scientific evidence on the role of gut microbiota in cancer treatment, and highlight the latest knowledge and technologies leveraged to target specific bacteria that contribute to tumourigenesis. First, we provide an overview of the role of the gut microbiota in cancer, establishing the links between bacteria, inflammation and cancer treatment. Second, we highlight the mechanisms used by distinct bacterial species to modulate cancer growth, immune responses, as well as the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs and ICIs. Third, we demonstrate various approaches to modulate the gut microbiota and their potential in translational research. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current microbiome research in the context of cancer treatment, ongoing efforts to overcome these challenges and future perspectives.
INTRODUCTION The gut microbiota has emerged as a critical player in the maintenance of human health, influencing not only the GI tract but also distal organs such as the brain, liver and pancreas.1 2 As such, dysbiosis, which refers to compositional and functional alterations of the gut microbiome, contributes to the development of various pathological conditions, including obesity,3-5 diabetes,6-8 neurodegenerative diseases9 10 and cancers.11-14 Notably, bacterial infection can induce cancer. The colonisation of Helicobacter pylori causes persistent inflammation and leads to gastritis, driving gastric malignancy in a portion of infected individuals. Further analysis revealed that H.pylori promotes tumourigenesis via the activation of -catenin signalling pathway.15 Conversely, eradication of H.pylori decreases the risk of gastric cancer in infected individuals, supporting its role in early stages of gastric carcinogenesis.16 Likewise, colorectal cancer (CRC), the

development of cancer from the colon, is associated with specific bacteria. Recently, analysis of faecal metagenomic samples from patients with CRC identified CRC-­enriched bacteria, including Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella intermedia, Alistipes finegoldii and Thermanaerovibrio acidaminovorans, which may potentially serve as diagnostic bacterial markers across populations.17 18 The correlation of CRC-­enriched bacteria with various pathways, such as lipopolysaccharide and energy biosynthesis,17 protein and mucin catabolism, and carbohydrate degradation,18 provides insights into their functional capacity in CRC. Moreover, compelling evidence suggests that microbial shifts are highly distinct across tumour stages. Two patterns of species elevation have been reported: the first consisted of a continuous increase from early stages onwards, while the other showed elevation only in early stages. The shifts in the microbiome and metabolome occurred at early stages may provide clues for the aetiology of CRC.19 An influx of bacterial species originating from the oral cavity has been suggested to play a role in CRC pathogenesis as the gut microbiome of patients with CRC exhibits higher species richness than that of control subjects, with the expansion of oral cavity-a­ ssociated species rarely present in the healthy gut.20 In parallel, these large-s­cale, cross-­cohort studies on faecal metagenomes not only establish a link between the gut microbiome and CRC but also identify microbiome signatures for CRC that can accurately predict disease across multiple datasets.

identified by cross-­cohort studies potentially enhance non-­ invasive microbial diagnostic tests, distinguishing CRC cases from normal individuals.
Series of in vitro and in vivo studies further highlight the mechanisms used by the gut microbiota to promote tumourigenesis. Gavage of faecal samples from patients with CRC promotes colon carcinogenesis in germ-f­ree and conventional mice.21 Additional mouse models demonstrate that depleting the microbiota suppresses lung cancer development induced by Kras mutation and p53 loss.11 Bacteria have been reported to promote inflammation and cancer cell proliferation via cytokine production.11 22 Indeed, H.pylori and interleukin-22 (IL-22) induce matrix metalloproteinase-10 (MMP-10) in gastric epithelial cells via the extracellular signal-­regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. MMP-10 not only induces inflammation through the production of chemokine ligand 16 (CXCL16) and recruitment of CD8+ T cells but also damages the gastric mucosa by inhibiting tight junction proteins.22 Besides animal models, gastric organoids show that the virulence factor CagA of H.pylori associates with c-M­ et receptor and cellular proliferation.23 Together, these studies illustrate the interaction of bacteria with different components of the tumour microenvironment to promote tumourigenesis.
Chronic inflammation plays an important role in carcinogenesis and colitis-s­usceptible IL-10-d­ eficient mouse model identifies the gut microbiota as a target of inflammation that influences the progression of CRC.24 Colitis promotes tumourigenesis by altering the microbiota and inducing the expansion of bacteria with genotoxic capabilities.24 Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) has been reported to promote colon tumourigenesis by stimulating exaggerated immune responses via T helper 17 (Th17) cells in mouse CRC model.25 Gavaging mice that are prone to develop colon tumour with Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, another bacteria implicated in CRC, demonstrates that P.anaerobius not only interacts with toll-l­ike receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 on colon cells, but also promotes CRC via the modulation of various immune cell types, including myeloid-d­ erived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumour-a­ssociated macrophages (TAMs) and granulocytic tumour-a­ssociated neutrophils.26 27 Moreover, Fusobacterium nucleatum, one of the key drivers of CRC, has been shown to induce inflammatory and oncogenic responses via its virulence factors including FadA, Fap2 and LPS.28 29
In addition to its function in modulating inflammation, the microbiota influences the efficacy of cancer treatment. Preclinical data from a colon cancer mouse model identified Gammaproteobacteria as the key bacteria that metabolise gemcitabine, a chemotheraoeutic drug, into its inactive form via cytidine deaminase.30 Human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) samples also contained elevated level of Gammaproteobacteria compared with normal pancreas. Culturing the bacteria from fresh human PDAC tumours with human colon carcinoma cell lines rendered the cell lines fully resistant to gemcitabine.30 The detection of Gammaproteobacteria may explain the gemcitabine resistance in PDAC patients and targeting these bacteria may sensitise tumour to gemcitabine treatment. Collectively, these findings describe the interactions between the gut microbiota and the host, which influence the process of tumourigenesis as well as the efficacy of cancer treatment. Alexander et al proposed a `TIMER' mechanistic framework to illustrate how bacteria influence chemotherapy and the host in terms of translocation, immunomodulation, metabolism, enzymatic degradation, reduced diversity and ecological variation.31 32 The modulation of cancer immunotherapies by the microbiota has also been reported.33-37 In the following sections, we will explore
1868

the mechanisms used by distinct bacterial species to modulate the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Next, we will describe the diverse approaches that enhance cancer treatment via altering the microbiota, and discuss the potential clinical application of such approaches.
BACTERIA THAT MAY IMPROVE CANCER THERAPY EFFICACY Multiple studies demonstrate that the therapeutic efficacy was diminished in the absence of the gut microbiota, suggesting that, through different mechanisms, commensal microbes modulate the anticancer immune responses induced by the therapies. Cyclophosphamide (CTX), an approved chemotherapeutic drug, has been shown to alter the composition of intestinal microbiota in mice and promote the translocation of specific Gram-­positive bacteria into secondary lymphoid organs, stimulating the production of `pathogenic' Th17 cells, which share hallmarks of T helper 1 (Th1) cells and Th17 cells.37 38 Removal of the gut microbiota in germ-f­ree mice or mice that have been treated with antibiotics leads to drug resistance to CTX.37 On the other hand, genetic models consisting of Escherichia coli and Caenorhabditis elegans were used to elucidate the complex interactions among the host, bacteria and fluoropyrimidines, antimetabolite drugs commonly used to treat cancer.32 Bacteria modulate the efficacy of fluoropyrimidines in C.elegans via bacterial vitamin B6, B9 and ribonucleotide metabolism (figure 1). However, the role of bacteria and dietary nutrients in drug efficacy remains elusive due to the complex nature of human body influenced by intrinsic factors as well as environmental factors.
Bacteria modulate the efficacy of not only chemotherapeutic drugs but also immunotherapy. An early study on mice receiving antibiotic cocktail supports that altered microbiota impairs CpG-­ oligonucleotide immunotherapy and platinum chemotherapy. With an intact microbiota, the immunotherapy suppresses tumour growth via tumour necrosis factor (TNF) production by myeloid cells and CD8 T cell response. Conversely, antibiotic treatment impairs TNF and cytokine production by immune cells including monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, and reduces tumour regression in mice receiving immunotherapy. These findings suggest that, through TLR4 activation, commensal microbes stimulate tumour-a­ ssociated myeloid cells to produce inflammatory cytokines in response to immunotherapy and thereby improve patients' outcome.36 Deeper mechanism insights into the functions of commensal bacteria, as well as their interactions with the host, promote the design of microbial consortia that will improve the efficacy of cancer therapies.
BACTERIA THAT MAY PROMOTE CANCER GROWTH AND PROGRESSION In contrast to the commensal microbes that can boost immune cells to fight cancer, subsets of pathogenic bacteria are associated with the development and progression of tumours. Using subcutaneous and liver metastases models of pancreatic cancer, colon cancer and melanoma, Sethi et al showed that antibiotics-m­ ediated suppression of tumour growth involved adaptive immunity. This inhibitory effect was attenuated in Rag1-­knockout mice that were deficient in mature T and B cells. Mechanistically, targeting the microbiota led to increased level of interferon-­gamma (IFN-)-p­ roducing T cells and decreased level of IL-­17a- and IL-10-­producing T cells.39 Targeting the pathogenic bacteria may restore immune functions and augment the efficacy of cancer therapies.

Figure 1 Mechanisms used by gut bacteria to modulate anticancer drug efficacy. Bacterial species influence the efficacy of chemo drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors via diverse mechanisms. Bacteria modulate the efficacy of 5-F­ U via bacterial vitamin B6, B9 and ribonucleotide metabolism. Inhibiting bacterial deoxynucleotide metabolism promotes the efficacy of 5-F­ U. Barnesiella intestinihominis and Enterococcus hirae play a critical role in the antitumour effect of another chemo drug, cyclophosphamide. Removing these bacterial species results in drug resistance to cyclophosphamide. Mechanistically, E.hirae translocates from the small intestine to secondary lymphoid organs and stimulates the production of pTh17 cells, whereas B.intestinihominis accumulates in the colon and promotes the infiltration of IFN--producing T cells in cancer lesions on treatment with cyclophosphamide. In addition, Fusobacterium nucleatum acts via TLR4 and MYD88, induces a selective loss of miR-1­ 8a* and miR4802, activates autophagy and thereby promotes chemoresistance in patients. Furthermore, the antitumour effect of anti-C­ TLA-4 treatment depends on Bacteroides species. Bacteroides fragilis colonises the mucosal layer, induces T helper 1 immune responses in the lymph nodes and promotes the maturation of intratumorous dendritic cells, mediating the anticancer activity of the immune checkpoint inhibitor. 5-F­ U, 5-­fluorouracil; IFN-, interferon-g­ amma; pTh17 cells, pathogenic T helper 17 cells.

cancer,44 gastric cancer,45 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,46 and pancreatic cancer.47 Studies with cell lines and mouse models have demonstrated that FadA adhesin on F.nucleatum binds to epithelial cadherin (E-c­adherin), induces -catenin signalling and modulates inflammatory and oncogenic responses to promote tumourigenesis. Abolishing the binding of F.nucleatum to E-c­ adherin by synthetic peptide suppresses CRC cell growth. In concordance with the preclinical data, patients with CRC display an elevated level of fadA in their colon tissues compared with normal individuals. Further examination of patients' RNA revealed concomitant induction of Wnt7b and NFkB2 expression, suggesting a critical role of fadA in F.nucleatum-­induced oncogenic and inflammatory responses.28 Another mechanism used by F.nucleatum to promote cancer growth is illustrated by studies that examined the functions of immune cells in the presence of F.nucleatum. These studies revealed that Fap2 protein of F.nucleatum inhibited natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity via its interaction with T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), regulated the localisation of the bacteria to colorectal tumours and induced cell death in human lymphocytes.48-50 Besides its pro-t­umourigenic effects, F.nucleatum contributes to chemoresistance and it was enriched

in CRC patients with recurrence post-­chemotherapy.40 Mechanistically, F.nucleatum acts via TLR4 and MYD88, induces a selective loss of miR-­18a* and miR-4802, activates autophagy and thereby promotes chemoresistance in patients with CRC.40 Targeting these F.nucleatum-a­ssociated pathways may ameliorate CRC patient outcomes (figure 1).
Similar to F.nucleatum, the enrichment of P.anaerobius has been associated with CRC. P.anaerobius adheres to cancer cells but not normal colonic epithelial cells via its surface protein, putative cell wall binding repeat 2 (PCWBR2), which interacts with 2/1 integrin expressed on colonic cells, and subsequently activates PI3K-A­ kt pathway, promoting cell proliferation as well as inflammation via nuclear factor kappa-l­ight-c­hain-­enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) cascade. With the reported functions of P.anaerobius in promoting cell proliferation and in triggering a proinflammatory tumour microenvironment via the recruitment of tumour-i­nfiltrating MDSCs and TAMs,27 efforts should be directed to examining the effect of this bacterial species on chemotherapies and cancer immunotherapies.
Furthermore, radiotherapy exerts potent immune modulatory effect via tumour-a­ssociated antigen cross-­presentation to cytolytic CD8+ T cells and IFN-.51 A study using melanoma

and lung cancer models revealed that vancomycin, an antibiotic targeting Gram-­positive bacteria, potentiated the radiotherapy-­ induced antitumour response in mice by increasing CD8+ T cell infiltration and IFN- expression, whereas the supplementation of sodium butyrate, a key metabolite of Gram-p­ ositive bacteria, abolished the effect.51 The level of Gram-­positive bacteria potentially influences patient's response to radiotherapy.
MICROBIAL BIOMARKERS FOR THERAPY EFFICACY The antitumour immune response of CTX has been shown to be enhanced by several bacterial species, such as Lactobacillus johnsonii, Enterococcus hirae and Barnesiella intestinihominis, identified by mouse models.37 52 Mechanistically, E.hirae translocates from the small intestine to secondary lymphoid organs and increases the intratumorous CD8/Treg ratio, whereas B.intestinihominis accumulates in the colon and promotes the infiltration of IFN--producing T cells in cancer lesions. Oral gavage with E.hirae restores the antitumour effect of CTX, which is otherwise ablated by antibiotics treatment. Additional mouse model identified nucleotide-b­inding oligomerisation domain-­ containing protein 2 as an inhibitor for the activity of E.hirae and B.intertinihominis.52
Similarly, the antitumour effect of anti-­cytotoxic T-­lymphocyte-­ associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) treatment depends on distinct Bacteroides species. Germ-­free and antibiotics-t­reated mice do not respond to anti-C­ TLA-4 treatment; however, gavaging these mice with Bacteroides fragilis induces Th1 immune responses in the lymph nodes and promotes the maturation of intratumorous dendritic cells, restoring their response to CTLA blockade. Similar observation in patients reveals that the efficacy of CTLA-4 antibody is associated with T cell responses mediated by B.fragilis or Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.35 In addition, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum and several other species have been reported to augment dendritic cell function, and thereby induce CD8+ T cell priming and accumulation in the tumour microenvironment.33 34 The supplementation of these bacterial strains may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of ICIs in patients with cancer . Furthermore, bacteria have been shown to suppress melanoma growth by attenuating the unfolded protein response (UPR) signalling pathway and mediating antitumour immunity. Mice lacking the ubiquitin ligase RNF5 exhibit an altered gut microbiota that correlates with decreased expression of UPR but increased expression of inflammasome components. Transfer of 11 bacterial strains enriched in Rnf5-/- mice promotes antitumour immunity and represses melanoma growth in germ-­free wild-­type mice.53 In accordance with the mouse data, patients that respond to immune checkpoint therapy exhibit significantly reduced level of UPR components.53 Modulation of selective bacterial species may enhance cancer immunotherapy and improve the outcomes of non-­responders.
Complementing the preclinical mouse models, studies in patients highlight potential use of the gut microbiota in predicting treatment outcome. Analysing the faecal microbiota composition of metastatic melanoma (MM) patients receiving ipilimumab, an ICI targeting CTLA-4, revealed that patients with enriched level of Faecalibacterium and other Firmicutes were associated with not only longer survival but also increased occurrence of ipilimumab-­induced colitis.54 Similar to CTLA-4, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is one of the inhibitory receptors which downregulate effector functions and suppress immune response. PD-1 blockade leads to significant tumour regression in a subset of patients with cancer.55-59 A metagenomic analysis of faecal samples from non-small cell lung cancer
1870

(NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients receiving anti-P­ D-1 treatment indicated that non-r­esponders had reduced levels of Akkermansia muciniphila, which had been shown to promote the recruitment of CCR9+CXCR3+CD4+ T lymphocytes to the tumour microenvironment via IL-12 pathway.60 On the other hand, two studies in patients with melanoma validated the presence of commensal microbes that potentiated the antitumour effects of PD-1 blockade in responders.61 62 Notably, responders display a higher alpha diversity and enriched levels of Ruminococcaceae and Faecalibacterium, which are associated with enhanced antigen presentation and T cell function in the tumour microenvironment.61 Taken together, a ratio of `beneficial' bacteria to `non-­beneficial' bacteria is suggested to predict clinical response.62 Importantly, different cancer types, cancer treatments (chemotherapy vs immunotherapy), sample types (stool vs tissue) and approaches used to determine the microbial profile (16S vs metagenomic sequencing) may lead to biases and subsequently the identification of different species as beneficial bacteria. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, for instance, plays a conflicting role in inflammation. F.prausnitzii has been associated with improved clinical response to immune checkpoint blockade,54 63 but it has also been shown to mitigate intestinal inflammation in the context of inflammatory bowel disease.64 With its ability to produce short-­chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which induce Treg cells and IL-10, F.prausnitzii would not be expected to promote anticancer immune responses. However, a recent study demonstrated that SCFAs enhanced memory potential of activated CD8+ T cells, suggesting that F.prausnitzii may potentiate antitumour immune response by promoting CD8+ T cells' long-t­erm survival as memory cells.65
Likewise, pathogenic bacteria can also serve as diagnostic or prognostic markers. Metagenomic data of patients with cancer indicated that F.nucleatum was enriched in CRC tissues compared with normal tissues.19 66 67 Not only does the level of F.nucleatum increase with the degree of malignancy,40 but it also associates with metastasis.68 69 Further study of 309 subjects showed that complementing the faecal immunochemical test (FIT) with the detection of F. nucleatum improved diagnostic performance of FIT in colon cancer screening.70 Additional analysis of human CRC cohorts unveils other features of F.nucleatum-­associated CRC, including right-­ sided colon location, CpG island methylation phenotype-­high (CIMP-H­ ), high level of microsatellite instability (MSI-H­ ) and poor prognosis.71-73 CRC with MSI-­high status generally harbour numerous mutations and generate immunogenic peptides because of mismatch-­repair deficiency. These alterations encourage antitumour immune response, leading to a more favourable prognosis and better response to immunotherapies. Considering these effects of MSI status, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of anti-­PD1 antibodies, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, for CRC with high-­MSI status. Interestingly, a study on 1041 patients with rectal and colon cancer demonstrated that the association of F.nucleatum with tumour-­infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) differed by tumour MSI status. The presence of F.nucleatum was negatively associated with TIL in MSI-h­ igh tumours, but positively associated with TIL in non-­MSI-h­igh tumours. The differential association of F.nucleatum with immune cells due to tumour MSI status suggests that F.nucleatum interacts with MSI status to mediate immune response within tumour.74 The F.nucleatum-­ induced changes in immune response influence cancer patients' treatment outcome and overall survival. Despite these observations in patients with cancer that strongly suggest the use of F.nucleatum as a prognostic marker, the relationships between

F.nucleatum and methylation status of tumours, F.nucleatum and the right-­sided colon location remain to be elucidated.
In addition to CRC, recent studies on liver cancer75 and pancreatic cancer1 2 39 have elucidated the mechanisms used by bacteria to modulate immune profile and the efficacy of cancer treatment. Pushalkar et al demonstrated that human and mouse PDAC exhibited distinct bacterial composition compared with normal pancreas. Bacterial ablation with antibiotics reprogrammed the PDAC tumour microenvironment and enhanced the efficacy of ICI by reducing the level of MDSCs, inducing M1 macrophage differentiation and promoting CD8+ T cell activation.2 A recent study on liver cancer also delineated the mechanism used by bacteria to diminish antitumour immunity in the liver. Using multiple mouse models, Ma et al identified Clostridium species as important players in the regulation of bile acids, which in turn influenced the production of the chemokine CXCL16 by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. CXCL16 recruits natural killer T (NKT) cells to the tumour, thereby inhibiting the growth of primary and metastatic liver cancer.75 In accordance with the preclinical data, bile acids were correlated with CXCL 16 expression in human liver sinusoidal endothelial cell line and in non-­tumour liver tissues from patients with liver cancer. Targeting Clostridium species may restore antitumour immunity in the liver and suppress tumour growth.75
MODULATION OF CANCER THERAPY-ASSOCIATED TOXICITIES BY THE MICROBIOTA GI surgery, including preoperative cleansing with oral and intravenous antibiotics, alters the microbiota and may lead to complications such as infection and anastomotic leakage.76 77 These complications may be ameliorated by modulating the microbiota as evidence suggests that specific bacteria, including Lactobacillus spp and A. muciniphila, regulate intestinal wound healing process via reactive oxygen species-d­ependent and formyl peptide receptors-­dependent mechanisms.76 78 79 A study using germ-f­ree mice colonised with B. thetaiotaomicron also indicated the bacteria' function in regulating the expression of genes involved in nutrient absorption, mucosal barrier fortification and angiogenesis.80 In contrast to these beneficial bacteria that maintain intestinal function and epithelial integrity, pathogenic bacteria, such as Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, promote the development of anastomotic leakage.81 82 Therefore, selective inhibition of pathogens and simultaneous preservation of `good' bacteria prior to or after surgery may minimise the risk of complications.
Similar to surgery, treatment with ICIs can result in adverse events including colitis. Metagenomic sequencing revealed that certain bacteria display altered profile in patients with cancer suffering from checkpoint-b­lockade-i­nduced colitis. Of note, elevated level of Bacteroidetes and microbial genetic pathways involved in polyamine transport and B vitamin biosynthesis were shown to be associated with resistance to the development of colitis in patients with cancer receiving ipilimumab. The identified microbial biomarkers may predict patients' risk of developing ipilimumab-i­nduced colitis.83 Supplementation of a cocktail of bacteria, including Bacteroidales and Burkholderiales, and faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) treatment have been shown to ameliorate ICI-i­nduced colitis in antibiotic-t­reated mice and in cancer patients respectively.35 84 Although FMT reduces inflammation and ulceration with fewer side effects than corticosteroids, anti-­TNF and anti-­integrin agents, the extremely small sample size of the study and lack of mechanistic insight call for extensive validations.84

Recent advances in basic science
Analysis of the faecal samples of patients receiving radiotherapy suggested that patients with radiation enteropathy showed lower bacterial diversity but enrichment of specific microbial taxa, including Clostridium IV and Roseburia.85 FMT has been shown to alleviate radiation-­induced GI toxicity and increase the survival rate of irradiated mice by improving GI tract function and epithelial integrity. Notably, FMT thickens the mucus layer of irradiated mice by upregulating the expression of Muc2, Glut1 (Slc2a1), Pgk1, intestinal trefoil factor (TFF3/ITF1) and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1). FMT also ameliorates radiation-i­nduced bone marrow toxicity. Compared with FMT or bone marrow transplant alone, the combination treatment significantly increases the survival rate of irradiated mice,86 suggesting that FMT may serve as a radioprotector to improve prognosis of patients with cancer receiving radiotherapy.
In spite of its protective effect against cancer therapy-i­nduced toxicities, FMT is associated with risks. Pathogens may be transmitted to the recipients via FMT. As such, robust microbiological screening is essential for abrogating the risk of transferring known pathogens, especially the ones carrying antimicrobial resistance. Nonetheless, it remains challenging to identify conditions for which FMT has true clinical potential. Limited data and knowledge on the role of FMT in cancer prevent the prediction of patient's response to FMT. Further analysis of the microbial profile of donors and recipients, as well as the associated mechanistic insights, is crucial for effective FMT treatment in patients.87
BACTERIA DEPLETION BY ANTIBIOTICS OR OTHER MEANS Given their contribution to tumourigenesis, carcinogenic bacteria have been depleted by various means to prevent cancer or delay tumour growth. Among these pathogens, H. pylori's role in gastric tumourigenesis is well-e­stablished.88 89 Eradication of H. pylori by a combination of amoxicillin and clarithromycin in patients with early gastric cancer is associated with lower rates of developing metachronous gastric cancer and improvements in the grade of glandular atrophy at the corpus.90 Conversely, an analysis of 125441 cancer cases and 490510 control cases indicated that antibiotic treatment positively correlated with cancer risk.91 92 Antibiotics have also been associated with reduced survival in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma receiving anti-p­ rogrammed cell death ligand-1 (PD-­L1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) monotherapy,93 suggesting that the removal of commensals undermines the efficacy of ICIs.
The conventional use of antibiotics alters the commensal microbiota, leading to collateral damage to patients. Novel technologies, such as CRISPR-C­ as9 system delivered by phage,94 95 targeting specific bacteria at the microbiome-cancer interface are needed to minimise perturbation to the commensal microbiota, and to ensure effective cancer treatment. Notably, administration of irinotecan-l­oaded dextran nanoparticles covalently linked to azide-m­ odified phages that target F.nucleatum in the tumours augments the effect of chemotherapy against CRC. The phage treatment is restricted to GI tumours, reducing potential toxicities associated with therapy.96 Ongoing clinical trials have proven the utility of nanoparticles in drug delivery with increasing number of nanomedicines being approved for various indications.97
Nanotechnologies can be used to target tumour-a­ssociated bacteria or to release anticancer drugs in a controlled manner, causing fewer side effects in patients.98 99 Given the implications of nanotechnologies for cancer prevention and treatment, efforts
1871

should be directed to evaluating toxicity, side effects and downstream mechanisms mediated by nanoparticles.
BACTERIA COMPOSITIONAL MODULATION BY PROBIOTICS IN CANCER Numerous clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the effects of probiotics/prebiotics on cancer. Some trials100-103 reported an improved clinical outcome of patients receiving probiotics, whereas others104 105 failed to examine a significant effect induced by probiotics (online supplementary S table 1).
A prospective intervention study on patients with CRC revealed that the administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium lactis Bl-04 altered patients' microbial profile. The probiotics increased the abundance of butyrate-­producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium and Clostridiales spp, while decreasing the abundance of CRC-­associated genera, including Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus.106 In addition to altering the microbial profile, probiotics have been reported to inhibit cancer progression in animal models. Using a diethylnitrosamine (DEN) model of rat hepatocarcinogenesis, Zhang et al demonstrated that the administration of the probiotic mixture VSL#3 mitigated intestinal inflammation on DEN treatment, maintained the intestinal mucosa integrity and suppressed tumour growth.107 A subsequent study demonstrated that the probiotic mixture Prohep reduced the level of Th17 cells in the tumour, thereby inhibiting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression in a subcutaneous transplant mouse model.108 Clinical trials assessing the therapeutic potential of VSL#3 in patients with cirrhosis109 or non-­alcoholic fatty liver disease110 suggested that probiotics improved the severity of the diseases that are strongly linked to the development of HCC.111
Recently, a study by Riehl et al delineated the mechanism of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) radioprotection. Tumour-­ bearing mice were treated with phosphate buffered saline alone, irradiation alone, LGG alone or LGG followed by irradiation. The result demonstrated that LGG releases lipoteichoic acid (LTA), which binds to TLR2 on pericryptal macrophages and promotes chemokine CXCL12. CXCL12 in turn binds to CXCR4 on cyclo-­oxygenase-2 expressing mesenchymal stem cells, driving their migration to the pericryptal region and producing prostaglandin E2 that protects epithelial stem cells from radiation-i­nduced apoptosis.112 Yet, this mechanism remains to be validated in human.
In addition to radioprotection, probiotics may manipulate host inflammatory status, thereby influencing the efficacy of cancer therapy.113 Several clinical trials, however, deny the clinical benefits of probiotics in cancer treatment.114 115 Treating patients with head and neck cancer with a cocktail of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains after surgery did not improve the clinical outcome of patients. Patients receiving the probiotics and those receiving the placebo had similar rate of postoperative infection and displayed comparable level of inflammatory markers and diamine oxidase, an indicator of gut permeability.104 The conflicting results of clinical trials may be explained by interindividual variations in microbiome and host genome. Colonisation and function of probiotics are influenced by indigenous microbiota, gene-e­ xpression profile of the host and other exogenous factors.116-118 Due to these variations, it remains challenging to assess the clinical benefits of probiotics in patients with cancer. In addition, the majority of the clinical trials on probiotics shares limitations, such as small sample size, short duration of treatment and lack of follow-­up to examine the long-t­erm effect of probiotics on patients. Therefore, well-d­ esigned studies are

critical for the evaluation of probiotic treatment in patients with cancer. Interestingly, a recent study investigated the effects of 11-s­train probiotics or autologous faecal microbiome transplantation (aFMT) on post-­antibiotic reconstitution of mouse and human microbiota. The result indicated that probiotics significantly delayed microbiome reconstitution, while aFMT induced a rapid and near-c­omplete recovery within days of administration. On the basis of this finding, aFMT, instead of probiotics, may be used to reconstitute the microbiome in antibiotics-­ perturbed patients.116
ORGANOIDS PROVIDE DEEPER MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS INTO THE ROLE OF THE GUT MICROBIOTA IN CANCER Organoids cultured from pluripotent stem cells or tissues maintain many characteristics of their respective tissues, including histology and expression of markers.119 With these properties, organoids are adopted for disease modelling and drug screening.120 Organoids overcome drawbacks of current studies using cell lines or mouse models, including limited access to human samples and intrinsic differences between mouse models and human physiology.121 The addition of bacteria to organoid culture allows the study of host-bacteria interactions and offers a deeper mechanistic insight than two-d­ imensional culture.
A study confirmed the pro-­tumourigenic effect of H.pylori via microinjection of the bacteria into human gastric organoids. The CagA protein of H.pylori binds to the c-M­ et receptor of organoid epithelial cells, phosphorylates c-M­ et and promotes epithelial cell proliferation.23 Moreover, human monocyte-­ derived dendritic cells (DCs) were cocultured with gastric organoids and subsequently exposed to H.pylori. The result showed that DCs migrated to and interacted with gastric epithelial organoids and their migration was enhanced by H.pylori infection.122 This coculture system recapitulated what happened in vivo during a bacterial infection. DCs are recruited to the gastric mucosa on H.pylori infection to promote phagocytosis of H.pylori. Furthermore, fusion of organoids and coculture of multiple organoids has recently been proposed to enhance the structural complexity and functional maturation of organoids.123 124 Clinically, patient-­derived organoids may be used for predicting tumour's sensitivity to various therapies.
FUTURE PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSIONS With advances in sequencing technology and development of powerful computational tools, the research paradigm has shifted from association-b­ ased approach to mechanism-b­ ased approach. The mere presence or absences of certain bacterial species provides limited insight into the role of the gut microbiota in cancers. Indeed, unravelling causal links between bacteria and cancers, as well as the underlying mechanisms, has become the focus of intense research. Moreover, altered viromes and fungal microbiota have been implicated in CRC,125 126 suggesting that these microorganisms may interact with gut bacteria to modulate patients' response to cancer treatment. The integrated analysis of the gut microbiome and its interactions with the host, anticancer drugs and other exogenous factors127-129 is essential for improving the outcomes of cancer patients (online supplementary S table 2).
Gnotobiotic animal models have been widely used to examine the colonisation of specific bacterial species in the gut and their biological functions in the context of cancer, and to provide the proof of principle needed to direct and interpret human studies.24 130 However, differences in physiology of the intestinal tract, dietary patterns and genetics suggested that the mouse

Figure 2 Preclinical mouse models and sequencing data of patients with cancer are valuable tools in microbiome research that contribute to the development of novel therapeutics for patients with cancer. Preclinical mouse models are valuable tools to dissect the mechanisms of defined bacteria in the absence of microbes (germ-­free mice) or in the presence of limited number of microbes (antibiotic treatment). However, limitations, such as selection bias, prevent these preclinical models from fully recapitulating the interactions between the gut microbiota and cancer cells in humans. The antibiotic treatment may select for resistant bacteria or promote fungal outgrowth, confounding the result of the experiment. Other factors, including the housing environment, the diet and the genetic background of the mice, also influence the microbial communities residing in the mice and their interaction with tumour cells or anticancer drugs. To complement these preclinical models, cancer patients' sequencing data are examined in terms of the host genome, metabolome and immune profile before and after anticancer treatment. Together, the mouse models and meta-a­ nalysis of human sequencing data provide insights into the relationship between the gut microbiota and cancer treatment. Modulating the gut microbiota by selectively targeting cancer-­associated bacteria with phages, by administering probiotics or by performing FMT, may reshape the tumour microenvironment and the host immune responses, thereby augmenting the efficacy of anticancer drugs and improving the outcome of cancer patients.

microbiota differs significantly from the human microbiota.131 132 Reproducibility of mouse microbiota studies and their conclusions are to be interpreted with caution, and the findings are to be validated extensively by large-s­cale, multicentred clinical trials. Collaborative efforts to elucidate the role of the gut microbiota in shaping responses to cancer therapy are evident in several ongoing trials that evaluate the effect of FMT in patients with cancer who are impervious to ICIs. The teams conducting these trials propose that non-­responders lack beneficial bacteria that are critical for the antitumour effect of immunotherapy, and that transplanting these bacteria from responding patients to non-­responders restore their response to ICIs (NCT04130763, NCT04116775, NCT03353402, NCT03341143). These trials, along with further validations, will determine if selective modulation of gut microbiota, either by FMT, probiotic treatment or other means, enables patients with cancer to overcome resistance to immune checkpoint therapy (figure 2).
Accumulating evidence has underscored the critical role of the gut microbiota in cancer therapies. Some bacterial species are essential for the antitumour effect of cancer treatment,
Cheng WY, et al. Gut 2020;69:1867-1876. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2020-321153

whereas other species attenuate the efficacy of cancer drugs via diverse mechanisms. Given the relationships between host, gut microbiota and cancer treatments, research efforts have been directed to investigate the mechanisms used by bacteria to modulate patients' response to treatment and their clinical outcomes. In this review, we explored the dynamic interactions between the host, the gut microbiota and various cancer treatments, including chemotherapies and immunotherapies. Regardless of the recent advances in the field of microbiome research, limitations of current research hamper the clinical applications of bacterial therapies. Of note, strong associations between distinct bacterial species and cancers have been established, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive and need extensive validation via preclinical models and clinical trials. Nonetheless, recent findings supported the potential of microbial markers or enterotypes133 in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, the potential of phage therapies in targeted delivery of cancer drugs, and the potential of FMT or probiotics in remodelling the tumour microenvironment or in potentiating antitumour immunity. The role of the microbiota in cancer is context-­dependent. Bacteria

interact with a plethora of host, as well as exogenous factors in patients with cancer and influence tumourigenesis via diverse mechanisms. Overall, a more comprehensive understanding of the functions of distinct bacteria in host physiology and in cancer treatment is critical to the development of personalised medicine that enhances patients' response to cancer therapies by modulating the gut microbial composition and function.

How To Maintain Maximal Straight Path Running Speed on a Curved Path in Sprint Events

by Hayato Ohnuma1, Masanobu Tachi2, Akihito Kumano3, Yuichi Hirano4

This study aims to clarify the ideal technique for running on a curved path during sprinting events. Participants were twelve male track and field athletes including long jumpers and sprinters. The participants performed a 60-m sprint with maximal effort on straight and curved paths. Participants were divided into "good curve runners" and "poor curve runners" according to the curved path running speed relative to that of the straight path. Kinematic variables and ground reaction forces (GRFs) were registered and compared between the groups and paths. The running speed, step length, and flight distance of the outside leg on the curved path were lower than on the straight path only in poor curve runners. The medial-lateral GRF and impulse showed an increase during curved path running for both groups. However, the maximum posterior GRF and impulse decreased only in poor curve runners. The ideal technique for running on a curved path is to maintain the same kinematics and kinetics in the sagittal plane as on a straight path.
Key words: curved path, running technique, maximal running speed, sprinting.

Introduction
In sprinting events, maximal running speed largely affects sprint performance (Mackala, 2007). Previous studies have clarified some biomechanical factors that contribute to improving the running speed on a straight path (Brughelli et al., 2011; Hunter et al., 2004; Morin et al., 2012; Nummela et al., 2007; Weyand et al., 2000). In sprinting events, except for the 100-meter dash, 110-meter hurdles, and 100-meter hurdles, sprinters should run on both straight and curved paths at maximum or near maximum running speed. Therefore, to enhance sprint performance in most sprinting events, it is important to improve running speed on both straight and curved paths. However, it is generally accepted that the running speed on curved paths tends to be slower than on straight paths (Chang and Kram, 2007; Churchill et al., 2015a, 2015b; Greene, 1985; Stoner and Ben-Sira, 1979; Usherwood and Wilson, 2006).

Some previous studies attempted to clarify the reason for this detrimental effect of a curved path on maximal running speed. Stoner and Ben-Sira (1979) compared 20-m straight path and curved path running and indicated that on curved paths, the running speed was slower, and the spatiotemporal variables differed between legs. Usherwood and Wilson (2006) demonstrated that the main factor limiting the running speed on curved paths was an increase of the stance phase. The ground reaction force during curved and straight paths has been compared in previous studies (Chang and Kram, 2007; Churchill et al., 2015b; Hamill et al., 1987; Luo and Stefanyshyn, 2012; Smith et al., 2006). These studies showed that on a curved path, the ground reaction force differed between legs. The vertical ground reaction force tended to decrease in the leg that was inside during curved path running. However, the mediolateral component of the horizontal

How to maintain maximal straight path running speed on a curved path in sprint events

ground reaction force of the inside leg was greater than of the outside leg.
These previous studies aimed to reveal the differences in sprint movement between straight and curved paths, and to clarify the factors that affected the running speed on curved paths. Most of the studies consistently showed that the running speed on a curved path was slower than on a straight path. On the other hand, Alt et al. (2015) indicated that there were no significant differences in running speed between straight and curved paths. Therefore, the extent of the decline in maximum running speed on a curved path in relation to a straight path differs among runners, i.e., there are good curve runners and poor curve runners. Running speed on a curved path is considered to be determined by maximum running speed or sprint ability on the straight path, and the cornering technique to change direction of movement along the curve without decreasing running speed. Therefore, knowledge of the differences in biomechanical characteristics between good and poor curve runners could lead to a better understanding of the technique for running faster on curved paths during sprinting events.
By comparing the differences in biomechanical characteristics between good and poor curve runners, this study aimed to clarify the ideal technique for running on a curved path during sprinting events.
Methods
Participants Twelve male track and field athletes
including long jumpers and sprinters (age 20.3 ± 0.9 years, body height 1.74 ± 0.04 m, body mass 66.7 ± 4.6 kg) volunteered for this study. None of the participants reported any musculoskeletal injuries at the time of testing. Approval to undertake this study was given by the Nara University of Education Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Measures
The trials were 60 m sprint running on straight and curved paths. This experiment was conducted in the laboratory with all-weather pavement. Detrimental effects of curvature on running speed tend to be larger on a small radius (Greene, 1985; Quin, 2009). The radius of

curvature was 37.9 m, which corresponds to the most inside lane of a typical 400-m track. Reflective markers were placed on body landmarks based on Plug-in-Gait protocols (Davis et al., 1991; Kadaba et al., 1990). The measurement section was 45 m from the start on both paths. Three-dimensional positional data of the markers were recorded using a motion capture system operating at 250 Hz with 15 infrared cameras (Vicon-MX, Oxford Metrics Ltd., Oxford, UK). Two force-plate systems (Type 9286B, Kistler Inc., Winterthur, Switzerland) were used to sample ground reaction force (GRF) data at 1000 Hz. The positional data and GRF data were synchronized using Vicon Nexus software (ver. 1.7.1, Oxford Metrics Ltd., Oxford, UK). In this study, we used only two force-plate systems. Therefore, the kinematic data and GRF data for each leg were obtained in separate trials. The participants performed 8 trials, two for each leg and path during the same days. Between trials, participants rested for more than ten minutes to offset the effect of fatigue on running speed. Global coordinate system directions were set as X-axis for the medial-lateral direction, Y-axis for the anterior-posterior direction, and Z-axis for the vertical direction. On a curved path, the global coordinate system was translated to a local coordinate system in which the X-axis was defined as a radial-to-curved path, and the Y-axis was a tangential-to-curved path. Procedures
Vicon Nexus software was used to reconstruct the positions of each reflective marker in a three-dimensional graphical environment. Every marker on the participant was labeled according to the body landmark to which it was attached or according to the cluster to which it belonged, based on Plug-in Gait-protocols. The positional data and GRF data were smoothed using a fourth-order Butterworth digital filter with cutoff frequencies of 12 and 50 Hz, respectively. The center of gravity was calculated using body segment variables, which were based on Jensen's mathematical modeling of Japanese athletes (Ae et al., 1992). The lower limb angle and angular velocity were calculated from these threedimensional coordinate values. Kinematic and GRF data of the fastest trial for each leg and each path were used for detailed analyses. All data processing was performed using MATLAB

software (R2013a, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Spatiotemporal variables
Spatiotemporal variables were calculated for left and right steps on both paths. In accordance with previous studies (Churchill et al., 2015a, 2015b; Stoner and Ben-Sira, 1979), a right (outside) step was defined from right foot touchdown to left foot touchdown and vice versa for a left (inside) step. Running speed for each path was calculated by averaging the running speed for inside and outside steps. Participants were separated into good or poor curved path running groups based on the running speed on the curved path relative to the straight path. Lower limb movements
Lower limb movements in the sagittal plane during the stance phase were calculated for left and right steps on both paths. Lower limb joint angles on foot touchdown and foot takeoff, minimum knee and ankle joint angles, and maximum lower limb joint flexion (dorsiflexion) and extension (plantarflexion) angular velocities were estimated. Ground reaction force
The maximum and minimum GRF and the impulse for each coordinate were calculated for left and right steps. The impulse of the anterior-posterior component was divided into eccentric and concentric phases (Mero and Komi, 1986). Statistical analysis
The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare body characteristics and analyze variables between good and poor groups. In addition, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to separately identify significant differences between straight and curved path running. For multiple comparisons, we used a Bonferroni correction to set the significance level at p < 0.05, and Cohen's d was used to describe effect size (Cohen, 1992). All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics software (v. 22.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).
Results
The division of participants into good and poor curve runners
Figure 1 shows the running speed of all participants on straight and curved paths. The participants were equally divided into good and

poor curved path running groups based on the percent difference of the running speed on both paths. In addition, percent difference of the running speed in the poor curved path running group was lower than in the good curved path running group (p < 0.01, d = 5.82). There were no significant differences in body characteristics between groups (Good: body height 1.72 ± 0.02 m, body mass 64.9 ± 2.5 kg; Poor: body height 1.77 ± 0.06 m, body mass 67.6 ± 5.9 kg). Spatiotemporal variables
Table 1 shows the spatiotemporal variables for each leg and path. The running speed on the curved path was slower than on the straight path in the poor curved path running group (p = 0.03, d = 1.24). The step frequency, stance time, and flight time did not differ between the groups or the paths. However, step length (p = 0.03, d = 1.32) and flight distance (p = 0.03, d = 1.42) of the outside leg on the curved path were significantly lower than on the straight path in poor curve runners. There were no significant differences in spatiotemporal variables between the groups. Lower limb movements
Table 2 shows the lower limb movements for each leg during stance phases. There were no significant differences in lower limb movements during the flight phase between the paths and groups during the flight phase. During the stance phase, the hip joint angle at foot release for the outside leg (p = 0.03, d = 0.79) on the curved path was significantly smaller than on the straight path in poor curve runners. Furthermore, minimum knee (p = 0.03, d = 0.93) and ankle joint angles (p = 0.03, d = 2.26), and maximum knee joint extension angular velocity (p = 0.03, d = 0.30) of the inside leg on the curved path were significantly smaller and faster than on the straight path in the poor curve runners. On the other hand, the hip joint angle at foot contact for both legs on the curved path was significantly smaller than on the straight path in both groups (Good Inside leg: p = 0.03, d = 0.79; Good Outside: p = 0.03, d = 0.32; Poor Inside: p = 0.03, d = 0.79; Poor Outside: p = 0.03, d = 0.57). There were no significant differences in lower limb movements during the stance phase between the two groups. Ground reaction force

On the other hand, the maximum posterior GRF (p = 0.03; d = 0.92) and the impulse (p = 0.03, d = 2.14) for the outside leg on the curved path were significantly lower than on the straight path in the poor curved runners group. Additionally, the maximum (Good-inside: p = 0.03; d = 3.78; Goodoutside: p = 0.03; d = 2.32; Poor-inside: p = 0.03; d = 2.56; Poor-outside: p = 0.03; d = 1.78) and minimum medial GRF (Good-inside: p = 0.03; d =

2.61; Good-outside: p = 0.03; d = 1.39; Poor-inside: p = 0.03; d = 2.65; Poor-outside: p = 0.03; d =1.47) and the impulse (Good-inside: p = 0.03; d = 4.92; Good-outside: p = 0.03; d = 3.56; Poor-inside: p = 0.03; d = 2.96; Poor-outside: p = 0.03; d = 1.88) for both legs on the curved path were significantly greater than on the straight path in both groups. There were no significant differences in GRF during the stance phase between the two groups.

Discussion
Previous studies have shown that running speed on a curved path is slower than on a straight path. However, the extent of the loss in maximum running speed on a curved path differs among runners, i.e., there are good and poor curve runners. By comparing the differences in biomechanical characteristics between good and poor curve runners, this study aimed to clarify the ideal technique for running on curved paths during sprinting events.
In this study, participants were separated into good and poor curved path running groups based on running speed on a curved path relative to that on a straight path. The results suggested that running speed on a curved path was significantly slower than on a straight path in poor curve runners. However, there were no significant differences between straight and curved path running speed in good curve runners. Previous studies (Chang and Kram, 2007; Churchill et al., 2015a, 2015b; Greene, 1985; Stoner and Ben-Sira, 1979; Usherwood and Wilson, 2006) have shown that running speed on a curved path is slower than on a straight path. Additionally, this tendency becomes stronger as the curvature decreases (Chang et al., 2007). On a curved path, the medial-lateral GRF and impulse were shown to be greater than on a straight path to change direction. In this study, medial-lateral GRF and impulse on the curved path were greater than on the straight path for both groups, and there were no significant differences between groups. The medial-lateral impulse (inside leg: 28.3 ± 8.9 Ns, outside leg: 23.8 ± 8.0 Ns) during running on a curved path in this study was lower than the data (inside leg: 39.9 ± 6.5 Ns, outside leg: 24.7 ± 5.8 Ns) in a previous study (Churchill et al., 2015b). On the other hand, the vertical impulse (inside leg: 147.3 ± 23.1 Ns, outside leg: 135.2 ± 31.8 Ns) in this study was greater than the data (inside leg: 81.3 ± 17.4 outside leg: 78.4 ± 18.0 Ns) in the aforementioned study (Churchill et al., 2015b). It is suspected that there was a difference in the vector of GRFs to perform curved path running between this and the previous studies.
Although the medial-lateral GRF and impulse showed an increase during curved path running in both groups, the posterior GRF and impulse decreased only in poor curve runners. Previous studies (Brughelli et al., 2011; Morin et

29
al., 2011, 2012) have indicated that the horizontal GRF and impulse mainly affect running speed. The results of this study suggested that running speed on a curved path was influenced only when the posterior GRF and impulse decreased. Furthermore, as shown in good curve runners, an increase in the medial-lateral GRF and impulse would not necessarily cause a decrease in the anterior-posterior GRF and impulse. In good curve runners, except for medial-lateral GRF and impulse, the analyzed variables showed no significant differences between straight and curved paths. However, in poor curve runners, some kinematic variables differed significantly between straight and curved paths. The decrease in the anterior-posterior GRF and impulse on a curved path as mentioned above could be caused by some of these differences in kinematic variables. Below, we discuss the kinematic variables that may induce the loss of running speed on a curved path.
In poor curve runners, the step length for the outside leg was significantly lower on the curved path than that on the straight path. However, there were no significant differences in the step length for the inside leg between paths. These results indicated that a decrease in step length for the outside leg caused the loss of running speed on the curved path in poor curve runners. Churchill et al. (2015a) also showed that step length on a curved path was lower than on a straight path only for the outside leg. Step length is determined by stance and flight distance (Hunter et al., 2004). Stance distance showed no significant differences between paths for both legs. Flight distance for the outside leg was significantly lower on the curved path than on the straight path. However, flight distance showed no significant differences between paths for the inside leg. Some previous studies (Brughelli et al., 2011; Hunter et al., 2004; Morin et al., 2012; Nummela et al., 2007; Weyand et al., 2000) indicated that step length and running speed were mainly determined by flight distance. The loss of running speed on curved paths in poor curve runners could be caused by the decrease in flight distance for the outside leg, which is the distance from foot release of the outside leg to foot touchdown of the inside leg. Since flight distance is decided by the impulse in stance phase, this decrease in flight distance could be

caused by the decrease in posterior GRF and impulse. Regarding kinematic variables for the outside leg, significant differences between paths only existed in the hip joint angle at foot takeoff in poor curve runners. Therefore, the decrease of anterior-posterior GRF and impulse could affect the decrease in the hip joint extension movement during the stance phase.
For the inside leg, step length and frequency showed no significant differences between paths for both legs in this study. The minimum value of knee and ankle joint angles for the inside leg on the curved path was significantly lower than on the straight path in this study. Ryan and Harrison (2003) examined the difference in knee joint movement between inside and outside legs during the stance phase on a curved path in a 200-m sprint. Similar to this study, they reported that the minimum knee joint angle of the inside leg was larger on curved path running. They also stated that the knee joint flexion movement caused an increase of stance time for the inside leg, which could lead to the decrease in step frequency and the loss of running speed on a curved path. However, in this study, although the knee joint flexion angle of the inside leg was larger on a curved path than on a straight path, the stance time and step frequency showed no significant differences between paths. The reason for this difference could be the increase in knee joint extension velocity during the stance phase. In this study, knee joint extension velocity of the inside leg on a curved path was significantly faster than on a straight path in poor curve runners.
Several studies (Alt et al., 2015; Churchill et al., 2015a, 2015b; Hamill et al., 1987; Stoner and Ben-Sira, 1979) have focused on differences in

kinematic and kinetic variables between straight and curved path running. However, the extent of the loss in maximum running speed on a curved path differs among runners, i.e., there are good and poor curve runners. In this study, we divided participants into good and poor curved path running groups and compared differences in kinematic and kinetic variables between straight and curved paths. In poor curve runners, the medial-lateral GRF and impulse on a curved path were greater than on a straight path to change direction, and the anterior-posterior GRF and impulse on a curved path were lower than on a straight path. In good curve runners, except for the medial-lateral GRF and impulse on a curved path, which were greater than on a straight path, all other analyzed variables showed no significant differences between straight and curved paths. The results of this study indicate that it is possible to run without decreasing the posterior GRF and impulse, even when the medial-lateral GRF and impulse become greater to change direction. Thus, the ideal technique for running on a curved path is to maintain the same kinematics and kinetics in the sagittal plane as on a straight path.
The number of participants in this study was limited (6 subjects in each group). Therefore, the division of participants into good and poor curve runners was clear. However, it is uncertain whether the division was appropriate. There has been no research on the relationship between running speed on the straight and curved paths. Future research with more sprinters included is required to quantify the percent difference in running speed on a curved path relative to a straight path, and evaluate the division into good and poor curve runners.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a major global public health pandemic. China was the first country to report the epidemic situation, which quickly identified the pathogen, and released the novel coronavirus gene sequence globally. Thus, China has played an essential role in the global fight against COVID-19. Since the outbreak of the epidemic, the Chinese government and citizens have pursued robust prevention and control measures, including wearing masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, etc. Large-scale nucleic acid testing has been fully implemented and has resulted in early detection, reporting, quarantine, and treatment. China's epidemic situation has been generally brought under control, and the fatality rate has been effectively controlled.[1-4] Recently there are sporadic cases of COVID-19 in China. Of the locally transmitted cases reported at January 20, 2021, 68 were reported in Heilongjiang, 33 in Jilin, 20 in Hebei, two each in Beijing and Shanxi, and one in Shandong, the National Health Commission reported.[5]
For further COVID-19 medical treatment, the National Health Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine have organized national experts of infection, respiratory and intensive medicine, pediatrics, and traditional Chinese medicine to revise the seventh edition of China's diagnosis and treatment plan. The appointed national experts have summarized prior clinical experience and referred to the diagnosis and treatment guidelines of WHO as well as other countries to produce the eighth edition of the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.[6] Currently, it has been updated, and the interpretation is as follows:
I. Epidemiological characteristics
Asymptomatic infected individuals or patients have been recognized as an important source of further infection. Current research has shown that the asymptomatic are similarly as

infectious as COVID-19 patients. Simultaneously, since asymptomatic infected individuals or patients do not take the initiative to seek medical treatment, their infectivity is more insidious. In this regard, large-scale active nucleic acid screening is an essential means to eliminate the potential transmission of the asymptomatic, and it is an effective measure in clinical practice. Moreover, following novel coronavirus infection, the infectivity during the incubation period is similar to that after the onset of illness, thus the statement that "infectivity occurs during the incubation period, but is highly infectious within five days after the onset of illness" was added. During the incubation period, transmission risk control is the key to quickly control the epidemic. Therefore, monitoring the mobility of the high-risk population and actively using nucleic acid detection are effective ways to eliminate the risk of latent infection.
Imported frozen food and outer packaging has tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, thus was added to the transmission route that included "contact with virus-contaminated items can also cause infection", which is a reminder that epidemiological information should be paid attention to in clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, regular nucleic acid screening for employees can detect infected persons early and help control transmission before spread.
II. Pathological characteristics
The new guidelines give an update on pathological characteristics of COVID-19. Anatomical features and microscopic findings of the main affected organs, such as the lungs, spleen, hilar lymph nodes, bone marrow, heart, blood vessels, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, brain tissue, esophagus, stomach, intestinal mucosa, and testes were described in detail, which provides a basis for understanding the clinical manifestations and therapeutic interventions of COVID-19. For example, the characteristics of extensive thrombosis provide a basis for clinical anticoagulation therapy, and the decrease of lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes is consistent with the appearance of peripheral blood, which provides a basis for clinical immunological intervention.
III. Clinical characteristics
1. Clinical manifestations
A new guideline adds that "in some patients, decrease or loss of smell and taste is the first symptom." Since decrease of smell and

17

Wang et al., Infectious Diseases & Immunity 2021;1(1)

www.idi-cma.org

taste is common in upper respiratory diseases, this chief complaint is often neglected if not carefully questioned. Simultaneously, "a small number of patients can also have central nervous system involvement and avascular necrosis of the extremities" and other manifestations, prompting clinicians to pay attention to the monitoring and intervention of consciousness change and coagulation mechanisms. A multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been reported by many countries worldwide, and the clinical manifestations of MIS-C were generalized in the new guideline. Thus, clinicians should be aware of this new addition.
2. Laboratory examination
The updated guidelines added that "SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies have a low positive rate within 1 week of onset". It was suggested that patients who are clinically suspected to have COVID-19 and those in convalescence with a negative nucleic acid result should be diagnosed by the antibody test to offset the false-negative nucleic acid result.
IV. Diagnostic criteria
Given the possibility of a false negative in nucleic acid detection and to further strengthen the screening of cases, which will effectively control the epidemic situation, "those who have no clear epidemiological history and meet any two clinical manifestations, and who are positive for novel coronavirus specific IgM antibody" should be added to "suspected cases". However, attention should be paid to the false-positive results of the IgM antibody test.
V. Clinical classification
The diagnostic criteria for severe cases in adults and children have been appropriately modified. For example, some ordinary patients may not experience fever or respiratory symptoms, but have the appearance of pneumonia in image.
VI. Criteria for high-risk of severe and critical cases
The people who have been identified as high-risk of severe and critical cases are as follows: (1) elderly people, age >65; (2) Patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (including hypertension), chronic lung diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, moderate to severe asthma), diabetes, chronic liver, kidney diseases, tumors, and other primary diseases; (3) Immunodeficiency (eg, AIDS patients, people treated by chronic use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs); (4) Obesity (BMI  30); (5) Women in the third trimester of pregnancy and perinatal period; and (6) Heavy smokers. Thus, identifying high-risk groups provides the basis for early clinical intervention. For the high-risk patients, more active disease observation and timely oxygen therapy are needed to reduce the risk of disease progression. It is crucial to discern the signs of severe or critical cases and transfer patients to the ICU in time to minimize the fatality rate.
VII. "Severe/critical early warning indicators" for adults and children
Through the analysis and summary of a large number of cases, studies have shown that many indicators can predict the

occurrence of severe/critical cases, such as lymphocyte count, inflammation indicators, etc. It is worth noting that those indicators differ among children and adults, which provides evidence for early clinical intervention. In addition, some indicators, such as lactate dehydrogenase level and troponin, can be used as warning indicators. In clinical practice, it is necessary to dynamically monitor the patient to discover changes in disease for timely intervention and quickly transfer patients into ICU for treatment.
VIII. Discovery and reporting of cases
In clinical practice, suspected cases are often negative for nucleic acid detection, but due to false-negative results of nucleic acid detection, SARS-CoV-2 infection cannot be ruled out for such patients. Therefore, patients may be excluded from a COVID-19 diagnosis when (i) the nucleic acid test results of suspected cases were negative for two consecutive novel coronavirus nucleic acid tests (the sampling time was at least 24 hours apart) and (ii) the specific IgM and IgG antibodies remain negative seven days after onset. This information provides criteria for exclusion of suspected cases, avoiding the problem of indefinite detention.
IX. Treatment
1. Antiviral therapy
Currently, there are no recognized specific antiviral drugs. Some antiviral drugs with safety data have been reserved for clinical trial use for the treatment of pneumonia in patients with COVID19. However, the necessity of further randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies has been emphasized. Lopinavir/ ritonavir and ribavirin alone, hydroxychloroquine, or azithromycin in combination are clearly not recommended.
2. Glucocorticoid therapy
A low dose of hormone and a short course of treatment have been recommended for patients with progressive deterioration of oxygenation index, rapid imaging progression, and excessive activation of inflammatory reaction.
3. Treatment of severe and critical patients
(1) The timely assessment of improvement in respiratory distress and/or hypoxemia should be performed. If no signs of improvement, additional respiratory support measures should be taken. The treatment using prone position ventilation has been emphasized for patients receiving oxygen therapy. If there are no complications, prone position ventilation (ie, awake in the prone position) should be simultaneously recommended. The treatment time while in the prone position should be more than 12 hours.
(2) The contents related to airway management were added and include the initiation timing, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) indications, ECMO mode selection, and recommended initial setting of ECMO.
(3) Indications for preventive "anticoagulant therapy" have been added, and in the event of a thromboembolic event, anticoagulant therapy should be administered using the appropriate guidelines.

18

www.idi-cma.org

(4) Principles of the treatment in MIS-C have been added, such as the usage of intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG), glucocorticoids, and aspirin.
4. Early rehabilitation
Because pulmonary fibrosis may occur in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia and patients generally have emotional states, such as anxiety and tension, it has been recommended to "pay attention to early rehabilitation intervention of patients, actively carry out rehabilitation training and intervention for respiratory function, physical function and psychological dysfunction of patients with pneumonia in COVID-19, and restore physical fitness, physique, immunity and mental health as much as possible".
5. Treatment by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
TCM plays an important role in the treatment of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. The eighth-edition guidelines have refined the TCM treatment principle based on syndrome differentiation and highlighted the "three drugs and three schemes" for clinical treatment.
X. "Nursing"
The nursing of critically-ill patients is a vital link to improve prognosis. Therefore, "nursing" has been added to the eighthedition of the guidelines, which has stressed the importance of "closely monitoring vital signs and state of consciousness, emphasizing oxygen saturation" in severe/critical patients with COVID-19. Nursing is necessary to prevent pressure injury in bedridden patients and strengthen the prevention and management of pressure injury in prone ventilation patients. Moreover, reducing nosocomial infection is the key to decreasing criticallyill patients' mortality rate due to prevention and control of hospital infection.

XI. "Prevention"
The eighth-edition of the guidelines has suggested to keep good personal and environmental hygiene, improve health literacy, keep adequate indoor ventilation, perform personal protection that has been scientifically proven, and visit the doctor when illness is suspected.

Abstract
Although conspicuous and well-studied, stag beetles have been slow to join the genomic era. In this study, mitochondrial genomes of two stag beetles, Sinodendron yunnanense and Prosopocoilus confucius, are sequenced for the first time. Both of their genomes consisted of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), 2 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and a control region. The mitogenome of S. yunnanense was 16,921 bp in length, and P. confucius was 16,951 bp. The location of the gene trnL(UUR), between the A þ T-rich and control region in S. yunnanense, is the first observed in Lucanidae. In P. confucius, an unexpected noncoding region of 580 bp was discovered. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference on the 13 mitochondrial PCGs were used to infer the phylogenetic relationships among 12 representative stag beetles and three scarab beetles. The topology of the two phylogenetic trees was almost identical: S. yunnanense was recovered as the most basal Lucanid, and the genus Prosopocoilus was polyphyletic due to P. gracilis being recovered sister to the genera Dorcus and Hemisodorcus. The phylogenetic results, genetic distances and mitogenomic characteristics call into question the cohesion of the genus Prosopocoilus. The genetic resources and findings herein attempts to redress understudied systematics and mitogenomics of the stag beetles.
Key words: mitogenomes, gene rearrangement, noncoding region, Chinese stag beetles, phylogenomics

Lucanidae (stag beetles) is a small family in Scarabaeoidea, containing about 1,800 described species and subspecies worldwide (Krajcik 2001, Bartolozzi and Sprecher-Uebersax 2006, Fujita 2010). Most studies support Lucanidae as a monophyletic group and an early diverging lineage in scarab beetles (Howden 1982, Scholtz et al. 1994, Ahrens et al. 2014) although a recent study has questioned Lucanid monophyly (Mckenna et al. 2015). There is a robust body of literature on taxonomy of this family (Arrow 1950, Didier and Se´guy 1953, Benesh 1960, Lawrence and Newton 1995, Krajcik 2001, Holloway 2007), with particular interest in sexual selection behavior and male polymorphism. As typical, molecular markers have more recently been used to enrich stag beetle systematics. Hosoya and Araya (2005) reconstructed the first molecular phylogeny of stag beetles (based on the molecular markers cox1 and rrnL) although using a small data set of only Japanese species. There has been particular attention to species delimitation and conservation of lucanids from Japan and Taiwan Island, partly because these beetles are popular as pets in these places (Huang and Lin 2010,

Kubota et al. 2011, Lin et al. 2011, Tsai et al. 2014, Tsai and Yeh 2016). Kim and Farrell (2015) performed the first comprehensive phylogenetic study, and revealed a Gondwanan origin of Darwin's stag beetle.
Undoubtedly these studies have shed light on the evolution of Lucanidae although using short gene fragments. Further, although widely used in phylogenetics, phylogeography and population genetics in insects (Timmermans et al. 2010, Cameron 2014a, Yuan et al. 2016), only three complete mitogenomes have been reported for lucanids; Lucanus mazuma (Sheffield et al. 2009), Prosopocoilus blanchardi (Kim et al. 2015), and Prosopocoilus gracilis (Wu et al. 2016, our recent work).
To address these insufficiencies, we herein report complete mitogenomes of two representatives from the Chinese fauna, Sinodendron yunnanense and Prosopocoilus confucius. In Sinodendron, four species are recognized worldwide; three are distributed in the Palearctic and Nearctic, whereas S. yunnanense is oriental, with a restricted habitat in Southwest China and quite

rare in the field. The species P. confucius is a large but otherwise typical member of the genus, also with limited distribution in South China. We aim to create a more robust understanding of the evolution of lucanid beetles by developing mitochondrial phylogenomics, with a particular focus on Prosopocoilus, including a comparison among P. confucius, P. blanchardi and P. gracilis.

Materials and Methods
Sample Collection and DNA Extraction The specimen of S. yunnanense was collected by Dr. Hong-liang Shi from Lanping, Yunnan, China, in July 2012, and the specimen of P. confucius was collected from Wuming, Guangxi, China, by YingHua Wu in July 2011. Total genomic DNA was extracted from the

muscle of a single S. yunnanense using the Qiagen DNAeasy Kit. For P. confucius, a small portion of the muscle from a specimen preserved in 100% ethanol was used for total DNA extraction with the Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The voucher specimens (S. yunnanense: MAHUSi012; P. confucius: MAHU00102) were deposited at the Museum of Anhui University, China, and the sequences were submitted to GenBank with the accession numbers KP735804 (S. yunnanense) and KP552119 (P. confucius).
Primer Design, Polymerase Chain Reaction Amplification, and Sequencing Complete mitogenomes were assembled from amplified fragments, with all primers used for amplification listed in Table 1. PCR amplification reactions were carried out in 25 ll volumes containing 10 lM of each primer (forward and reverse) 1 ll, 2 ll template DNA, 12.5 ll 2 Â EasyTaq SuperMix (þdye), and 8.5 ll sterile double-distilled water to make up a final volume of 25 ll. The polymerase chain reaction amplifications were performed under the following conditions: an initial denaturation at 94 C for 2 min, followed by 35-37 cycles of denaturation at 94 C for 40 seconds, annealing at 52-58 C for 50 seconds, and elongation at 70 C for 1 min, and then a final extension step at 72 C for 7 min. The temperature of annealing was

determined by the length of fragments. Sequencing was conducted with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Cluster strands created by bridge amplification were primed and all four fluorescently labeled, and 3-OH blocked nucleotides were added to the flow cell with DNA polymerase. The cluster strands were extended in single nucleotides. Following the incorporation step, the unused nucleotides and DNA polymerase molecules were washed away, a scan buffer added to the flow cell, then the optics system scanned each lane of the flow cell in imaging units (tiles). Once imaging was completed, chemicals that effect cleavage of the fluorescent labels and the 3-OH blocking groups were added to the flow cell, which prepares the cluster strands for another round of fluorescent nucleotide incorporation.
Mitogenome Assembly, Annotation, and Analysis The mitogenomes were assembled using SOAP denovo (BGI company, Shenzhen, China) and preliminary annotations made with the MITOS WebServer (http://mitos.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/index.py). tRNA genes and their secondary structures were inferred using tRNAscan-SE 1.21 (http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/). Those not identified by tRNAscanoSE, in addition to 16S ribosomal RNA (rrnL, lrRNA), and 12S ribosomal RNA (rrnS, srRNA), were determined according to sequence similarity with related species. The

protein-coding genes (PCGs) were determined by ORF Finder (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html) under the invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code. Nucleotide compositions, codon usage, and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values of PCGs were calculated with MEGA version 6.05 (Tamura et al. 2013). PCGs were translated with DNAMAN v7.0.2.176 (Lynnon Biosoft, Vaudreuil-Dorion, Canada). Mitogenomes were mapped with CGView (Grant and Stothard 2008, available at http://stothard. afns.ualberta.ca/cgviewserver/). Composition skew analysis was conducted according to formulas AT skew ¼ [A À T]/[A þ T] and GC skew ¼ [G À C]/[G þ C] (Perna and Kocher 1995).
Phylogenetic Analyses Phylogenetic analyses of stag beetles, including the newly sequenced S. yunnanense and P. confucius and 13 species retrieved from GenBank, were performed using a concatenated dataset of the 13 PCGs. Models of nucleotide substitution were selected according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) with jModelTest v2.1.4 (Posada 2008). Phylogenetic trees were generated from ML analysis using RAxML (Stamatakis 2014) and Bayesian inference (BI) with MrBayes v3.2.5 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist 2001), both under the

GTR þ I þ G model. Node support in the ML tree was estimated through bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replicates. The BI was conducted with two simultaneous Markov chain Monte Carlo runs of 2 million generations, sampled every 1,000 steps, with the first 25% discarded as burn-in. Phylogenetic trees were viewed and edited in Figtree v1.4.3 Rambaut 2016.
Results and Discussion
Genome Composition and Base Content The complete mitogenomes of S. yunnanense and P. confucius were 16,921 bp (Fig. 1), and 16,951 bp (Fig. 2), respectively. Details of the 13 PCGs, 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs, and control region are given in Tables 2 and 3. Their compositions were typical of the Coleoptera (Sheffield et al. 2009, Kim et al. 2015, Wu et al. 2016, Du et al. 2016, Yang et al. 2016). Of the 37 genes, 23 (9 PCGs and 14 tRNAs) genes were located on the J-strand, with the remaining 4 PCGs, 2 rRNAs, and 8 tRNAs on the N-strand. Typical of metazoan mitogenomes (Cameron 2014a), the single tRNA gene trnS (AGN) lacked the cloverleaf secondary structure, due to the structure of the dihydrouridine arm. The lengths of the tRNAs ranged from 61 to 71

nucleotides in both species. In both species lrRNA was located between trnL (CUN) and trnV, and was 1,278 bp in S. yunnanense, and 1,275 bp in P. confucius. srRNA was 767 bp in length and located upstream of the A þ T-rich region in S. yunnanense, whereas 747 bp and upstream of the control region in P. confucius.
The mitogenome nucleotide composition was A (38.8%), C (15.8%), T (36.2%), and G (9.1%) in S. yunnanense, and A (36.5%), C (21.9%), T (31.3%), and G (10.3%) in P. confucius, with an AT content of 75% and 67.8%, respectively. The higher AT content of S. yunnanense is relative to the A þ T-rich region. In five lucanid species, the heavy strand of the mitogenome has a positive AT-skew (0.035 to

0.107) and negative GC-skew (-0.362 to -0.271). In contrast, S. yunnanense rRNA genes have negative AT-skew and positive GC-skew. Interestingly, the AT-skew and GC-skew of PCGs were negative, and positive in the tRNA genes (Table 4). It has been proposed that nucleotide composition strand bias might be related to replication and transcription mechanisms (Hassanin et al. 2005, Song et al. 2016a).
PCGs and Codon Usage All PCGs of S. yunnanense and P. confucius had the conventional start codon for invertebrate mitochondrial PCGs (ATN) with the

exception of cox1 (AAT) as found previously (Sheffield et al. 2008). In S. yunnanense, 10 (eight in P. confucius) of the 13 PCGs shared the typical termination codons TAA and TAG, whereas in the remaining genes an incomplete stop codon T or TA was inferred. It is not uncommon in insects that incomplete codon structures signal a halt of protein translation (Wu et al. 2014, Li 2014, Cheng et al. 2016). The RSCU analysis indicated that codons including A or T at the third position were overrepresented in comparison to other synonymous codons (Fig. 3), which could reflect nucleotide bias.

Intergenic Spacers and Noncoding Region There was frequent occurrence of intergenic spacers in the two new mitogenomes, interspersed throughout the PCGs and RNA genes, and ranging from 1 to 580 bp in length (Tables 2 and 3). Among them, a 7-bp conserved motif (TACTAAA) upstream of nad1 was proposed as a binding site for the mitochondrial transcription termination factor, and noted in various beetles and other insects (Cameron and Whiting 2008, Sheffield et al. 2009, Cameron 2014b, Kim et al. 2015, Wu et al. 2016, Yang et al. 2016).

A notable result in P. confucius was a 580 bp noncoding region located between trnI and trnQ, with three structural sections: (C)14 in the initial third; (A)14 in the center, and a (C)9 in the latter third.

subunits; Kim et al. 2015). These features appear to reflect both congeneric and phylogenetic distances (Fig. 6). Moreover, this noncoding region did not occur in P. gracilis, despite being a longstanding member of Prosopocoilus. Indeed, the mitogenome of this species was structured more typical of insects. Absence of this noncoding region in P. gracilis and paraphyly of Prosopocoilus in relation to this species (Fig. 6) raises a question on its taxonomic status.
New Gene Rearrangement Gene arrangements of most insect mitogenomes are of the type exemplified by Drosophila yakuba, considered to be the ancestral state (Cameron 2014a). However, gene rearrangement events have been reported in many lineages (Timmermans and Vogler 2012, Song et al. 2016b), with a moderate frequency in Coleoptera (Wei and Chen 2011, Li et al. 2013). Although as the most diverse animal order (with >390,000 described species; Zhang 2013), there are merely $80 reported mitogenomes of Coleopterans, belonging to 32 families and representing all four suborders (as of February 2016). Gene rearrangement events have been reported in 10 of these, in the form of reversal or absence of tRNAs; in Anthicidae (1), Byrrhoidea (3), Chrysomelidae (3), Curculionidae (1), Lycidae (1), and Mordellidae (1) (Timmermans and Vogler 2012, Nie and Yang 2014).

In this study, we report a novel gene rearrangement of S. yunnanense, a first for Lucanidae. trnL (UUR), ancestrally located between cox1 and cox2, was translocated to a position between A þ T-rich region and control region (Fig. 4). Moreover, intergenic spacers were observed between trnL (UUR) and trnI, and cox1 and cox2, which is thought to be evidence of random gene losses (San et al. 2006). The TDRL model (tandem duplication followed by random loss; Moritz et al. 1987) was introduced to interpret the transposition of trnL (UUR) (Fig. 5). Additionally, recombination is another possible mechanism since illicit priming is unlikely due to the lack of a replication origin in this region (Wei et al. 2009). Data for more representatives are needed to determine the universality of the rearrangement in Lucanidae and to better understand the causal mechanisms.
Phylogenetic Analysis ML and BI phylogenies were reconstructed using a supermatrix of the 13 PCGs. The phylogeny showed that Lucanidae was a monophyletic group and S. yunnanense was sister to other Lucanidae (Fig. 6). Similarly, the genetic distance between this species and others was high (0.285-0.359) (Supp Table 1 [online only]). These results are consistent with previous studies based on morphological characters (Holloway 1960, 2007) and molecular data (Kim and Farrell 2015).
The species P. confucius and P. blanchardi were recovered as sister taxa (1.00 BPP, 83% MLB), and had low genetic distance (0.241; Supp Table 1 [online only]). This result is consistent with their traditional taxonomy. These two species have long been considered archetypal Prosopocoilus, sharing characters such as large, stout and shiny body, with straight and well developed mandibles in the males. However, the genus Prosopocoilus formed a polyphyly due to the distinctive positioning of P. gracilis (1.00 BPP, 100% MLB), sister to the pair Dorcus paralleipipedus and Hemisodorcus rubrofemoratus. The genetic distance among the three taxa of Prosopocoilus is 0.241, 0.287, and 0.296 (Supp Table 1 [online only]), whereas the value between P. gracilis and D. paralleipipedus is 0.267, and 0.260 with H. rubrofemoratus (Supp Table 1 [online only]). The status of P. gracilis has been revised often in morphological taxonomy. P. gracilis was first erected by Benesh (1950). Se´guy (1954) established the genus Epidorcus, including P. gracilis and a congener, despite a lack of convincing generic characters (see Zhong et al. 2014). Actually, its genital characters are quite distinct, and much more similar to those of species of Serrognathus (Wan 2007). Huang and Chen (2013) resurrected the genus Epidorcus for P. gracilis and its congeners after morphological analysis although they acknowledged characters shared by Epidorcus and Serrognathus species.
In our study, the phylogenomic analysis supported the morphological conclusion, i.e., P. gracilis should be removed from Prosopocoilus. Instead, P. gracilis probably belongs in Dorcus (s.l.). This is just one of many issues warranting more comprehensive work in Lucanidae phylogenetics, including higher-level classification, doubtful monophylies of some key genera, and species/subspecies boundaries and nomenclature, all of which would benefit from more comprehensive genetic data.

Intimate Partner Violence among Evermarried Women Treated for Depression at a Rural Health Center in Bengaluru Urban District
Savan Sara Mathew, Ramakrishna B. Goud, Johnson Pradeep1 Departments of Community Health and 1Psychiatry, St. John's Medical College, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India
Abstract
Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a risk factor for depression among women. Spousal alcoholism and marital quality are associated with both depression and spousal abuse Knowledge about the factors contributing to IPV in depression will enable us to have interventions to address IPV in tandem with treating depression. Objectives: (1) To estimate the prevalence of IPV in women treated for depression in a rural community healthcare facility in Bengaluru Urban District. (2) To assess the association between IPV and various other factors in women treated for depression in a rural community health care facility. Methodology: A crosssectional study was conducted among evermarried women above 18 years, registered under mental health program in the mental health clinic in Mugalur, Karnataka, and currently on treatment for depression. The women who consented were interviewed using structured questionnaires - WHOQOLBREF, standard of living index, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Index of Spouse Abuse, family interview for genetic studies for reported alcohol use, and marital quality scale. Results: The mean age of the study participants was 49.7 ± 13.2 years. The prevalence of physical IPV and nonphysical IPV was found to be 18% and 7%, respectively. Marital quality was significantly lower among women who experienced IPV. Women with husbands who ever used alcohol were found to have six times more risk of experiencing physical IPV, odd ratio 6.193 (1.595, 24.047). Conclusion: Health education, involvement of selfhelp groups, and awareness programs are required to alleviate IPV.
Keywords: Depression, domestic violence, intimate partner violence, spousal abuse, women

Introduction
The global prevalence of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) among all everpartnered women was 30.0% in 2013.[1] Various studies have shown that IPV is a risk factor for depression among women. Women who have experienced IPV in their lifetime have a higher prevalence of depression, suicidal thoughts, and attempts.[24] Physical or emotional abuse affects adversely on women's quality of life, and ultimately, the quality of life of the whole family.
Two important factors, among many others associated with depression, are spousal alcoholism and marital quality. Spousal alcoholism has been found to be an important factor contributing to spousal abuse.[5] It often decreases marital satisfaction and may result in an additional stress on the spouse.[6]
Very few studies have been done on women with depression regarding the prevalence of IPV. Although it has been

affirmed that spousal abuse is a risk factor for depression in the general population, it is important to know the magnitude in a particularly vulnerable group of women already having comorbidity such as depression.
Also, knowing about the factors contributing to IPV in depression will enable us to have interventions to address IPV in tandem with treating depression.
Objectives 1. To estimate the prevalence of IPV in women treated for
depression in a rural community healthcare facility in Bengaluru Urban District

2. To assess the association between IPV and various other factors in women treated for depression in a rural community healthcare facility.
Methodology
This crosssectional descriptive study was aimed to study IPV and the associated factors among the evermarried women aged 18 years or more treated for depression in a rural area. The study was carried out in Karnataka, a southern state in India where the population accounts for 5% of the total Indian population. More than half of the population (61.3%) reside in a rural area.[7]
The sample size was calculated based on the estimates of IPV prevalence in a rural panchayat in Trivandrum, Kerala, where the IPV was estimated to be 31.7% in ever-married depressed women (community based study-unpublished data).[8] Based on this estimate and considering a confidence level of 95% and relative precision of 20%, the sample size for this study was computed to be 92 evermarried women, this figure was rounded off to include 100 evermarried women.
After obtaining their informed consent, the women were interviewed at their homes. Data were collected through interviewing women using six structured questionnaires: 1. WHOQOLBREF for quality of life 2. Standard of living index for the standard of living and
socioeconomic classification 3. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale for screening and
grading of depression in the participants 4. Index of Spouse Abuse (ISA) for physical and nonphysical
IPV 5. Family interview for genetic studies for reported alcohol
use 6. Marital quality scale for marital quality and satisfaction.
A list of evermarried women, who were registered under the Rural Community Mental Health Program (Maanasi Project) and had visited the mental health clinic at least once in the past 1 year (prior to the commencement of the study) for treatment of depression, was prepared. The study participants were randomly selected from this list using currency method. If two or more ever married women were found in the same household, one subject was included by random allotment using the lottery method. Evermarried women are persons who have been married at least once in their life although their current marital status may not be "married" (women who are separated, widowed, or divorced).
Women who have been on treatment for depression under the rural communitybased mental health program based at institution's rural health training center and have come at least once to the clinic in the past 1 year were considered "women currently on treatment."
IPV was measured by a score above the cutoff score with ISA questionnaire which contained two subsets of questionnaires, namely ISAP for physical spousal abuse and ISANP for

nonphysical spousal abuse. A study done to find the reliability and validity showed that a cutoff score of 10 for ISAP and 25 for ISANP gives the maximum reliability.
The continuous variables were described in terms of mean with standard deviation and median with interquartile range, as appropriate. Categorical variables were described by proportions. To test the significance between two proportions, Chisquare test and independent sample ttest were used. Binary logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio of predictor variables and find adjusted associations.
Results
The study participants were evermarried women treated for depression (n = 100). The mean age of the study participants was 49.7 ± 13.2 years. Among the study participants, 75 (75%) of the women were currently married, the median age at marriage was 17 (15, 18) years. The mean age of the husbands was 53.4 ± 12.9 years. About onethird, 35% of the husbands had ever used alcohol, and among them, 74.3% had alcohol abuse and 37.1% were alcohol dependent [Table 1].
The prevalence of physical IPV in evermarried women treated for depression was found to be 18% and that of nonphysical abuse was 7%. Women belonging to higher socioeconomic status had a protective effect compared to women of middle and low socioeconomic class. There was no association between other sociodemographic factors of the women, such as age, education level or occupation of the women, and IPV in our study. In our study participants, physical and psychological domains of the quality of life were more affected than environmental and social relationship domains [Table 2].

Marital quality was significantly lower among women who experienced IPV compared to those who did not. Women with husbands who ever used alcohol were found to have six times more risk of experiencing physical IPV when compared to women whose husbands never used alcohol, odd ratio 6.193 (1.595, 24.047) [Table 3]. However, factors such as age, standard of living, and marital quality did not show any significant association.
Discussion
In our study, the prevalence of physical IPV in evermarried women treated for depression was found to be 18% and that of nonphysical abuse was 7%. This is slightly less, but comparable to the prevalence in Karnataka given in National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), where 20.4% of evermarried women experienced spousal abuse in the rural area.[9] According to a study conducted among educated women in a southern city of Karnataka, the prevalence of IPV was found to be 40.5%. This variation can be attributed to the difference in subject characteristics and the study tool used.[10] Physical IPV among married couples in a rural area of Thane, Maharashtra, was reported to be 35.9% and nonphysical violence was reported to be 31.7%.[11] The difference can be attributed to the fact that the age group of the two studies was different. The risk of IPV, both physical and nonphysical, was inversely associated with socioeconomic status. This is consistent with a study conducted by Koenig in Uttar Pradesh, where the risk of physical violence was significantly lower among households at higher socioeconomic levels.[12] Women's poor socioeconomic background had emerged as a strong predictor of domestic violence in India according to a study conducted by Kustov.[13]
In our study participants, the quality of life in all four domains was less in those who experienced IPV, although the result was not significant. The physical and psychological domains of the quality of life were more affected than environmental and social relationship domains. This may be due to coexisting depression and associated somatic symptoms.
Women whose husbands had ever used alcohol experienced were more at risk of IPV compared to women whose husbands did not use alcohol. In our study, women whose husbands ever used alcohol were at a greater risk of physical IPV (P = 0.0001) compared to women whose husbands never used alcohol. Our

study result is comparable to a study conducted by Begum et al. in the urban slums of Maharashtra, where women whose husband used alcohol were at a higher risk compared to women whose husbands did not use alcohol.[14] Our study found a significant association between marital quality and IPV, although IPV was more common in women with poor marital quality. This is similar to a study conducted in Nigeria, which showed that participants with low marital satisfaction experienced a higher level of domestic violence, while participants with high marital satisfaction experienced a lower level of domestic violence.[15] A hospitalbased study in Iran showed a negative correlation between marital satisfaction and domestic violence among pregnant women. That is, higher the marital satisfaction, lower the domestic violence among them.[16]
Conclusion
In this study, the prevalence of physical IPV (ISAP) in evermarried women treated for depression was found to be 18% and that of nonphysical IPV (ISANP) was 7%. In our study participants, physical and psychological domains of quality of life were more affected than environmental and social relationship domains. IPV was found to be associated with spousal alcohol abuse and poor marital quality.
Social desirability bias is one of the limitations of the study. Furthermore, the participants would be embarrassed to talk about a sensitive issue such as partner violence. Another limitation was that our study was cross sectional in nature; hence, the causal association of various factors could not be found. Education and counseling for the victims and their family members are needed as a shortterm measure. Longterm measures include health education, involvement of selfhelp groups, and more awareness programs regarding IPV.

Abstract
In neonates with more than one clinical abnormalities, we always look for a unifying diagnosis that explains the entire clinical presentation. In rare instances, two conditions can co-exist. Here, we report a neonate born out of consanguineous marriage presenting at 48 hours of life with microcephaly, encephalopathy, hypertonia. He had excessive weight loss, persistent hyperkalaemia, shock and elevated level of 17- hydroxyprogesterone. Steroids were started for adrenal insufficiency. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed T2 hyperintensity of cerebral white matter, hypomyelination and parenchymal volume loss causing microcephaly. Clinical exome sequencing (CES) revealed a pathogenic homozygous missense variation of CYP21A2 gene responsible for congenital adrenal hyperplasia and also the presence of a homozygous missense variant of unknown significance (VUS) of VARS gene implicated in neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, seizures, and cortical atrophy (NDMSCA). Baby was neurologically abnormal at discharge. In the setting of consanguinity, there is a possibility of two genetic conditions. Clinical exome sequencing test is useful in demystifying the diagnosis in complex clinical presentation.

Introduction
A single unifying diagnosis is always sought in neonates with multiple clinical phenotypes. However, in neonates born out of consanguineous marriage, occurrence of more than one condition in the same child and atypical phenotypes of genetic disorders are known (1). Such complex presentations make diagnosis and phenotypic classification

very difficult. Exome sequencing is preferred when the clinical presentation is atypical and in genetic or clinical heterogeneity (2). Here Here we report a neonate having heterogeneous presentation of hypertonia and hyperkalaemia, which could not be explained by any single condition and was solved by exome sequencing.
Case report
A term baby boy born at 39 weeks of gestation by vaginal delivery to a multiparous mother out of third degree consanguineous marriage and had normal transition at birth was presented. Elder sibling was 4 years old and developmentally normal for age. Our baby had a birth weight of 2.91 kg, length of 47.5 cm both falling between 10th -50th centile for age. Head circumference was 31 cm, which was below 3rd centile for age and hence suggestive of microcephaly. These findings had been overlooked and the baby was transferred to postnatal ward for routine care. There were no significant antenatal events and all the antenatal scans were normal. Baby was reported to be well until 48 hours of life and was transferred to the neonatal unit when noted with refusal to feed, irritability, jitteriness, exaggerated startle response and 7% weight loss. Microcephaly and exaggerated startle response were noted by the admitting team. Baby also had overriding sutures, sloping forehead, hypertelorism and low set ears on examination. In upper limbs, flexor tone was increased. In lower limbs, both flexor and adductor tone were increased as suggested by reduced popliteal, adductor Amiel-Tison angles and difficulty in changing diapers. Neck extensor hypertonia was evident due to the absence of head lag on pull to sit. The presence of dorsal incurvation more than ventral incurvation suggested truncal hypertonia. Deep

tendon reflexes including biceps, triceps, knee and ankle reflexes were brisk. Thus, the baby had both axial and appendicular hypertonia. There were no neurocutaneous markers. Abdominal examination did not reveal any organomegaly or palpable mass. Cardiovascular system and respiratory system were normal. Family history did not reveal similar complaints in any of the members. In addition, the baby also had reduced urine output with progressively rising creatinine and potassium since admission. Prerenal failure secondary to dehydration was considered in view of excessive weight loss. Ultrasound abdomen revealed structurally normal kidneys with normal doppler. However, incidental finding of bilateral enlarged adrenal glands with right adrenal gland having hyperechoic lesion and cystic spaces suggestive of haemorrhage was present. Differential diagnoses considered for the neurological abnormality were central nervous system malformations, inborn errors of metabolism, hyperekplexia and TORCH (Toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes, others) infection. Initial investigations for sepsis, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and metabolic screening which included ammonia levels, lactates and urine for ketones turned out to be negative. Electroencephalography was normal. Fundus examination was normal ruling out chorioretinits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed reduced cerebral parenchymal volume and diffuse hyperintensity involving cerebral white matter in T2 images (Fig. 2). Tandem mass spectrometry (TMS) revealed low carnitine, gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GCMS) of urine showed increased lactate and plasma amino acid profile showed elevated alanine. Mitochondriopathy was considered as a possibility in view of elevated lactate and alanine.

Urine output gradually improved but potassium continued to increase reaching a peak value of 8.8 mmol/l by day 10 of admission with a corresponding sodium of 122 mmol/litre. (Table 1 & Figure 1) Baby also had poor perfusion requiring a bolus of normal saline. Hyperkalaemia was treated conservatively with insulin dextrose infusion, potassium binding resin which led to resolution of tall T waves on electrocardiogram. 17 hydroxyprogesterone (17 OHP) sent as a part of newborn screening was reported on day 10 of life and was found to be elevated (115 ng/dl). Confirmatory serum 17 OHP was > 200 ng/dl and random cortisol of 5 µg/dl (low). Diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) was made based on the clinical and biochemical findings. Replacement doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were initiated. Hemodynamic stability was achieved and electrolytes got normalised. In view of heterogeneous presentation, a sample for clinical exome sequencing (CES) using Nextgen sequencing platform (Illumina platform; 6440 gene panel) was sent. Physiotherapy and early stimulation were initiated during the hospital stay. Parents requested for the discharge of the

baby due to logistic reasons by 17 days of life. At the time of discharge, baby was still behind birth weight at 2.7 kg, had a length of 48 cm and head circumference 31 cm. Steroids were continued after discharge. Exome sequencing revealed a pathogenic homozygous missense variation c1069 C>T (p.Arg357Trp) in exon 8 of CYP21A2 gene (mRNA accession number: ENST00000418967.2) responsible for congenital adrenal hyperplasia and also a homozygous missense variant of unknown significance (VUS) c.3212 T>A (p.Leu1071Gln) in exon 27 of VARS gene (mRNA accession number:ENST00000375663.3) which is implicated to cause microcephaly, seizures, cortical atrophy. The in silico predictions of the VARS gene variant was `probably damaging'by PolyPhen-2 (HumDiv) and `damaging' by SIFT, LRT and MutationTaster2. Parents were not willing for segregation analysis of the VARS gene. Parents were contacted at 2 months of age and they reported that the baby had failure to thrive, stiffness of limbs and seizures for which the baby was receiving anti-epileptics. He succumbed at 3 months of age.

Discussion
Persistent hypertonia from birth is indicative of an in-utero insult or developmental abnormality of the brain (3). Aicardi- Goutieres syndrome and in-utero infections can present with microcephaly and hypertonia. However, MRI did not show any calcification in our case. Schwartz Jampel syndrome, paramyotonia congenita, hereditary hypertonia / Isaac syndrome can present with hypertonia since birth. Likewise, Hyperekplexia can present with dystonia and exaggerated startle

response. However, clinical exome sequencing ruled out these syndromes. We could not explain both hypertonia and adrenal insufficiency (AI) by single etiology. Adrenal hemorrhage has a more common occurrence of 16-29 per 1000 live births as suggested by retrospective studies.(4) However, most newborns with adrenal hemorrhage do not require treatment, as even 10% functional cortisol-producing tissue is sufficient to prevent AI (5) and unilateral hemorrhage like in our case presenting as adrenal

insufficiency is unlikely.(6) Also, it cannot explain the raised 17 OHP levels in our baby. Coincidental adrenal hemorrhage causing AI in a neonate with congenital neurological abnormality was also considered. Frequency of autosomal recessive disorders is high in the regions with high rate of consanguinity and co-occurrence of 2 or more diseases in the same individual has also been rarely reported. Ali et al., (7) Stephen et al., (8) Fadda et al., (9) have previously reported complex phenotypes with occurrence of more than 1 disease in the same child similar to our case and all three were born out of either second or third degree consanguineous marriage. Mutation in CYP21A2 gene due to amino acid substitution of Tryptophan for Arginine at codon 357 is previously reported to cause 21 hydroxylase deficiency (10). A potentially novel missense mutation in the VARS gene, not previously known, was reported as VUS in our case. A total of 10 patients with VARS gene mutation have been reported till now (11,12). VARS gene encodes the only known valine cytoplasmic-localized aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase which is required for protein translation and gene deficiency is associated with neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, seizures, and cortical atrophy (NDMSCA). In the case series of 7 patients with biallelic missense mutation in the VARS gene (11), microcephaly at birth was present in one of them while the others developed microcephaly during infancy. Among them, one had global hypertonia similar to our child. Earliest age of onset of seizures was on day 2. Spectrum of MRI findings in VARS gene deficiency ranges from T2 hyperintensities, hypomyelination, cerebral volume loss to cortical

atrophy.(11) Our baby had a typical clinical phenotype associated with the gene deficiency in the form of microcephaly, global hypertonia since birth and reduced cerebral parenchymal volume, white matter hyperintensity in MRI. Further MRI at a later age might have revealed progressive cortical atrophy. VUS if associated with typical clinical phenotype and heterozygous mutation on segregation analysis of the parents can be reclassified as likely pathogenic. This can guide during the next pregnancy for antenatal diagnosis and management. Our neonate had typical phenotype but sangers sequencing could not be done in the parents. As two thirds of the population can potentially carry more than one gene variant, it is not surprising that our neonate had two genetic conditions, though as clinicians we search for unifying diagnosis. The possibility of having 2 genetic conditions should be considered more so in a consanguineous union. VARS gene mutation though very rare, should be considered in neonates with global hypertonia and microcephaly. Clinical exome sequencing is useful in demystifying the diagnosis in complex clinical presentation when other investigations are inconclusive.

This volume on intracerebral haemorrhage has 14 chapters, and is a part of the ongoing series, `Frontiers of Neurology and Neuroscience'.
The first chapter reports the epidemiology of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). ICH has an overall incidence of 24.6 per 100,000 person years and is associated with high fatality. The authors have searched Ovid MEDLINE for 24 years for systematic reviews and concluded that the incidence has not changed in the last 30 years. A regional variation with higher incidence in Asians with hypertension has also been reported. Overall emerging modifiable risk factors are alcohol consumption, body mass index, diabetes and diet.
In the second chapter on emergency imaging of ICH, the authors stress that imaging is important to rapidly diagnose the haematoma and the underlying complication and aetiology. An evidence based imaging framework is presented by the authors. Non-invasive angiography i.e., CT angiography is able to predict reliably the likelihood of haematoma progression, particularly the presence of small enhancing foci within the haematoma.
In the third chapter, `Evidence-Based Critical Care of Intracerebral Haemorrhage: An Overview', the authors opine that the outcome of the ICH is still poor, especially in the intensive care settings and efforts should be made to control systolic blood pressure to less than 140 mmHg and maintain ICP (intracranial pressure) at less than 20 mmHg. Haemostatic agents are not indicated in case of patients not receiving any anticoagulants.

In the fourth chapter, `New Insights into Blood Pressure Control for Intracerebral Haemorrhage', elevated blood pressure has been reported to be associated with poor outcome, although the exact pathophysiological mechanism is not known.
Chapter 5, `Emergency Reversal Strategies for Anticoagulation and Platelet Disorders' discusses the old established techniques and agents, as well as the new agents. Reference is also made to clinical situation where the anticoagulation has been put in place for a coronary stent. Furthermore, platelet concentrates and DDAVP have been shown to be both safe and effective for the rapid reversal of the antiplatelet drugs.
In the sixth chapter, `Reperfusion-Related Intracerebral Haemorrhage', the feared complication of intravenous thrombolysis has been discussed. Scoring systems for predicting ICH after intravenous thrombolysis are discussed at length. Management of the haematoma once it has occurred, is also discussed.
The next chapter on cerebral microbleeds, their detection, associations and clinical implications discusses the relevance of these microbleeds, associating them with cognitive decline. MRI findings in various sequences and their significance thereof are also discussed.
In the next chapter on new insights into nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and their reversal during ICH, the authors state that the reversal methods are not yet well established. General measures to prevent absorption of the drugs, administration of 4-factor prothrombin complex

concentrate (4F-PCC) and recombinant activated factor VII are reviewed.
Chapter 9 on ultra-early haemostasis for ICH not associated with any coagulopathy may include administration of tranexamic acid and recombinant factor VIIa and control of systolic blood pressure and ICP.
Extension of intracerebral haematoma into the ventricle independently contributes to morbidity and mortality, which is discussed in chapter 10. The 30 day mortality has been predicted using an IVH (intraventricular haemorrhage) scoring system. Among these ICH volume of >60 ml, severe hydrocephalus, GCS (Glasgow Coma Score) <8 and age above 70 yr are important variables, while EVD (external ventricular drain) may provide some useful decrease in ICP, endoscopic evacuation of haematoma from ventricle with or without thrombolytic therapy requires further evaluation.
In the chapter on surgical craniotomy for ICH, craniotomy and evacuation of clot is suggested surgery for GCS  13; meta-analysis ahead of completion of ongoing trials (CLEAR III, MISLIE III) may give more answers. The other methods of removing clot are by stereotactic and endoscopic aspiration.
The chapter on surgical strategies for acutely ruptured arteriovenous malformations (AVMS) is comprehensive, except related to small superficial AVMS. It is better to wait for four weeks after the rupture, for excising an AVMS.
In the final chapter on prognosis and outcome of ICH, the authors state that mortality at one month is 40 per cent. Data regarding long term outcome is however, scarce and not precise. Further studies are suggested for future research.
Overall this is a well written and edited book. It is informative and will be useful for medical postgraduates as well as clinicians and surgeons in the requisite field.

ISBN 978-981-4520-84-3
The author has proposed a paradigm shift in our understanding of genetics of healthy and diseased conditions including cancer in this book. He has tried to establish a holistic view of the genome as expressed in karyotype instead of reductionism of genes and epigenes. Morphology aberration has been proposed as the most important change that gives rise to many downstream genetic mutations and other changes. However, it is not clear how these can be precisely measured as SKY (Spectral Karyotyping) and interphase FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) have been mentioned for the present. It is also not clear what statistics will be used to calculate those aberrations. One would probably compare snapshots in discrete time instead of a time series estimation and will probably use linear rather than nonlinearity estimation. Though dynamics, chaos, part, system and fuzzy inheritance have been discussed, there is no mention of nonlinear complexity measures like Lyapunov and fractal dimension calculation. This work gives a fresh lease to the tiresome and less successful subject of oncogene albeit from a non-clinical standpoint.
After reading it for some time it becomes evident that there would hardly be any easier and lucid way to present such a different and difficult proposition. The author has tried to show cause behind cancer and futility of other theories mostly based on a reductionist's viewpoint, however, he starts off using the system approach in linear calculation using mathematical/numerical value of aberration. One might have to wait till it becomes useful clinically and probably diagnostically to begin with. A glimpse of the theory/hypothesis might be of interest to some who are in basic research in medicine.
This book has eight chapters. The first chapter introduces the subject "Why Debate Cancer, and Why Now". The second chapter discusses the gene mutation

Abstract
The superiorinferior ventricle is a rare anomaly with the unknown incidence owing to less number of reported cases. However, one of the studies has reported this incidence to be <0.1% of all congenital heart diseases. This has a characteristic imaging appearance with horizontal interventricular septum. Most of the previous reports of superiorinferior ventricles have been described on echo, catheter angiography and only a few with crosssectional imaging. We report two cases of superiorinferior ventricles associated with complex congenital cardiac defects on dualsource CT.
Key words: Congenital heart disease; horizontal interventricular septum; superoinferior ventricles

Introduction
The term superiorinferior ventricles (SIV) implies that the interventricular septum (IVS) is horizontal with the ventricles lying on above each other instead of side by side. It is also known as upstairsdownstairs ventricles and depending on the morphology, it can be either right ventricle (RV) on top or left ventricle (LV) on top. It is a rare anomaly and the exact incidence is unknown. However, TaksandeAM[1] has reported the incidence to be <0.1% of all congenital heart diseases [CHDs]. Most of the cases reported in the literature are of RV on top morphology and Porras et al.[2] has infact described the LV on top morphology for the first time in 2003. Since then there are quite a few cases of SIV which are reported in the literature with LV on top morphology. While most of the reported cases in the literature have projected SIV on echocardiography and catheter angiography,[15] we present two cases of complex

congenital heart diseases having associated SIV (RV on top morphology), deciphered on dualsource CT (DSCT).

Case History

Case 1 First patient was an 8yearold boy with cyanosis. CT scan showed situs solitus with levocardia. Both the ventricles were situated superoinferiorly with horizontal IVS [Figure 1]. The ventricle on top was of RV morphology with both great vessels arising from it (double outlet RV) [Figure 2]. There was a subaortic ventricular septal defect (VSD). Pulmonary stenosis with confluent pulmonary arteries was noted. There was malpositioned great arteries with aorta anteriorly and left of the main pulmonary artery [Figure 3]. Coronaries were normal.

Case 2 Second patient was a 15yearold male with cyanosis. CT scan showed situs solitus with levocardia. Both atria were connected to anteroinferiorly placed ventricle which was

of RV morphology. Morphological LV, which was placed posterosuperiorly [Figure 4] had no atrial connection. There was complete transposition of great vessels with aorta arising from morphological RV and pulmonary artery from morphological LV. Subaortic VSD was present [Figure 5]. Pulmonary stenosis with confluent pulmonary arteries was noted [Figure 6]. The associated rightsided aortic arch was also seen.

SIV is generally associated with other complex type of congenital heart diseases. However, Yang et al.[4] described cases with SIV being the only abnormality. Morphogenesis of this anomaly is a debatable topic with most of the recent literature suggestive of postseptational defect. Angelini et al.[3] suggested it to be a deformed mid-distal IVS and ventricles to a variable degree in addition to clockwise rotation of apical ventricular segments with normal atrioventricular valves and ventricular inlets, hence suggested the term "apical malrotation syndrome". Angelini et al.[3] also stated that crisscross heart and SIV are

Earlier generation CTs often produced images of suboptimal diagnostic quality. Newer generation CTs with improved temporal resolution produces excellent quality images so that all the associated defects can be depicted accurately. Better quality volume rendered CT images (VRT) can be produced, which depict this particular morphology accurately. In these cases, the images were acquired on DSCT (Siemens Somatom Force) with retrospective ECG gating and phasewise reconstruction. VRT images were generated with a bone subtraction algorithm. No premedication or sedation was required in these patients. These images accurately depict the complex anatomy as shown in the images and VRT images nicely show the SIV morphology.

SIV is a rare form of CHD, which is generally associated with another complex type of cardiac defect. With the latest development of CT scanners, accurate depiction of cardiac anomalies can be demonstrated and the latest reconstruction algorithms enable us to generate good quality VRT images as seen in our cases.

Aurora kinase A plays an essential role in mitosis including chromosome separation and cytokinesis. Aberrant expression and activity of Aurora kinase A is associated with numerous malignancies including colorectal cancer followed by poor prognosis. The aim of this study is to determine the inhibitory effects of LDD970, an indirubin derivative, on Aurora kinase A in HT29 colorectal cancer cells. In vitro kinase assay revealed that, LDD970 inhibited levels of activated Aurora kinase A (IC50=0.37 mM). The inhibitory effects of LDD970 on Aurora kinase A, autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser10), were confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Moreover, LDD970 inhibited migration of HT29 cells and upregulated apoptosis-related protein cleaved PARP. In cell viability assay, LDD970 was observed to suppress HT29 cell growth (GI50=4.22 mM). Although further studies are required, results of the present study suggest that LDD970 provide a valuable insight into small molecule indirubin derivative for therapeutic potential in human colorectal cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Aurora kinase A belongs to a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that are implicated in important processes during mitosis including centrosome and microtubule activities. Aurora A is involved in controlling several steps of mitosis such as centrosome maturation, bipolar spindle formation (1). Aurora A is phosphorylated on threonine 288 by binding to several protein partners such as targeting protein for Xklp2, p21-activated kinase 1, transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3,

and its activity appears to be a peak at G2 phase of the cell cycle (2,3). Overexpression and amplification of Aurora A has been reported to be detected in a number of solid tumors including colorectal tumors, and aberrant expression of Aurora A induces genomic instability by triggering mitotic checkpoints and apoptosis (4). Moreover, Aurora A overexpression leads to increased degradation of p53, resulting in oncogenic transformation of cells, and contributes to anti-cancer drugs resistance of cells (4,5). Furthermore, overexpression and amplification of Aurora A is correlated with poor prognosis in patients

with colorectal cancers (6). Thus, Aurora A is an attractive target for anticancer therapy due to its essential role in mitotic progression.
It is known that phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10 (Ser 10) is required for the proper execution of mitosis (7,8) and for the initiation of mammalian chromosome condensation (9). In addition, phosphorylation of histone H3 during the G2/M transition is tightly associated with the expression of Aurora A (10).
Several studies have reported that indirubin derivatives inhibit the proliferation of a variety of cells (11-13). In the present study, we describe an indirubin derivative LDD970, as a small molecule inhibitor, of Aurora kinase A activity in HT29 colorectal cancer cells.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture HT29 human colorectal cells were purchased from Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea) and were cultured in DMEM (Sigma Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/strep­ tomycin at 37oC in an incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2.
In vitro kinase assay Inhibitory activity of LDD970 against Aurora A kinases was measured by performing HTRF assays. The enzyme was mixed with serially diluted compounds and peptide substrates in a kinase reaction buffer (250 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
DTT, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% N1aN-3B). After

the addition of detection reagents, TR-FRET signal was measured using Victor multilabel reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). IC50 was calculated using nonlinear regression with Prism version 5.01 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA).
Cell viability assay Cell viability was measured by performing a tetrazoliumbased assay with EZ-Cytox Cell Viability Assay Kit (DaeilLab, Korea). Briefly, HT29 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1,000 cells/well and were incubated at 37oC for 24 h. The cells were treated with serially diluted LDD970 for 72 h. Next, 15 mL EZ-Cytox reagent was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37oC for 4 h. Absorbance was measured using Victor multi-label reader, and IC50 was calculated using nonlinear regression using Prism version 5.01.
Immunoblot analysis Expression levels and phosphorylation of Aurora A and histone H3 were evaluated by performing immunoblotting analysis as described previously (14). Antibodies against Aurora A (p-Aurora A) and PARP were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Antihistone H3 antibody and anti-phosphorylated histone H3 (anti-p-H3; Ser10) antibody were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA) and Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA), respectively. The monoclonal antibody against b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used for a loading control.
Wound healing assay HT29 cells were plated on 6-well plates and were cultured

until they reached 90% confluence. A 10 mL tip was used to create a 2 mm wound in the cell monolayer. Detached cells were removed by washing with DMEM. Cells in the plate were treated with LDD970 and were allowed to migrate for 24 and 48 h. Images of live cells were obtained using a phase-contrast microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany).

Results
Effect of LDD970 on Aurora A kinase activity LDD970 (Fig. 1A) was tested against Aurora A kinase activity using purified recombinant Aurora A protein. Aurora A inhibition was measured by performing the HTRF assay as described in Materials and Methods. LDD970 exhibited potent inhibitory activity with an IC50

of 0.37 mM. Inhibitory activities of LDD970 against other kinases are listed in Table I. LDD970 did not affected the in vitro kinase activities of c-Met, ALK, and JAK2 (IC50>10 mM). Moreover, LDD970 was likely to show selectivity toward Aurora A among all the kinases tested despite the use of small number of kinases.
Inhibition of Aurora A autophosphorylation by LDD970 in HT29 cells Upon activation, Aurora kinase A undergoes autophos­ phorylation at threonine 288 (3). Histone H3 is a substrate of Aurora A, and is phosphorylated by Aurora A at Ser10 (7). To determine the inhibitory effects of LDD970 on Aurora A in HT29 cells, we determined p-Aurora A and p-H3 (Ser10) levels in HT29 cells by performing im­ munoblotting analysis. Our results showed that LDD970 treatment decreased the levels of p-Aurora A and p-H3; however, no change was observed in the total expression level of histone H3 (Fig. 2A). Further, to confirm that LDD970 inhibited Aurora A kinase activity, we performed a time-course experiment to measure p-H3 levels in HT29 cells. Treatment of cells with LDD970 decreased p-H3 levels in a time-dependent manner. Even the inhibitory effect of LDD970 on histone H3 phos­phorylation was found to occur before 1 h after treatment of 1 mM and 10 mM of LDD970 (Fig. 2B).

Effects of LDD970 on HT29 cell growth and apoptosis Cytotoxicity of LDD970 was measured to evaluate HT29 colorectal cancer cells growth. Cells were treated with LDD970 for 72 h, and cell viability was measured. We found that LDD970 treatment suppressed the growth of HT29 cells with IC50 of 4.22 mM (Fig. 3A).
Inhibition of Aurora A activity induced mitotic spindle defect resulting in cell death through apoptosis (2). LDD970-mediated induction of apoptosis was confirmed by evaluating the levels of PARP cleavage. We observed a dose-dependent increase in PARP cleavage (Fig. 3B), indicating that LDD970 induced the apoptosis of HT29 cells.
Inhibition of HT29 cell migration by LDD970 Cell migration was assessed by performing the wound healing assay, followed by LDD970 treatment. After wound induction, cells were washed and were treated with the indicated concentrations of LDD970. LDD970 treatment suppressed the migration of HT29 cells in a concentration-dependent manner as compared to untreated cells (Fig. 4).
Discussion
The microtubules play an important role during mitosis (15), providing an ideal drug target for cancer therapy. It has been demonstrated that antimitotic drugs such as

taxanes and vinca alkaloids have specific interaction with microtubules. They inhibit the microtubule dynamics by disturbing the spindle assembly checkpoint (16). Although these drugs are currently the best approach for treatment of variety of tumors, there are still issues on severe side effects. Moreover, Antimitotic agents exert cytotoxic effects on non-tumorigenic cells and induce drug resistance (16). Development of anti-cancer agents that disrupt mitosis and enhance therapeutic potency with fewer side effects is the main focus of new Antimitotic drug research. Aurora A is a mitotic specific kinase that has been identified as a promising target for anti-cancer therapy.
In this study, we reported that LDD970, an indirubin derivative, possessed inhibitory activity against Aurora kinase A, resulting in decreased proliferative capacity and viability, and inhibition of migration as well as in­ duction of apoptosis in HT29 human colorectal cancer cells. This result clearly showed that LDD970 displayed a potent inhibitory activity against Aurora kinase A. Inhibition of Aurora kinase A activity using Aurora A recombinant enzyme was attested by the evaluation of autophosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10. The phosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser10) plays an important role in chromosome condensation and is controlled by Aurora kinase A during G2/M transition (10). Following inhibition of histone H3 phosphorylation, chromosome condensation is prevented and entry to mitosis is knocked down. The levels of histone H3 phosphorylation were measured to determine whether LDD970 had the effect on the cells. Our data revealed that the levels of phos­ phorylated histone H3 were inhibited with LDD970 treatment in HT29 cells. Moreover, exposure to LDD970 was found to inhibit phosphorylation of histone H3 in both short-term and long-term treated periods. These results were consistent with previous reports that treatment of Aurora A inhibitors in human cancer cells overexpressing Aurora A resulted in loss of phosphorylated histone H3 (17). This indicates that LDD970 is an Aurora A kinase inhibitor since phosphorylation of histone H3 is a direct downstream target of Aurora kinase A. Further, using the wound healing assay, we demonstrated that cells treated with LDD970 for 24 h and 48 h showed a reduced capacity to undergo migration. In addition, when LDD970 was applied to HT29 cells, PARP cleavage was increased (18), suggesting that LDD970 induced apoptosis. These results are in agreement with previous findings that treatment with Aurora kinase A inhibitors not only block cell proliferation and migration, but also induce apoptotic cell death (17,19).

Aurora A has received much attention because of its important role during mitosis and association with cancer progression. Drugs that inhibit Aurora kinase A have been discovered and currently pursued in stages of preclinical and clinical development (20). However, further in-depth studies require increasing the efficacy and reducing side effects. This LDD970 study provides useful pharmacological information in the field of Aurora A research.

V PRECIS OF OPERATIONS PERFORMED IN
THE WARDS OF THE FIRST SURGEON, MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL, DURING
THE YEAR 1886.
By Surgeon-Major K. McLEOD, A.M., M.D., F.R.C.S.E., Professor of Surgery, Calcutta Medical College.
(Continued from page 138.)

VI. Removal of Tumours {by Excision).
A.?Malignant Tumours.

VI. i. Scirrhus of mamma and axillary glands.?i. European, cel. 45. Tumour of left
breast of three mouths' duration. Skiu not in-

volved. Nipple not retracted. General health fair. Gland removed by elliptical incisions. Two cancerous glands removed from the axilla. Edges of incision brought together by metal-
lic and horse-hair stitches, and an incision

made for drainage in the lower flap. Dressed antiseptically. Wound remained aseptic, and healed by first intention, except about two inches of its centre which was closed by granu-
lation. No constitutional disturbance of conse-

quence. Discharged 21 days after the operation. Returned in a few days complaining of palpitation which was found to be functional, and

subsided under treatment.
ii. Hindu, out. 42. Tumour of left breast of
two years' duration. Skin involved and nipple retracted. Axillary glands enlarged and in-
durated. General health fair. Gland extir-

pated by two elliptical incisions. Axillary

glands removed. Wound closed by metallic and

horse-hair sutures. Dressed antiseptically, and

remained aseptic. Left hospital with a sound

cicatrix fifteen days after the operation.

iii. Hindu, cat. 56. Scirrhus of right breast

of five months' duration. Skiu implicated.

Nipple retracted. Axillary glands diseased.

A few enlarged and indurated glands also

above clavicle. An iucision about two inches

long was, in the first instance, made above the clavicle parallel to the sterno-mastoid for the purpose of, if possible, removing the diseased supra-clavicular glands. These glauds were taken away bv means of the finger, and no more were felt. The breast was then removed including the skin covering it. The axilla was thoroughly emptied of glands. Several small hard glauds were found beneath the clavicle and be-
tween the pectoral muscles. A curved incision
was made below the axilla to permit of the transplantation of skin upwards aud forwards to fill the large gap caused by the free removal of skiu. A drainage tube was carried under the clavicle from the ueck wound to the lower angle of the axillary wound, and the whole dressed antiseptically with great care. The wound remained sweet for three days, then putrefied. Suppuration took place, and high fever aud diarrhoea ensued. Pronouuced symptoms of septi-

csemia of a severe type Bet in on the twelfth day, and patient was removed in a moribund state fourteen days after the operation.
%* This was a very severe operation ; but
there is every reason to think that the case would
have done well had the wound remained aseptic. The wound probably became septic in conse-
quence of the movements of the head disturbing the upper portion of the dressing. Efforts
were made by means of injections to extirpate putrefaction, but without avail.
iv. Eurasian, cat. 40. Tumour of left breast noticed two months ago. Skin not adherent; axillary glands enlarged and indurated; general health delicate. Mamma removed by elliptical incisions including nipple. Several diseased glands removed from axilla. Edges of wound brought into accurate contact, and a hole made in the lower flap for drainage. A small portiou of the lower flap sloughed at the centre of the wound and some suppuration took place around it. The rest of the wound healed by first intention. The drainage tubes were gradually shortened. Left hospital 31 days after operation with the wound nearly healed.
v. Hindu, cet. 30. Cancer of the right breast of 11 months' duration; skin involved; axillary glands enlarged and indurated. Breast extirpated together with the skin covering it. Axilla thorough cleared. A large flap was taken from the side of the chest aud moved upwards and
inwards to fill up the wound. It was stitched
with catgut, and two triangular gaps left ou each side to heal by granulation. Wound remained aseptic. Flaps contracted adhesions and the intervals between them healed by granulation. Patient remained in hospital 80 days.
2. Removal of recurrent cancerous glands.? i. European male, cat. 55. Had been operated on for epithelioma of tongue (see e, i, below). A gland situated beneath the left sterno-mastoid became enlarged and was enucleated on the 11 tli of February. The wound
healed within a week.
ii. Same case. Another gland beneath the same muscle, lower down, underwent enlargement and was extirpated ou the 20th of March; the wound healed rapidly, but the disease recurred at the root of the neck beyond reach of operation. He left the hospital on the 23rd of April.
3. a. Epithelioma of the Scalp.? Hindu female, cet. 45. Had a tumour of the occiput from childhood, which attained the size ot a foetal head aud was removed eight months ago. It has recurred and presents the appearance of a large cauliflower excrescence. It^ was removed together with a liberal margin of sound scalp. The tumour was adherent to the occipital protuberance which was chipped off with a chisel. The wound remained aseptic and healed by granulation. She remained iu hospital 70 days, and

on her discharge no sign of recurrence was
observed. She has not been heard of since she

left hospital. b. Epithelioma of the nose and face.?Hindu
male, cet. 45. A small nodule appeared at the tip of his nose four months ago, which rapidly increased and spread until the disease involved the whole of the upper lip, whole of the nose as far as the bridge, and the adjacent cheek to some extent. The tumour presented the characteristic signs of epithelioma. It was isolated by two incisions starting from the angles of the mouth and meeting over the nasal bones. The growth was undermined and removed, leaving the patient without an upper lip and nose. Symmetrical flaps were cut from the cheek to supply their place and stitched together iu the middle line. Some diseased glands were also removed from below the jaw. Patient got high reactive fever. Diarrhoea set on on the third

day, and lie died of exhaustion 60 hours after the operation.
c. Epithelioma of the cheek.?Hindu female, cet. 50. Was in the habit of chewing lime and tobacco leaves since the age of nine; noticed a

growth on the inside of the right cheek 1A-

been extending ever since. He suffered from syphilis in youth, and under the impression that the growth was syphilitic, he was treated with large doses of iodide of potassium without avail. The left side of the tongue is occupied by au indurated sloughy ulcer which extends from the tip to the anterior pillar of the fauces, which is implicated. The left sublingual gland is enlarged and indurated. Total extirpation of the tongue was performed on the 8th of January. The floor of the mouth was divided externally in the middle line by an incision extending from the symphysis to the hyoid bone. Two needles were passed from this wound beneath the lingual artery and brought out below the angle of the lower jaw ; the tissues between the surface and the needles being compressed by an elastic cord passed round the projecting ends. The deep attachments of the tongue were then separated by the finger and divided with scissors. The left sublingual gland was removed, and the operation completed by the ecraseur. A drainage tube was placed in the submental wound, and the parts freely sprinkled with iodoform. The wound healed slowly by granulation, and was soundly cicatrized. Patient was able to talk

years ago. It now extends from the angle of the mouth to the level of the last molar, and
from about an inch below the upper alveolus to the lower, which is to some extent implicated. Tongue and floor of mouth healthy. Cheek divided by an incision curving from angle of mouth outwards and downwards. Growth isolated aud removed by division of buccal mucous membrane. One tooth extracted and gum of lower jaw removed together with subjacent alveolar process; a diseased gland removed from below angle of lower jaw. Wound carefully stitched.
It healed by first intentiou in 14 days. Patient j left hospital 27 days after operation. No sigu
of recurrence.
d. Epithelioma of lower lip.?Eurasian male, cet. 37. Observed a growth of the right side of the lower lip three years ago. During the last month the right submaxillary gland has been undergoing enlargement. The growth now occupies the right half of the lower lip, and the right submaxillary gland is large aud indurated. The right half of the lip was removed by a V shaped incision, aud the submaxillary gland enucleated through a straight incision. Both wounds were carefully stitched and healed by first intention. He left hospital 22 days after the operation. Some induration remained in the
submaxillary region. He was subsequently
readmitted with a recurrence of the disease
(See f, i below). e.?rEpithelioma of the tongue.? i. European male, at. 55. About 10 years
:igo noticed a small growth on the tongue which is said to have been cured by a Persian physician. Two years ago this growth re-appeared, and has

very distinctly and retained some sense of taste, being able to distinguish salt from sugar.
The disease subsequently recurred in the glands of the neck, and two operations were performed for their extirpation on the 11th of February and 20th March (see 2 i, ii, above). Recurrence again took place beyond reach of operation, and he finally left hospital on the 23rd of April.
ii. East Indian female, est.. 72, admitted with a warty growth on the right side of the tongue
about the size of a hazel nut of five months' dura-
tion. The growth was removed by curved scissors and the edges of the wound stitched with catgut. It healed in 7 days, and patient left hospital 13 days after the operation.
Recurrence subsequently took place in the cervical glands situated beneath the right sternomastoid. (See g, below).
f.?Epithelioma of the lower jaw.? i. Eurasian male, at. 37, had undergone operation for cancer of the lower lip and submaxillary gland. (See d, above.) Readmitted* one month after the operation with a hard rapidly growing lump in the right submaxillary region; skin infiltrated. A triangular piece of skin was removed with all the morbid material
underlying it, including the lower border of the
lower jaw to which it adhered. The dissection was deep and difficult. The wound was closed by flaps taken from the neighbourhood. It did well, but recurrence again took place in the neck and cheek, and patient declining further operation, which indeed was not pressed, left the hospital 55 days after the last operation, and was subsequently reported to have died.

ii. J. C., aged 30, an Englishman, and enginedriver by occupation, was admitted on the 11th of November 1886. In the preceding January he had had an operation performed for cancer of the lower lip. He remained well till August when a swelling formed beneath the chin which gradually increased, and finally burst, leaving an open sloughy sore with an extensive and deep indurated base.
On admission, the disease was found to involve the lower lip, chin and lower jaw, and
extend down the front of the neck as far as the
episternal notch. The man was fairly nourished, but suffered from bronchitis. The larynx was found to move up and down during deglutition, and no enlarged gland could be detected. At the patient's urgent entreaty an operation was performed. The central half of the lower lip was isolated by vertical incisions which were carried to the angles of the lower jaw, and along the anterior borders of the steruo-mastoids as far as the episternal notch where they met. The lower jaw was divided at the angles, and
the whole of the tissues included in the inci-
sion removed down to the surface of the larynx. Both submaxillary and sublingual glands were taken away, and the body of the hyoid bone, which was eroded, removed. The operation was of a very formidable character, and some 60 vessels had to be ligatured. The edges of what remained of the lower lip were brought together. Laryngotomy was found to be necessary owing to the falling back of the tongue and epiglottis. The wound was sprinkled with iodoform, and dressed with boracic gauze. Patient was fed at first per rectum, and then by a funnel and tube passed into the oesophagus. The parts gradually healed. The lower lip adhered, and the wound on the front of the neck underwent granulation, cicatrization and contraction. Patient was taught to feed himself, and improved greatly in general health. He continued to wear the tracheal tube; but ^vas able to walk about the hospital grounds. About two months after the operation, infiltra-
tion of the skin was observed at a little distance from the wound on either side.
These lumps have extended and ulcerated* and are now rugged sloughy open sores set on a deep, hard, extensive base exactly resembling
that^ which existed on his chin when he was admitted. He is emaciating, and the end is not far off. (Died 31st Mav).
9-Ejnthelio ma of the neck (recitrrent). ?? Patient had undergone an operation for cancer of the tongue (e ii) on the 28th of April. In
the middle^ of August she noticed a swelling
below the right ear which has been gradually increasing. It is about the size of an orange, hot red and tender, and movable. On the 23rd
of October an attempt was made to remove the tumour; but it was fouud to embrace the

carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and the operation was not completed. As much of the cancerous material as had broken down was scraped away, and the wound left open and dressed antiseptically. Patient lived for 52 days ; the tumour increased and fuugated, and death was due to exhaustion.
h.?Epithelioma of the penis and inguinal glands.?Hindu male, est. 32. The disease appeared eight months ago. The glans and prepuce are involved and the inguinal glands on both sides. The penis was removed by Hilton's method, the corpus spongiosum being cut half an inch longer than the corpora cavernosa,
slit on the ventral aspect and attached to the lower angle of the wound by a few horse-hair
sutures. The inguinal glands were extirpated by incision parallel to Poupart's ligament; they were beginning to break down. The penis healed well, but recurrence took place in the groins. Patient lived for 38 days, and died of
exhaustiou due to fever and diarrhoea. The
fever existed prior to the operation and persisted to the end. The diarrhoea set in 20 days before death and proved uncontrollable.
%* The foregoing record of 17 operations for cancel', concerns 13 cases; two patients having undergone a second operation and one patient two secondary operations for recurrence. Two of the patients had moreover been subjected to a primary operation before admission. Of the 13 persons, 4 died in hospital, 2 left hospital in a hopeless state, I is still in hospital in a dying state, and 6 recovered and left hospital without any sign of re-
currence. Four of these were cases of scirr-
hus of the breast, in which a thorough removal of axillary glands was resorted to in addition to extirpation of the mamma and free removal,
of the affected skin. The record is a melan-
choly and disheartening one. In the cases in which recurrence occurred, this took place in all but one iustance in the nearest lymphatic gland. The experience of the year reiterates the old lesson, that the only hope of success in operations on cancer consists in very liberal ablation of tissues in the vicinity of the disease, and the careful removal of suspicious glands in the neighbourhood. Even when these measures have been adopted with an unsparing hand, the result is too often disappointing and dis-
astrous.
4. a.?Excision of Sarcoma of the left Upper Jaw.?-Hindu male, at. 19. Five months ago a swelling of the left upper jaw was noticed, which has rapidly increased in size. It involves the whole of the left superior maxilla
and part of the malar bone. The eye is not
displaced, but there is a large bulging of the
alveolar and palate processes into the mouth. The whole of the left upper jaw bone and malar were removed iu the usual manner. Fergus-

son's method of dividing the skin was followed. The wound was accurately closed by horse-hair stitches, and the cavity stuffed with boracic lint sprinkled with iodoform. The skin wound healed by first intention, and patient left hospital 24 days after the operation with a sunken cheek and a hole about \ an inch in diameter in
the roof of the mouth. He returned a few months afterwards with a recurrence of the
tumour in the angular process of the frontal bone and roof of the orbit. A second operation was not considered feasible.
b.? Sarcoma of the hard Palate.?Hindu male, cet. 35. Soft tumour of hard palate involving also the alveolar processes of both superior maxilla} as far as the bicuspid teeth ; of five months' duration ; very vascular and ul-
cerated on the surface, bleeding profusely. The upper lip was divided in the middle line aud
the incision carried into the nostrils. The soft
parts were raised off the surface of the tumour, and the soft palate divided horizontally. The cartilaginous septum of the nose was divided, and central portions of the upper jaw together
with the tumour removed by means of a bone forceps. A good deal of blood was lost. Patient
died of shock in six hours. The tumour was
found to be a small round-celled sarcoma.
c.?Sarcoma of the shoulder.?Mahomedan male, at. 50. Had a tumour removed from the top of the right shoulder seven years ago. It reappeared six months ago, and has attained the size of a hen's egg. It is freely movable, is soft and fluctuating and has been bleeding for the last few days. It was removed with a liberal margin of adjacent skin, and a flap was taken from the shoulder to cover the wound. Repair was satisfactory, and patient left hospital with a sound cicatrix in 33 days. The tumour was found to be a spindle-celled sarcoma.
d.?Sarcoma of the Arm.?Hindu male, cet. 27. Tumour of middle head of left triceps of three years' duration, skin not implicated. It was exposed by a longitudinal incision and thoroughly removed together with the long head of the triceps. The wound healed by first intention, and patient left hospital i9 days after the oper-
ation. He has not been heard of since.
e%?Sarcoma of Bach.?Hindu male, cet. 30. Had been operated on two years ago for a tumour of the back of about six years'duration. The growth soon recurred and it is now 4 inches long by 2 inches broad, soft tungating but movable; situated between the spine and right scapula. It was removed together with a free margin of adjacent skin and liberal amount of subjacent tissue. The wound healed by granulation in 63 days.
f.? Sarcoma of the Buttock.?Eurasian female, cet. 52. Noticed a tumour on the right gluteal region 9 mouths ago, which was removed five months ago. Another tumour had grown

on the soar. It is about the size of a pigeon's egg, and involves the skin and subjacent fascia. It was removed together with a liberal margin of surrounding tissue. The wound healed by granulation in 40 days.

B.?Non-Malignant Tumours.

i. Elephantiasis of the Scrotum.?i. Hindu, est. 21. Had a suppurated hydrocele twelve years ago. Scrotum began to enlarge four years ago.

xiii. Mahomedan, at. 25. Scrotal tumour of
four years' duration with right inguinal reducible hernia. Health good. The tumour, which
weighed 13 oz., was removed in the usual way,
aud?the sac of the hernia was then isolated, tied at the neck, aud removed. The pillars were brought together by catgut. Suppuration took
place iu the hernial wound, and a small abscess also formed iu the perinajum. With these exceptions, repair proceeded in a favourable manner, and patient left hospital quite cured of both tumour and hernia in 65 days.
xiv. Mahomedan, cet. 40. Tumour of two years' duration. A few lymphatic vesicles on the surface; double hydrocele. Health good. Operation as usual. Weighed 1 fb 7 oz. Wound remained aseptic aud healed iu 70 days.
xv. Eurasian, at. 35. Had a small scrotal
tumour removed iu 1880. Underwent an oper-
ation shortly afterwards for adhesion of the under surface of the penis to the cicatrix. Had a small lymph-scrotum removed iu 1885. This healed soundly, but the skin on each side of the scar has again become spongy and hypertrophied. This skiu was thoroughly removed by au elliptical incision, and the edges stitched.
The wound remained aseptic aud "healed iu 38
days. xvi. Hindu, at. 35. Tumour of eight months'
duration. Development accompanied with periodical fever. Health good. Usual operation
performed. Large hydrocele on right and small on left side; tumour weighed 1 ft fo oz. Wound
remaiued aseptic and healed in 72 days. xvii. Hindu, at. 45. History of two at-
tacks of gonorrhoea, the last four mouths ago,

Wound got foetid on the sixth day, aud some sloughs formed ou the surface. There was slight fever at this period. About 35 days after the operation patient got an attack of acute eczema all over his body which was thought to be due to the bichloride of mercury. Iodide of potassium was administered internally, and boracic dressings substituted for the bichloride. The eczema disappeared and patient left hospital quite well 64 days after the operation.

a year afterwards. Since then the scrotum has
undergone enlargement with periodical fever. Spleen enlarged ; has fistula in auo. Consumes five grains of opium daily. Tumour removed in the usual way ; weighed 12 fbs. 2 oz. Wound remained aseptic, aud recovery took place in 63 days.

forin and was let t in situ tor from 10 to 14
days. TV heu removed, the wound was found in full process of aseptic granulation. These measures kept the wound aseptic and free of suppuration in all but a few cases, and in these the putrefaction and suppuration were partial.
The tumours were mostly small and the, subjects healthy. The mortality (5 per cent.) was very favourable. The single fatal case was that of an elderly man whose health had been shattered by debauchery, and who succumbed from the shock of the operation and the subsequent reaction, causing prostration and exhaustion.
b. Elephantiasis of the labia. Hindu, <2f. 25. Suffered from double bubo a year ago and both labia began to swell about a month ago. The labia were removed by elliptical incisions, the edijes of which were brought together by catgut and healed in 25 days.
2. i. Lipoma of the thigh.?Hindu male, cet. 18. The tumour of 12 years' growth occupies Scarpa's triangle (right side), displacing
the femoral artery outwards. It is about the
size of an apple, and freely movable. A straight incision exposed it, and it was easily shelled out. The wound remaiued aseptic and healed in 31 days.
ii. Lipoma of the groin.?Hindu male, at. 24. Large tumour of seven years' duration extending from Poupart's ligament to about 2 inches below the umbilicus on the right side, lobulated and freely movable. It was exposed by a straight incision, and shelled out without difficulty. Wound remaiued aseptic and healed by first intention. Patient left hospital in 34 days.
3. Simple Epulis of lower jaw.?Hindu male, at. 16. The tumour began to grow six months ago and occupies the left alveolus, corresponding to the incisor and canine teeth. History of fall three years ago. Five teeth were extracted and the growth together with the subjacent (jum and bone removed. Bleeding
"11
stopped by cautery. The wound healed kindly and patient left hospital in 11 days.
4. Naso-pharyngeal polypus.?Mahomedan male, cet. 21. Noticed a growth in left nostril
two years ago. It now protrudes from the nostril which is much expanded and displaces the soft palate forwards. It is very hard, and there is a
muco-purulent discharge from the nostril. The nose was slit open, exposing the chamber of
the left nasal fossa. The chain ecraseur was
passed round the growth and part of it removed. The remainder was avulsed Avith a pair of necrosis forceps. The fossa was stuffed with boracic lint and the nose carefully stitched. A good deal of blood was lost. The nose healed by first intention and the cavity by granulation. It was regularly washed out with Condy's
fluid. A few magOgCots came out of it for a
few days, but they disappeared under the use

of iodoform. Lett hospital perfectly well 37 days after the operation.
5. Cystic tumour of the loioer jaw. ? i. Hindu male, cet. 26. Tumour commenced seven

years ago. Implicates the whole ot the right half aud the body of the left half of the jaw.. Tongue secured by a cord. Lower lip divided
in the middle line and the incision carried

downwards and to the right over the most prominent part of the mass where the integument was much stretched and thinned. Flaps reflected from outer surface of tumour; jaw divided at level of second molar tooth on left side, and removed by disarticulation on right side. Lip and wound carefully stitched. The lip healed by
first intention and most of the wound. Patient

left hospital quite recovered 57 days after the operation. Tumour weighed 2 lbs. 2 oz. It was

an osteo-oystoma. ii. Hindu female, cet. 40.

Tumour of two

years' duration, involving the left half of the body of the lower jaw and extending beyond the symphysis to the right side. Two sinuses, the result of recent suppuration, entered the body of the tumour from outside (suppurated cysts). A straight incision was made from the left angle of the mouth, the flaps dissected off and the jaw divided at the level of the 1st bicuspid tooth of the right side and through the angle of the left. The wound was carefully stitched and healed by
first intention. Recovery was delayed somewhat by bagging of matter beneath the divided angle which was bare, and a free counter opening had to be made. She left hospital quite well 89 days after the operation. Tumour weighed 1 lb 2 oz. It was an osteo cystoma.
%* Contrary to custom the lip was divided
in both these cases. The tumours were very
large and the skin considerably thinned. Division of the lip facilitates the dissection, the division of the jaw and the seizure of bleeding points : and if the wound is carefully stitched, no deformity or inconvenience results. A large drainage tube was inserted in both cases into
the lower ano?de of the wound. This fulfils an .

important purpose by preventing the accumulation of septic material in the floor of the mouth. It also permits more thorough washing out of the wound cavity.
5. Warty tumour of the penis.?Hindu, cet. 23. The mucous membrane lining the prepuce and covering the glaus is covered with a crop of large warts forming a continuous mass, whose base is surrounded by considerable thickening. The growth of the warts followed an attack of gonorrhoea five months ago ; the prepuce cannot be retracted and a foul purulent discharge issues from the preputial orifice. The preputial cavity was slit open, and the prepuce entirely removed ; the warts were also dissected off the surface of the glans. Some

recurrence took place during t.lie healing of the wound, and a second operation was necessary. Perfect recovery eventually took place. Patient remained-in hospital 58 days.
6. Removal of piles.?In these three cases the piles were isolated by means of Smith's clamp and removed by strong curved scissors, the cut surface being seared with Paquelin's cautery. The operation was facilitated by cutting the skin and mucous membrane surrounding the pile with scissors before applying the clamp.
A satisfactory result was obtained in all the
cases.

IDENTIFICATION OF POISONOUS SNAKES.

To the Editor, " The Indian Medical Gazette."

Sir,?I shall feel much obliged if you or any of your learned readers would kindly enlighten me on the following:?1. Can bites of poisonous snakes be distinguished from those of innocent ones by their appearances 1 i.e., by the nature, number, and situation of punctures; 2. Supposing a person is bitten by a snake which is instantly killed, how can. it be known to be poisonous before any symptoms appear on the person bitten ? Can an examination of its jaw and mouth help in any way? The poisonous as well as some non-poisonous snakes have two fangs projecting from the sides of the jaw; their size of course varies in
different snakes. Are there any characteristic features
distinguising the poisonous from innocent ones? These two points are of considerable practical importance, and their knowledge is of essential service for early and effective treatment of snakebite.

^CULTURAL EXAMINATION OF THE
URINE IN KALA-AZAR.
"
By L. EVERARD NAPIER, m.r.c.s., l.r.c.p.,
and
B. M. DAS GUPTA, Sub-Assistant Surgeon.
From :?The Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine.
Our excuse for publishing this note is the fact that the success of Shortt (1923) in obtaining a pure culture of the herpetomonad
form of L,. donovani from the urine of a kala-
azar patient has led to certain statements on the possibilities of the urine being the transmitting medium of the infection of kala-azar, which are obviously absurd and which were certainly not suggested by Shortt himself.
Both writers have been interested in the
possibilities of urine being the transmitting
medium of the infection of kala-azar and with
this possibility in view made an effort last year to obtain cultures of the herpetomonad form of L. donovani from the urine of patients suffering from this disease. In conjunction with Knowles (1923) we attempted to obtain
cultures from the urine of six untreated kala-
azar patients without success. The findings of Shortt encouraged us to make another attempt. At first we took catheter specimens of urine, but we subsequently found that by carefully washing the meatus with perchloride of mercury followed by distilled water, a sterile specimen could be obtained with rather more certainty and with considerably less trouble to us and discomfort to the patient. The first few ounces of the flow of urine were discarded and then about 25 c.c.
taken into a sterile test tube. This was allow-
ed to stand for a couple of hours before a drop or two was pipetted from the bottom of the tube, including the deposit if there were any,
into 3 or 4 N.N.N, tubes which were then incubated at 22?C.

Nov., 1923.1 EXAMN. OF URINE IN KALA-AZAR : NAPIER & DAS GUPTA. 531

Sixteen specimens of urine were taken from 16 different untreated male kala-azar patients in whom the diagnosis had been made (in every case) by the demonstration of the presence of the parasite. In no case was a culture of herpctomonad forms of L. donovani obtained from
the urine. The results that we obtained were as follows:?
All the tubes became contaminated prior to the first examination in 6 cases.
At least one of the tubes remained sterile
for 9 to 12 days, subsequently becoming con-
taminated in 4 cases. Two or more of the tubes remained sterile
for a month or more in 6 cases.
We then repeated this experiment with two
more cases, but in each of these two cases we took two sterile test tubes of urine and to one
tube added two drops of blood taken from the vein of the patient at the same time. T\vo drops of blood from each patient were also placed in tubes of citrate saline, so that there
were three tubes from each of these two
patients. The deposit from each of these three
tubes was inoculated into each of three tubes of
N.N.N, medium.
The following results were obtained:?

ft

The examination was made after 9 days in-
cubation.

Conclusion.
Our previous failure in 6 cases, our present failure in 11 cases, in which the flagellates had a reasonable chance of development, and Shortt's* negative results make it clear that as a general rule a viable form of the parasite is not present in the urine of a kala-azar patient.
Under special circumstances the parasites may be present, but they are present only in the cellular deposit that has found its way into the urine on account of some pathological condition of the urinary tract. One example of such a condition can be imitated by the addi tion of a few drops of peripheral blood to the urine in vitro. The fact that the parasite is
recoverable from the urine when this has been done shows that urine does not destroy the parasites and further that the accident of an abrasion to the mucous membrane of the blad-
der or other part of. the urinary tract, by scratching by oxalate crystals or through some

*We assume that he did not make an isolated
?experiment.

other cause, could allow the escape of a viable
form of the parasite into the urine.
We do not think that this accident can
possibly have any connection whatsoever with the epidemiology of the disease.
The atypical type of the disease referred to by Shortt, in which the liver and spleen are not enlarged is by no means uncommon and forms from 1 to 2 per cent, of the general kalaazar outpatient attendance at the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, but it is probable that
the condition is much commoner than these
figures suggest. The lay public and even the medical profession associate kala-azar with a condition of enlargement of the spleen and liver, and it is natural that when these conditions are absent kala-azar is not suspected and consequently the patients do not come for treat-
ment for this disease.
There are advanced cases of kala-azar with
very large spleens, others with slightly enlarged spleens, yet others with no apparent enlargement of the spleen but enlargement of the liver and finally cases without either apparent enlargement of the spleen or liver. As these conditions of enlargement or otherwise of the spleen and liver are not associated with any other special signs and symptoms except those that are directly dependent on the enlargement of these two organs, and as all the intermediate stages of these conditions are seen, one does not seem justified in classifying them into four distinct types and certainly not in suggesting that there can be any distinction in the etiology of these types.
It is of course possible that in cases where the liver and spleen are unaffected by the disease, the kidneys bear the brunt of the attack and there is consequently not only more cellular deposit in the urine but this deposit is more highly infected with leishmania.
The discrepancy between our findings and those of Shortt can probably be accounted for by the fact that he centrifuged the urine, a procedure which we, working in the plains in the hot weather, find impossible in the interests of sterility, and thereby obtained a deposit rich in cellular elements. If this explanation is accepted our contention is further emphasised.
Our thanks are due to Major R. Knowles, t.m.s., Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, for permitting the junior writer to co-operate in this small investigation.

COMPLEMENT-FIXATION TEST WITH WITEBSKY, KLINGENSTEIN, KUHN (WKK) OR SIMILAR ANTIGENS : AMODIFIED TECHNIQUE
By P. C. SEN GUPTA, m.b. (Cal.) Officer-in-chargc, Kala-azar Research Department,
Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine A technique of a complement-fixation test for kala-azar with WKK antigen was described by Greval, Sen Gupta and Napier in 1939. The value of this test in the diagnosis of kalaazar has been assessed in the subsequent publications by the writer (Sen Gupta, 1943, 1944). In the course of his investigations on the complement-fixation test for kala-azar using antigens prepared from the so-called leprosy
bacilli of Kedrowsky and of Lleras, according to the WKK method, during the last two years,
the writer has felt that certain alterations in

the technique were advisable in order to obtain the best results with these antigens.
In the technique described by Greval, Sen Gupta and Napier, the maximum amount 01 antigen not interfering with 1 MHD of complement was determined by titration and this
was used in the test proper.
One volume of each of the gradually increasing dilutions, 1 : 10, 1 : 20, 1 : 30, etc., was titrated f?r anticomplementary activity by mixing with 1 MHD of complement in a volume and one volume of normal saline, and after proper incubation the presence of f?ee complement was detected by adding one volume of sensitized cells and incubating for half an hour.
In the course of investigations it was found that the anticomplementary titre of the antigen was markedly different if instead of one volume
of saline one volume of 1 : 25 dilution of a known
inactivated non-anticomplementary negative serum was used during the titration of the antigen. The titre was very much lower when the titration was carried out in the presence of 1]25 dilution of the serum in the amount that is present during the test proper. Also the titre was higher in the presence of volume of serum in 1/100 dilution, and highest in the absence of any serum. The amount of antigen and complement free to react was different in the two dilutions of serum used in the test proper, and some slight irregularity was seen
in some of the results obtained. It was therefore decided to titrate the anti-
gen for anticomplementary titre in the presence of 1/25 dilution of a ' negative' serum, to use only 1/25 dilution of the serum in the test proper (this ensures ' specificity' for kalaazar), and to modify the method of titration of the complement. To bring out the differences in the degrees of complement fixation it was decided to use the standard method of using two strengths of complement as in the Wassermann test. The sensitized sheep-cell suspension was prepared in accordance with the requirements of Wassermann test, method no4 of Medical Research Committee (1918) with the exception that the sheep-cell suspension was standardized according to a method described by Greval et al. (1930).
The technique that has thus been evolved has been tried in a large series of cases and has been found to be quite satisfactory. A brief description of the technique is given
below :?
1. Titration of the antigen.?0.1 c.c. of the benzolic solution of the antigen is taken up with a 1 c.c. pipette and spread on a glass mortar and allowed to dry completely. 0.2 c.c. of normal saline is then added to the residue in the mortar and a suspension is made by trituration. This forms the starting point for making the dilutions 1/10, 1/20 upwards.
In a series of test tubes labelled to show the dilutions; 1/20, 1/30, 1/40, etc., up to 1/90, put 0.25 c.c. of the
corresponding antigen dilution, 0.25 c.c. of 1/25 dilution of an inactivated negative serum, and 0.25 c.c. of complement dilution containing 1 MHD. Mix by gently shaking the tubes. Keep at room temperature for half an hour, then at 37?C. for half an hourAdd 0.25 c.c. of sensitized cells to each tube, mix?

incubate at 37?C. for half an hour; read for haemolysis. The strongest dilution of the antigen permitting a complete haemolysis corresponds to the anticomplementary activity short of 1 MHD of complement, and this is the dilution of the antigen to be used in the test
Proper. This dilution is then tested for haemolytic activity
by incubating 0.75 c.c. of this dilution with 025 c.c. ?f sensitized cell suspension. The antigen is usually found to be non-hsemolytic.
The power of fixation of the antigen is tested by putting up comparative tests with a series of known' sera using a known antigen and the new antigen.
Supposing that 1/G0 is the working dilution arrived at by titration, in order to make up the dilution needed
for the test proper, a total of 12 c.c. of saline will be required for the residue left after evaporation of 0-1 c.c. of the benzolic solution.
The titration of the antigen is not repeated daily, but the method of titration of the complement and the putting up of an antigen control during the test Proper, serves to check the correctness of the antigen titre.
2. Titration oj the complement.?1 : 10 dilution of the complement in normal saline is first prepared. From this 1/20, 1/30, 1/40, 1/50, . . . 1/120 dilutions are made. Two rows of tubes are set up on a rack to correspond to these dilutions of the complement. Two tubes, one behind the other, correspond to each dilution. In the tubes of the first row are placed 0.25 c.c. of the corresponding complement dilution and 0.5 c.c. of normal saline. In the tubes of the back row are put 0-25 c.c. each of the corresponding complement dilution, V25 dilution of inactivated negative serum, and the forking dilution of the antigen. The tubes are kept at room temperature for half an hour, then incubated at 37?C. for half an hour. Then 0.25 c.c. of sensitized
sheep cells is added to each tube and these are
'ncubated at 37?C. for half an hour, after which the fninimum haemolytic dose (MHD) of the complement 13 read. This is taken as the highest dilution at which there is complete lysis of the sheep cells. The tubes in the two rows usually show a similar degree of lysis. If there is a disagreement in the titre as indicated in the
two-rows, this is usually due to the defect in the antigen dilution, and can be rectified by again titrating the
antigen against 1 MHD of complement in the presence of 1/25 dilution of a negative serum, and using the antigen in the new working dilution thus obtained.
3. The test -proper.?The serum to be tested is ?nactivated to destroj^ the complement by heating to ?5?C. for half an hour in a water bath. 1 : 25 dilution ls prepared by mixing 0.1 c.c. of serum with 2.4 c.c. of normal saline.
The antigen dilution is made up as described previously {vide supra).-
Two strengths of complement dilution are made so as to contain 2 MHD and 5 MHD in a volume. Suppose 1 : 80 is the titre (MHD) of the complement, a 1 : 40 solution of the complement will contain 2 MHD and a 1 : 16 solution 5 MHD in a volume.
Three tubes, placed one behind the other, are required lor testing each serum; the first tube is for serum control with 2 MHD of complement, the second and the third for the test with the antigen and 2 and 0 MHD of complement respectively.

Add sensitized sheep cells 0.25 c.c. to each tube, mix; incubate at 37?C. for half an hour. Read for haemolysis.
The following general controls are put up along with the test proper
1. Antigen control : 0.25 c.c. of each of the following : antigen dilution, 1/25 dilution of negative serum, 1 MHD of complement.
2. Negative serum control : same as 1 but 2 MHD of complement is used.
3. Positive serum control : a known positive serum put up as in the test proper.
4. Cell suspension control : 0.25 c.c. of cell suspension put up with 0.75 c.c. of normal
saline.

different tubes is read as follows :?

A trace of lysis is detected by leaving the tube in a refrigerator overnight to allow the
cells to settle down to the bottom of the tube.

The control tubes 1 and 2 should show com-

plete lysis ; the positive serum control should

show no lysis with 2 and 5 MHD complement ;

the cell suspension tube should show no lysis.

Any serum that shows any inhibition of lysis

in the serum control tube is to be regarded as

anticomplementary ; the other tubes are of no

value; no opinion as to fixation of the comple-

ment by this serum in the presence of antigen

can be given.

With complete lysis in the serum control

tube, complete inhibition of lysis with 2 MHD

of complement along with complete or almost

complete inhibition (?T) with 5 MHD is

reported

as

'

complete

inhi-

bition of lysis with 2 MHD, with partial or no

inhibition with 5 MHD, is reported as

'positive'; a trace of lysis or partial lysis with

2 MHD, with partial or no inhibition with 5

MHD, is reported as 'doubtful'; and complete

or almost complete lysis with 2 MHD comple-

ment as ' negative'.

Significance
As pointed out in the previous publications on the subject of complcment-fixation test for kala-azar by the writer, in the absence of severe (lepromatous) leprosy and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, a positive or strongly posi-
tive reaction with this test is indicative of
kala-azar. It should be borne in mind, however, that a very small proportion of clinically obvious cases of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis gives a positive reaction. This is not a serious drawback. The doubtful reaction is regarded
as an indication for further clinical and para-
sitological investigation. A negative reaction almost rules out kala-azar except in some very

398

early cases. A negative reaction is obtained in only about 1 per cent of all untreated cases of
kala-azar seen in Calcutta.
The advantages of this technique This technique has the advantage that the antigen and the complement are titrated under
the exact conditions that exist in the test proper. The titrations are carried out in such
a way that there are exactly 2 and 5 MHD of complement free to react. The adoption of the serum dilution of 1 : 25 ensures ' specificity ' of the test for kala-azar as in the previous technique described by Greval, the writer and Napier. The use of two strengths of the complement in differentiating the degrees of posi-
tive reaction is in line with the standard Bri-
tish methods of the Wassermann test. Also, this technique is much less time-consuming than the previously described method, because only
one dilution of the serum has to be made. The
amount of complement required is somewhat
more.
The writer is thankful to Dr. Dharmendra, officer-incharge of the Leprosy Research Department, and to Mr. R. Bose, the chemist of the same department, for kindly preparing for him several batches of the antigens from the different acid-fast bacilli.

SMITH'S OPERATION,

To the Editor of " The Indian Medical Gazette."

Sir,?In the present unsettled state of opinion, it seems the duty of every mail, who has made a fair trial of Smith's operation for cataract, to give his opinion thereon. After an experience of about five hundred operations on the old lines, I tried extraction in the capsule from Colonel Smith's description, and was well satisfied with the result in comparison with the old operation. As I had an unduly large escape of vitreous, I visited Amritsar and was kindly shown by Lieutenant-Colonel Smith the exact technique. I have done over fifteen hundred operations 011 his lines and am very much pleased with the result. My percentage of vitreous escape is about eight per cent.; and I can say that a moderate loss does not seem to effect the subsequent vision. The great and chief advantage is the practical abolition of iritis. A large proportion of my cases were operated on in Branch Dispensaries, and the cases left to the care of SubAssistant Surgeons. I would never have dared to have performed the old operation under those circumstances owing to the great amount of care needed in the after-treatment. Practically the only complication is a somewhat increased tendency to prolapse of the iris ; but with increased experience in the art of properly replacing it, which has been erroneously called "stirring up the vitreous," the incidence of this complication has much diminished ; I learn, by hearsay that a number of men, doing what they call Smith's operation have a 40 or 50 per cent, escape of vitreous. Although a moderate vitreous loss is not a disaster, as it was deemed

in the old days, it is undesirable mainly because it causes

increased change of iris prolapse, and I would strongly

advice any man with a large percentage of vitreous loss to

\JSit Colonel Smith who, I am sure, would be glad to show

Xim the best way of doing the operation. In conclusion,

I would like to thanjc him warmly for his valuable aid and

advice.

This study included patients who visited the department of prosthodontics at four university dental hospitals for maxillofacial prosthetic rehabilitation. Patients with facial and congenital defects or with insufficient medical data were excluded. The patients were classified into three categories based on the location of the defect. Patients' sex, age, and residential area were analyzed. Pearson's chi-square test with a significance level of 0.05 was used to analyze the variables. RESULTS. Among 540 patients with maxillofacial prosthetics, there were 284 (52.59%) male patients and 256 (47.41%) female patients. The number of the patients varied greatly by hospital. Most patients were older than 70, and the most common defect was a hard palate defect. Chi-square analysis did not identify any significant differences in sex, age, and distance to hospital for any defect group (P>.05). CONCLUSION. The results of this study indicated that there was imbalance in the distribution of patients with maxillofacial prosthetic among the hospitals in the capital region of Korea. Considerations on specialists and insurance policies for the improvement of maxillofacial prosthetics in Korea are required. [ J Adv Prosthodont 2016;8:229-34]

against cancer since then, and treatments for oral and maxillofacial cancer, including maxillectomy and mandibulectomy, have increased survival rates. The primary objectives of cancer treatment are curing the disease and preventing any recurrence.3 Although treatments for cancer in the head and neck area have been developed and treatments including radiation therapy and chemotherapy have been introduced, surgical resection is still the primary treatment option.3,4 After ablative surgery for cancer, defects occur in head and neck structures, and maxillofacial prosthetics are required to correct these. Maxillofacial prosthetics is a branch of prosthodontics concerned with the restoration and/or replacement of stomatognathic and craniofacial structures with prostheses.5,6
The objectives of maxillofacial prosthetics are the restoration of oral and maxillofacial function, preservation of residual structures after surgical treatment, and enhance-

ment of orofacial esthetics.6,7 These are important because they help patients with their social life after treatment.6,8 Maxillofacial prosthetics is the most important method of rehabilitation and is beneficial to patients. It provides nonsurgical rehabilitation for patients who have anatomical or physiologic defects due to congenital deficiency, trauma, or neoplasm. Maxillofacial prosthetics is associated with the speech, mastication, deglutition functions, and esthetics7,9,10 and has several advantages over surgical intervention. It can provide better esthetic results, which cannot be achieved with surgical reconstruction. It is also less invasive and helps patients avoid surgery. In addition, it provides predictable and cheaper treatment, less morbidity to patients, and a reasonable level of functional restoration.8,11 Maxillofacial prosthetics is important in allowing patients to rejoin society.6,8 Though these treatments can be challenging, physicians find this to be a rewarding clinical area.
Maxillofacial prosthetics for acquired defects can be classified into several categories.7,9 Based on the location, oral and maxillofacial defects can be divided into intraoral and extraoral (facial) defects. Acquired intraoral defects can be classified into maxillary and mandibular defects.11 As the rehabilitation of hard palate defect differs from that of velopharyngeal defects, acquired hard palate defects need to be separated from acquired soft palate defects.
According to the statistics reported by Korea Central Cancer Registry and the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare in 2015, there were 3,176 estimated new cancers in the lip, oral cavity and pharynx, in 2,339 males and 837 females.12 Because all patients who previously had resective surgery as a treatment of maxillofacial cancer do not necessarily have defects and receive prosthetic treatment, it is important to identify the number of patients with significant maxillofacial defects. The number of the patients who had specific disease and were treated in the hospital can be influenced by various factors, including preparation of the adequate facilities, existence of the specialists, or dental policies set by the government. Therefore, collection of data related to maxillofacial prosthetics in Korea might contribute to the preparation of treatment plans for patients with maxillofacial defects, establishment of treatment procedures in maxillofacial prosthetics, and improvement of maxillofacial prosthetics techniques, and may provide the basis for new policies to help these patients, including insurance.
There are regional variations in the incidence of head and neck cancer.3,13-15 Patients with maxillofacial prosthetic were analyzed based on geographic region and hospital to obtain additional information on health policy related to cancer treatment. Since most maxillofacial defects are acquired defects from head and neck cancer, the incidence of maxillofacial prosthetics might be influenced by different regions in Korea. As serious functional problems related to basic survival and social life may arise with maxillofacial defects, maxillofacial prosthetics treatment is one of the most important treatments in dentistry. However, there have been no studies on the incidence of maxillofacial

prosthetics treatment in Korea. The purpose of this study was to investigate the demo-
graphic patterns and types of maxillofacial prosthetic treatment, to find out the distribution of patients with maxillofacial prosthetics based on hospitals in the capital region, and to provide information on maxillofacial prosthetics to inform decisions on treatment priorities and insurance policies in Korea.
Materials and Methods
This retrospective analytical multicenter study was done through chart reviews on patients at four university dental hospitals in Korea's large cities. Patients who visited the department of prosthodontics in dental hospitals for the replacement of stomatognathic and craniofacial structures using maxillofacial prostheses were analyzed. They were classified into three categories based on the location of the defect. The data was also analyzed in terms of sex, age, and the defect location. In addition, patients' residential area and their choice of the hospitals were analyzed.
In this cross-sectional study, patients who got maxillofacial prosthetic treatment in the capital region of Korea were analyzed. The Seoul Capital area includes Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi-do administrative districts and has a population of 25.05 million people, out of 50.62 million in Korea. It occupies more than 49.48% of the population, according to the results of the 2015 population and housing census by the Korea National Statistical Office. Patients from all over the nation are able to visit hospitals in the capital region for cancer-related diseases due to the development of transportation such as high-speed railway system. Considering that maxillofacial prosthetic rehabilitation is a difficult treatment in private dental offices, university dental hospitals in the capital region likely represent most maxillofacial prosthetics in Korea.7 Seoul National University Dental Hospital, Yonsei University Dental Hospital, Kyung Hee University Dental Hospital, and Dankook University Dental Hospital in Chonan were selected. Although Dankook University Dental Hospital is located in Chonan of the Chungcheong province, it was included because many people consider it to be within the capital area due to the development of transportation system and because it is in the same economic bloc. Moreover, as Dankook University Dental Hospital is one of the biggest dental hospitals that patients with maxillofacial prosthetics are likely to visit, it was included in this analysis.
Records of the patients who visited the department of prosthodontics for maxillofacial prosthetic rehabilitation were obtained and reviewed. To analyze patients with acquired intraoral maxillofacial defects, data from January of 2010 to December of 2014 was collected. Facial and congenital defects were excluded from this study, as there were very few patients with these. Patients whose data were insufficient for the analysis were also excluded. Acquired intraoral maxillofacial defects were divided into three categories based on the location of the defect: hard palate

defect, mandibular defect, and soft palate defect. When the patients had both hard palate and mandibular defects at the same time, they were included in both categories. When the hard palate and mandibular defect were combined with a soft palate defect, it was assumed to originate from the hard palate or mandibular defect. Patients classified with a soft palate defect had a defect exclusively in that region.
Information on patient age, sex, address, and the type of defect was collected and analyzed. After the patients were classified into hard palate, mandible, and soft palate defect groups, they were analyzed based on the patient's age and gender. The patients were divided into 8 age groups: 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, and over 71. Proportions were used to describe the gender and age frequencies of the patients. Pearson's chi-square test with a significance level of 0.05 was used to analyze the relationship between the defect and gender and between the defect and age using a statistical software package (SPSS 12, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The patients' addresses were also collected to investigate whether they came from distant areas or from areas near the hospitals. The patients in Seoul National University Dental Hospital were subjected to analysis related to their residential area. Patients who visited Seoul National University Hospitals were classified into two categories. If patients came from capital region, that is, from Seoul or Gyeonggi province, the patients were regarded as close distance patients. Patients from other areas were classified as long distance patients. Pearson's chi-square test with a significance level of 0.05 was used for to analyze whether defects were related to the distance from the hospital.
A detailed analysis of each defect type will be presented in succeeding studies. The protocol of this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University (No. S-D20150021).
Results
Five-hundred and forty maxillofacial prosthetics patients were analyzed, with slightly more male patients than female patients. There were 284 male patients (52.59%) and 256 female patients (47.41%). The number of maxillofacial prosthetics patients varied greatly by hospital. Seoul

National University had the greatest number of patients. Table 1 shows the total number of patients at the four dental hospitals.
Patients' ages ranged from 12 to 93. There were 163 patients over 70 years old, which was the largest age group. The next largest age group was the 61-70 group, followed by the patients aged between 51 and 60 (Fig. 1). In general, the number of patients increased with age. All defect groups showed the same trends. Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 show age distribution based on the defect in four dental hospitals.
When the patients were classified based on the defect, most patients had a hard palate defect, followed by mandibular defect and soft palate defect. 321 patients had a maxillary defect, 17 patients had a soft palate defect, and 202 patients had a mandibular defect. The number of the male and female patients based on the defect is summarized in Table 5.
In statistical analysis using Pearson's chi-square test, there was no significant difference in the defect types based on gender (P > .05) and age (P > .05). However, patient age showed a normal distribution. Out of 483 patients who visited the Seoul National Dental Hospital, 322 patients came

from a close distance (66.53%) and 162 patients came from a long distance (33.47%). There was no significant difference in the travel distance based on hard palate defects, soft palate defects, or mandibular defects (P > .05).
Discussion
According to a report by Korea Central Cancer Registry and Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, males had a larger number of estimated first-time cancers, with a male to female ratio of nearly 3:1.12 This was not in accordance with the number of patients with maxillofacial prosthetics in this study, which had a similar number of male and female patients. Therefore, it can be assumed that patients with maxillofacial prosthetics do not coincide exactly with the occurrence of neoplasms. The variety of the neoplasm types, treatment methods, and treatment timing may be responsible for this.
Other than malignant neoplasms, trauma, benign tumors, and infection can cause defects that require prosthetic treatment.16,17 However, in the preliminary survey for this study, most defects originated from treatment for maxillofacial cancer, and other causes of the defects were not noticeable. The origin of the defect was not considered in this study.
The results of the study show that the number of patients with maxillofacial prosthetics is closely related to age. Head and neck cancer is related to an increase in age.18,19 Age is important in maxillofacial prosthetics because techniques or materials can be limited and can both influence the treatment plan in geriatric patients.20 Furthermore, it is important to consider general health condition when treating geriatric patients.
Most patients had a hard palate defect, followed by mandibular defects and soft palate defects. Patients with facial defects and congenital anomalies are expected to seek prosthodontic treatments. However, it was difficult to find such patients. Considering that maxillofacial prosthetic patients are more likely to go to big dental hospitals instead of choosing local dental clinics due to the difficulty of the treatment, it was strange that patients with facial and congenital defects were difficult to find.
In this study, only the number of new patients was counted. However, when clinic time is considered, patient visits and time spent may have been overestimated since maxillofacial prosthetics patients need to be rechecked more often than general prosthodontic patients and maxillofacial prostheses can be fabricated repeatedly. Among the hospitals that participated in this survey, Seoul National University Dental Hospital had the largest number of maxillofacial prosthetics patients. There was an extremely uneven patient distribution, potentially due to the small size of the country and the transportation like a high-speed railway system. In addition, patients seemed to go to the department of prosthodontics that belonged to the hospital where they had the surgery. The number of the patients with maxillofacial prosthetics was also influenced by the

activities of the surgeons in the hospital. However, balanced development of the hospitals and the education of future maxillofacial prosthodontists are necessary to provide high quality treatment for maxillofacial patients in Korea. Specialized hospitals with experienced prosthodontists are essential for maxillofacial prosthetic treatment related to the restoration of facial esthetics, basic functions, and social life. The absence of appropriate dental hospitals for maxillofacial prosthetics can lead to several problems including discontinuity of care and lost opportunities for treatment. An imbalance of institutions that can provide maxillofacial prosthetics can affect social welfare budgets due to inefficient use of dental insurance services. Patients can also experience inconvenience, such as long waiting time, due the congestion of patients at a particular site. Although problems related to maxillofacial prosthetics are distant from the `dental tourism' issue, patients who have trouble finding an appropriate hospital may seek foreign hospitals to obtain the appropriate maxillofacial prosthetic treatment.21
The distribution and the number of the patients and the patterns of treatment are influenced by the dental insurance system provided by the government. Coverage of maxillofacial prosthetics by insurance is necessary because the severity of the defect can impact quality of life and can be a social issue. In addition, the capacity of the dental hospitals is limited, so resources have to be distributed efficiently. Insurance coverage of maxillofacial prosthetics can help to identify the patients in need and may help with predictions to guide future public health policies.
This study was performed with only four dental hospitals in the capital region of Korea. Although almost half of the total Korean population lives in the Seoul capital region, the exclusion of dental hospitals in eastern and southern regions of Korea would be the limitation of this study. Defect patterns and important factors in treatment can change with the development of technology. Further studies, including nationwide demographic studies on maxillofacial prosthetics, long-term studies showing changes in factors related to the patients needing treatment, and studies establishing patient records forms, are needed. In addition, defining the roles of general dentists in local communities and developing a referral system for these patients are needed. Analysis of the socioeconomic status of patients with oral and maxillofacial defects would be beneficial for the patients and would help form government policy.
Conclusion
More than 500 patients needing maxillofacial prosthetics were treated at four university dental hospitals in the capital region of Korea over the past 5 years. Characteristics of this special treatment, including defect patterns and their age-dependent trends, should be considered in treatment. The results of this study indicated that there was a severe imbalance in the distribution of patients with maxillofacial prosthetics among the hospitals in the capital region of

Korea. Considerations on specialists and insurance policies for the improvement of maxillofacial prosthetics in Korea are required. Although maxillofacial patients are more likely to be treated in large hospitals, the roles of local dental clinics should be defined as well.

Identification of Microtubule-associated Proteins in The Centrosome, Spindle, and Kinetochore of
The Early DrosophilaEmbryo
Douglas R. Kellogg, Christine M. Field, and Bruce M. Alberts Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143

Abstract. We have developed affinity chromatography
methods for the isolation of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) from soluble cytoplasmic extracts and have used them to analyze the cytoskeleton of the
early Drosophila embryo. More than 50 Drosophila
embryo proteins bind to microtubule affinity columns. To begin to characterize these proteins, we have generated individual mouse polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognize 24 of them. As judged by immunofluorescence, some of the antigens localize to the

mitotic spindle in the early Drosophila embryo, while
others are present in centrosomes, kinetochores, subsets of microtubules, or a combination of these structures. Since 20 of the 24 antibodies stain microtubule structures, it is likely that most of the proteins that bind to our columns are associated with microtubules in vivo. Very few MAPS seem to be identically localized in the cell, indicating that the microtubule cytoskeleton is remarkably complex.

M ICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATEDproteins (MAPs)~ are thought to play a central role in determining the structure and function of microtubule networks in eukaryotic cells. MAPs were originally identified in mammalian brain tissue extracts as abundant proteins that cosediment with microtubules (for reviews, see Vallee et al., 1984; Olmstead, 1986). More recently, similar criteria have been used to identify MAPs in a number of nonneuronal systems (Vallee and Collins, 1986; Goldstein et al., 1986; Lye et al., 1987).
None of the MAPs that cosediment with microtubules have been found to localize to the centrosome or the kinetochore, two extensively studied microtubule-organizing centers in the cell. Most MAPs that have been identified thus far are relatively abundant proteins that bind along the entire length of microtubules (Vallee and Bloom, 1983; Bloom et al., 1984; Huber and Matus, 1984; Binder et al., 1985). MAPs that function as components of the centrosome or the kinetochore would be expected to be present only near the ends of microtubules, and are therefore likely to be much less abundant. These low abundance MAPs may be difficult to detect by current methods.
We have developed procedures for the isolation of MAPs by microtubule affinity chromatography, with the hope that even minor proteins that bind to microtubules can be identified and characterized. Previous work has shown that affinity chromatography is a powerful technique for the identification, purification, and characterization of interact-

ing proteins (for examples, see Formosa and Alberts, 1984; Dedhar et al., 1987). We have used our technique to isolate a large number of previously uncharacterized MAPs from
the early Drosophila embryo, which seems to provide an
especially good model system for studying cytoskeletal functions.
The Drosophila embryo begins development as a giant
syncytial cell. The earliest nuclear divisions occur in the interior of the embryo, but, after nine nuclear divisions, the majority of the nuclei have migrated to the cortex where they form an evenly spaced monolayer. The nuclei in this monolayer divide four more times and then become synchronously cellularized by invaginations of the plasma membrane to form the cellular blastoderm (Rabinowitz, 1941; Zalokar and Erk, 1976; Foe and Alberts, 1983). The nuclear divisions that precede this cellular blastoderm stage take place at intervals of 8-20 min, and the dynamic rearrangements of the microtubule arrays during each nuclear cycle can be observed in living embryos after injection of fluorescently-labeled tubulin subunits (Kellogg et al., 1988). Large quantifies of early embryos are readily available for biochemical analyses, and these embryos are also amenable to irnmunofluorescence, microinjection, and genetic studies.
These factors combine to make the early Drosophilaembryo
an attractive system in which to study the morphogenesis of microtubule arrays and their role in embryonic development.
To begin a characterization of the afffinlty-purified Drosophila embryo MAPs, we have made a library of mouse
polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognize 24 of them. These antibodies have allowed us to determine the subcellular localizations of the affinity-purified proteins in embryos.

The results suggest that the majority of the many proteins that bind to microtubule affinity columns are associated with microtubules in the cell, and they have allowed us to identify MAPs that localize to centrosomes and kinetochores.

Purificationof Drosophila Tubulin
Tubulin is purified from early Drosophila embryos by procedures modified from those used by Detrich and Wilson (1983) to purify tubulin from sea urchin embryos. As starting material, we use 0-3-h collections of embr~s that have been frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C. Frozen chunks of embryos are placed between several layers of aiuminum foil, crushed with a hammer, and added to 2 vol of PMI buffer at 15°C containing protease inhibitor stock (1:100). After stirring briefly, PMSF is added to 1 mM, and the embryos are homogenized by several passes of a motor-driven teflon dounce at 4°C. After the crude homogenate is clarified by centrifugation at 100,0008 for 70 min, the supernataut is brought to 0.5 mM DTT and mixed with 0.5 vol of packed phosphocellniose (Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ), previously equilibrated with PMIX buffer. After 30 min of gentle mixing on a rotator, the pbosphocellulose resin is pelleted by centrifugation for several rain at 1,000 g, and the supematant is saved. The phosphocellulose is washed twice with 0.5 vol of PMIX buffer, and these supernatants are combined with the first superuatant.
The tubulin in the above supernatants is bound to DEAE cellulose by adding the superuatant to 0.33 vol of pecked DEAE cellulose (DE52; Whatman Inc.) previously equilibrated with PMIX buffer. After gently mixing the DEAE cellulose and the extracton a rotator for 30 rain, the DEAE cellulose is pelleted and washed two times with 0.5 vol of PMIX buffer. A slurry of the resin is poured into a column (3.5-cm-diam for 150 mi of DEAE cellulose) and washed with 2 column vul of PMIX.1 buffer containing 0.15 M NaCI. Tubniin is then einted from the DEAE cellulose column with PMIX.I buffer containing 0.4 M NaCI. Fractions of 2-3 mi are collected at a flow rate of 2 column vol/h. The eluted fractions are assayed for protein (Bradford, 1976), and peak fractions are pooled and dialyzed for 40 min against I0 vol of BRBg0 buffer containing 0.5 mM DTT, followed by another 40 min against fresh buffer. If the protein concentration is below 2 mg/ml at this point, the solution is concentrated using an ultraiiltrationdevice (Amicon Corp., Danvers, MA). Tubulin is polymerized into microtubnies by addition ofG T P to 1.0 mM, MgCI2 to 4 raM, and DMSO'to I0%, followed by incubation at 25°C for 40 rain. The microtubules are collected by cen-

trifugationthrough a 50% sucrose cushion in BRBS0 at 150,000 g for 60 rainat25°C. The microtubulesare resuspended to ,v5 mg/ml inBRBS0 and depolymerized by incubationon ice for 30 min. After insolublematerialis removed by centrifugationat I00,000 g for 30 rain,the tubulin solutionis eitherquicklyfrozenon liquidnitrogenand storedat -70°C or used directly forcolumn construction(seebelow). All stepsare carriedout at4°C, except where noted.
Taxoi-inducedAssembly o f Microtubules
To form taxol-stabilized microtubules for the construction of microtubule affinity columns, tubniin at 2-3 mg/ml in BRBg0 is assembled into microtubules by addition of 1 mM GTP, followed by step-wise addition of taxoi. The taxol-induced polymerization of tubulin is carried out gradually in order to prevent the formation of aberrant structures (Schiffet al., 1979). An initial aliquot of taxol is added to bring the taxol concentration to 0.15/~M, followed by a 10-rain incubation at 25°C (Drosophila tubulin) or 37°C (bovine tubulin). Three additional aiiquots of taxol are then added over a 25 rain period to bring the final taxol concentration to 1, 5, and 20 ~tM, respectively. At the end of the assembly reaction, the microtubule solution is chilled on ice.
The taxol-induced polymerization of tubulin is carried out in a standard microtubule assembly buffer (Pipes buffer, pH 6.8 [BRBg0]). Because coupling of microtubnies to the activated agarose matrix (see below) takes place inefficiently at pH 6.8, the pH of the microtubule solution is adjusted to 7.6 by addition of small aiiquots of 2 M KOH just before coupling.
ConstructionofMicrotubuleA~nity Columns
The agarose matrix used for construction of microtubule affinity columns consists of a l:l mixture of affigel l0 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Cambridge, MA) and Sepbarose CL6B (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ). Affigel l0 is an agarose matrix activated for coupling to protein by the presence of N-hydroxysnccinimide groups, and the CL6B is an inert agarose matrix that is included to create a more porous column with improved flow properties (Miller and Alberts, 1989). We generally construct columns in sterile plastic syringes (Becton Dickinson & Co., MountainView, CA) fitted with polypropylene discs (Ace Glass, Inc., Vineland, NJ) as bed supports. The cross-sectional area of the column is increased according to the column volume using a 6-ml syringe for a 3-ml column, a 12-ml syringe for a 6-ml column, and so on.
An 18-gange syringe needle fitted with a syringe of appropriate size is pushed through a rubber stopper on top of a filter flask to which suction can be applied. Equal settled volumes of CL6B and affigel I0 are poured into the syringe and washed several times with water at 4°C, with periodic stirring. Care is taken not to draw air into the column matrix throughout these and the following procedures. After storage for I h at 4°C to inactivate the affigel resin partially (overcoupling of the microtubules leads to a significant decrease in the binding capacity of the affinity matrix), the column bed is washed twice with C buffer in the manner described above. After the third wash, the buffer is drawn down to a level just above the surface of the column bed and the column is removed from the rubber stopper and sealed at the bottom. About 0.5 column volumes of a 2-3 mg/mi solution of taxul-stabilized microtubulesat pH 7.6 (see above) is added, followed by thorough stirring with a teflon rod. The column is left undisturbed for 4-15 h at 4°C to allow coupling to occur, and then washed with several column vol of C buffer containing I0 mM ethanolamine (added from a 3-M stock, redistilled, and adjusted to pH 8) to block unreacted groups, followed by C buffer containing 1.0 mM DTT and 0.5 M KCI (flow rate of I-2 column voi/h). The washes are saved and assayed for protein to determine the amount of tubulin bound to the column.
Our procedure generally causes ,~60-75 % of the input microtubule protein to bind to the column. The columns are stored at 4°C in BRBg0 containing 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 5 ttM taxol, aiid 0.02% sodium azide, and can be used for at least five experiments over a l-ran period without a detectable change in their properties. For controls, BSA columns were prepared as described by Miller and Alberts (1989). We did not construct tubulin dimer control columns because of difficulties in obtaining purified stable tubniin dimers (Wilson, 1970; Weingarten et ai., 1974).
Preparationof DrosophilaEmbryoExtractsfor MicrotubuleA~inity Chromatography
The extracts for our affinity chromatography experiments are prepared from living 2-3-h collections of DrosophUa embryos (i.e., embryos are between

0 and 3 h postfertilization). The embryos are collected, dechorionated, and washed extensively with distilled water as previously described (Miller and AIberts, 1989). They are then suspended in 10 vol of C buffer containing 0.05% NP-40 and protease inhibitor stock (1:100). PMSF is added to I mM and the embryos are homogenized by several passes of a motor driven teflon dounce homogenizer. (Selection of a loose fitting pestle prevents disruption of yolk granules.) The embryo homogenate is centrifuged for 10 rain at 12,000 g, followed by 60 rain at 101X000g. A thin floating layer on the surface of the final supernatant is removed by aspiration, and DTT is added to 0.5 mM before loading the extract onto affinity columns (see below). All steps are carried out at 40C.
Microtubule Affinity Chromatography
Embryo extracts are loaded onto affinity columns at 0.5-1 column vol/h. After loading, the columns are washed with 3-4 column vol of CX buffer, and then eluted in succession with this buffer plus either 1 mM MgATP, 0.1 M KCI, or 0.5 M KC1. The wash and elutions steps are carried out at 2 column vol/h, and all chromatography steps are at 4"C.
After the protein concentration in each fraction is determined (Bradford, 1976), the peak fractions are pooled. The protein in each pool is precipitated with 10% TCA as described by Miller and Alberts (1989), resuspended in gel sample buffer (0.5 ml for the eluate from a 15-ml column), and neutralized with the vapor from a Q-tip soaked in ammonium hydroxide. The pellets are solubilized by incubation at 50oc for 30 min, followed by 100°C for 3 rain, each is then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970), using Coomassie blue staining to visualize protein bands.
Cosedimentation of MAPs with Taxol-stabilized Microtubules
As an alternative to microtubule affinity chromatography, MAPs were isolated by virtue of their ability to cosediment with taxoi-stabilized microtubules, using the procedures described by Vallee and Collins (1986). Briefly, 0-3-h embryos (dechorionated and washed as described above) are added to 2 vol of BRBSObuffer containing protease inhibitor stock (1:100). After PMSF is added to 1 mM, the embryos are homogenized at 40C, and the extract is clarified as described earlier. The supernatant is supplemented with 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM GTP, 20 ttM taxoi, warmed to 25"C for 5 rain, and then transferred to ice for 15 min to allow polymerization of the endogenous tubulin. The taxol-stabilized microtubules and their associated proteins are collected by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion (BRBSOX containing 10% sucrose) at 48,000 g for 30 min at 4°C. The pellet is washed twice at 4"C by resuspension in 0.2 times the original extract volume of BRB80X buffer, followed by a second centrifugntion through a sucrose cushion. MAPs are dissociated from the microtubules by resuspending the final pellet in BRB80X buffer containing 1 mM ATP and 0.5 M KC! (0.07 times the original extract volume) at 25"C. The microtubules are removed by centrifngation at 45,000 g for 15 min at 20"C, and the MAP-containing supernatant is saved. Release of the MAPs at 25"C prevents dissociation of tubulin subunits (see Vallee and Collins, 1986).
Isolation of MAPs in a pH 7.6 Hepes buffer (see text) is carried out in the same manner, except that the BRB80 buffer is replaced by C buffer, BRB80X buffer is replaced by CX buffer, and the release of the MAPs from microtubules is carried out at 4°C, since taxoi-stabilized microtubules are more stable when exposed to ATP and KCI in the pH 7.6 Hepes buffer.
Generation of Mouse PolycionalAntibodies to Gel-Purified Proteins
We have produced mouse polyclonal antibodies using procedures modified from those of Amero et al. (1987). A total of ,~,1.6 nag of affinity-purified MAPs are separated on two preparative 7-12%, 14.5 cm × 22 cm, SDScontaining polyacrylamide gradient gels (0.82-mm thick). The gels are stained with Coomassie blue, destained for 0.5 h, and treated with a solution of 2% glutaraldehyde in water for 1 h at 25"C. The gels are then transferred to 7% acetic acid to complete the destaining procedure. After soaking in water to remove the acetic acid, bands of interest are excised with a razor blade and homogenized with a motor-driven teflon dounce homogenizer in the presence of a small amount of water. The homogenized gel bands are then lyophilized and resuspended in 1.5 ml of sterile PBS.
Each gel slice is used for a total of four immunizations given intraperitoneally with a 22-geuge needle and spaced at 2-wk intervals. The first immunization is with 0.45 ml of homogenized gel slice slurry and 0.1 ml

of complete Freund's adjuvant, while the remaining three immunizations use 0.34 ml of the slurry and 0.1 ml of incomplete Freund's adjuvant. (The adjuvant mixtures are warmed to 370C and vortexed vigorously before loading into the syringe). Beginning I wk after the final immunization, the mice are bled intraorbitally every 7-10 d, and the sent are tested for the presence of specific antibodies. Mice are anesthetized with ether before all immunizations and bleeds.
Western Blotting
Proteins were detected by western blotting according to standard procedures (Towbin, 1979). Approximately 0.15 mg of crude extract protein or afffinitypurified MAPs are electrophoresed on a preparative minigel (8 x 6 x 0.5 mm) and then transferred from the gel to a sheet of 0.45 /tin porosity nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell Inc., Keene, NH) in the presence of 25% methanol, 0.15 M glycine, 0.02% SDS (transfer for 90 rain at 300 rnA in a Hoeffer electroblottingapparatus). The nitrocellulose sheet is incubated for 45 min in TBS containing 5% BSA and 0.02% sodium azide and then placed in a miniblotterapparatus (lmmunetics, Cambridge, MA). Each lane of this miniblotteris loaded with 55 t~lof antibody diluted into TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 detergent (Bio-Rad), 5% BSA, and 0.02% sodium azide, and the miniblotteris then placed on a rocker platform for 2 h at room temperature. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody is used to visualize protein bands. To reduce nonspecific background staining, this secondary antibody was preadsorbed to methanol-fixed embryos by diluting the antibody into ~1 ml of TBS containing 0.5 ml (settled volume) of methanol-fixed embryos. After mixing on a rotating wheel (60 min, 25°C), the soluble antibody is diluted to its final working concentration and used immediately.
l~xation and IramunofluorescentStainingof Drosophila Embryos
Methanol is the fixative that best preserves microtubule structures in the Drosophila embryo (Warn and Warn, 1986; Kellogg et al., 1988). For immunofluorescence staining, the methanol-fixed embryos are incubated in PBS containing 5% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.02% sodium azide for 20 min. The embryos are then incubated overnightat 4"C in a 1:400 dilution of immune mouse serum in PBS containing 5% albumin, 0.1% Tween, and 0.02% sodium azide. These embryos are washed and treated with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody as described by Karr and Alberts (1986).
Affinity Purification of Antibodies
Affinity purification of antibodies using nitrocellulose-bound antigen was carried out according to procedures described by Smith and Fisher (1984), with modifications. Affinity-purified MAPs are resolved on two preparative minigels and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. The location of the desired protein band is determined by using a miniblotter to treat the lanes on both edges of the nitrocellulose sheet with primary antibody. After staining with alkalinephosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, the central strip of unstained nitrocellulose that corresponds to the desired protein band is excised and cut up into small pieces, which are placed into a 1.5-ml tube. We used the 190-kD band to affinity purify the SI-24 antibody, the 105- and 89-kD bands for the SI-24 antibody, and the 190-kD band for the $5-47 antibody (see Fig. 6 A). These pieces are washed with PBS and incubated for 30 min at 25°C in PBS containing 5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.02% sodium azide. The nitrocellulose pieces are then incubated in the primary antibody (0.5 ml of a 1:500 dilution of serom) for 1.5 h at 25"C with gentle mixing. After several 5-rain washes in TBS containing 0.05 % Tween 20, the antibody is eluted from the nitrocellulose with two 30-s washes of 0.25 ml of 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.3, 0.4 M NaCI, 100 ttg/ml BSA, 0.05 % Tween 20, accompanied by gentle vortexing. The washes are pooled and immediately neutralized by addition of 0.5 mi PBS containing 50 mM Na2HPO4.
The affinity purification procedure is repeated once more,, using the same diluted primary antibody and nitrocellulose pieces. The eluted antibodies from both rounds of purification are pooled (2.0 ml total) and 0.05 ml of a 5% BSA solution is added as carrier. A centricon ultrafiltration device (Amicon Corp., Danvers, MA) is used to change the buffer to PBS and to reduce the volume of the antibody solution to 0.1 ml. The final 0.l-ml aliquot was used directly to stain ,,o100embryos in a single well of a 96-well microtiter dish. The yield of antibody is dependent upon how strongly it reacts with a band on Western blots. We obtained enough of the $5-47 antibody

Results
Microtubule-Affinity Columns
We have constructed microtubule-affinity columns using methods modeled on those used to construct actin filament affinity columns (Miller and Alberts, 1989). The columns are constructed by covalently linking microtubules to an inert agarose support matrix, using tubulin purified from bovine brain (Mitchinson and Kirsehner, 1984) or from early Dro-
sophila embryos (Table I). Fig. 1 shows the result of poly-
acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified tubulins used for column construction. The more slowly migrating second
band seen in the purified Drosophilatubulin is a variant form
of the ot-tubulin subunit, as revealed by Western blotting (Fig. 1 B). This band may correspond to the highly divergent t~-4 tubu!in identified by Theurkauf et al. (1986).
Microtubules are highly labile structures, and they must be stabilized to survive the conditions required for an affinity chromatography experiment (for example, low temperatures and high salt concentrations). Taxol, a low molecular mass plant toxin, binds tightly to microtubules and confers suitable stability (Horwitz et al., 1982). We routinely construct microtubule-affinity columns with bed volumes ranging from 2 to 20 ml that contain approximately 1 mg/ml of bound microtubules (see Materials and Methods). The columns can be reused at least five times over a 1-mo period without detectable changes in their properties. A control column is constructed by coupling BSA to the same agarose matrix.
Affinity Purification of MAPsfrom the Early Drosophila Embryo
A cytoplasmic extract is made from early Drosophila em-
bryos under conditions that solubilize >90% of the endogenous tubulin, making it likely that most of the proteins bound to microtubules (MAPs) are solubilized by the extraction procedure. The affinity columns are loaded with the clarified extract, washed extensively with buffer, and then eluted in three steps with CX buffer containing 1.0 mM MgATP, 0.1 M KC1, and 0.5 M KCI, respectively. Fig. 2 is an elution profile comparing the protein obtained from a bovine microtubuleaffinity column and an albumin control column. Whereas 1.2% of the total extract protein binds to the microtubule

the resolvedDrosophilatubulin bands to nitrocellulose and probing
with antibodies against either alpha or beta tubulin (B). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody was used to visualize antibody staining. We did not use a high pH running buffer to resolve the alpha and beta subunits of tubulin (Gard and Kirschner, 1985) because these conditions gave poor resolution of the slow-
migrating Drosophilaot-tubulin band.

column, <13.1%binds to the control column, indicating that specific interactions with microtubules are observed.
To examine the proteins that elute from each of the columns, the column fractions were concentrated by TCA precipitation. The proteins were then separated by electrophoresis through an SDS-containing polyacrylamidc gel and visualized by Coornassie blue staining (Fig. 3). A large number of different proteins bind specifically to Drosophila and bovine microtubule affinity columns, whereas very little binding is observed to an albumin control column. Moreover, the eluates are not contaminated with any of the major proteins in the extract applied to the columns. Greater than 90% of the total protein that elutes from the microtubule affinity columns, including all of the major species, will rebind to the columns after dialysis back into a low salt buffer, suggesting that the majority of these proteins bind directly to microtubules or are components of tightly associated multiprotein complexes that bind to microtubules (data not shown). Because the proteins eluting from the columns constructed with bovine and Drosophila microtubules are largely identical, it appears that most of the binding sites for MAPs on tubulin are conserved between these two species.
For comparison, we have also isolated MAPs from Drosophila embryo extracts by a procedure based on cosedimentation of MAPs with taxol-stabilized microtubules (VaUee and Collins, 1986). In this procedure, taxol is added to a concentrated cytoplasmic extract to polymerize the endogenous tubulin. Microtubules and their associated proteins are then collected in a pellet by centrifugation. After washing this pellet, MAPs are dissociated from the microtubules with a buffer containing 0.5 M KCI and 1.0 mM MgATP. Since the microtubule protein pellet forms clumps that are difficult to homogenize except in the presence of high salt, we were unable to elute MAPs from it with MgATP alone or with 0.1 M KCI to mimic more closely the microtubule affinity column elutions.
The proteins obtained when the cosedimentation procedure is used to isolate MAPs from a Drosophila embryo extract are analyzed by PAGE in Fig. 4. Comparison of these proteins (lane B) with the total proteins that are retained on a microtubule affinity column (lane D) reveals that a greater number of different MAPs are isolated by the affinity chromatography procedure. Moreover, the proteins isolated by the cosedimentation procedure constitute only 0.5 % of the total extract protein, compared with 1.3 % of the total protein isolated by affinity chromatography. It is possible that the yield of MAPs obtained by the cosedimentation procedure could be improved by the addition of more tubulin to the extract.
The published cosedimentation procedures for isolating MAPs use a pH 6.8 Pipes buffer. When affinity chromatography experiments are carried out in this buffer, significant amounts of tubulin are lost from the columns in the presence of high salt (data not shown). Our affinity chromatography experiments are therefore carded out at pH 7.6 in Hepes buffer (see Materials and Methods). When the cosedimentation experiment is repeated in the same buffers used for the chromatography experiments, the results more closely resemble those obtained by affinity chromatography. In both cases, the MAPs obtained constitute '~1.2% of the total extract protein, and the pattern of proteins obtained by each procedure is more similar (compare lanes C and D in Fig.

The columns were loaded with a Drosophila embryo extract and eluted with ATE 0.1 M KCI, and 0.5 M KCI, as in Fig. 2. The proteins in each fraction were resolved by elcctrophorcsis through a 7--10%polyacrylamide gradient gel, and visualized by Coomassie blue staining.

4). Although most of the major MAPs are enriched by both procedures, there are large differences in the relative amounts of various proteins, and many of the minor bands are different. Each procedure has advantages: although the cosedimentation procedure is more rapid and convenient, affinity chromatography allows better control of the elution conditions.

those associated with microtubules in vivo can be identified. Moreover, MAPs with particularly interesting localizations can be identified and selected for further study, using the antibodies as probes to aid in their further purifieation and characterization.
In several studies, it has been found that mice will generate an immune response against only the few most abundant and/or immunogenic of the proteins in a complex mixture, limiting the range of the monoclonal antibodies that can be prepared with impure antigens (Miller, K., D. R. Kellogg, and B. M. Alberts, unpublished results; Burke et al., 1982). We have therefore purified our MAPs to homogeneity by preparative PAGE, so as to be able to use each purified protein as an antigen. Mice will generate remarkably specific polyclonal antisera when immunized with a single protein (see below). Hence, the sera may be used directly for immunofluorescence and Western blotting. In addition, because mice can be immunized and bled with relative ease, large numbers of sera can be rapidly screened for the presence of antibodies that give particularly interesting immunofluorescence patterns.
Fig. 5 shows portions of the preparative gradient gels that we used to resolve the proteins that elute from microtubule aitinity columns with ATE with 0.1 M KCI, and with 0.5 M KC1. There are ,x,40 protein bands of molecular mass >25,000 that can be resolved in the ATP elution, and ,x,70 protein bands in each of the 0.1 M KC1 and 0.5 M KC1 elutions. Each of these proteins is assigned an identification code according to its elution behavior and relative molecular mass. For example, the protein designated ATP-1 is the protein of greatest apparent molecular mass that elutes from

microtubule affinity columns, we have generated a library of mouse polyclonal antibodies that recognize a large number of them. By means of such antibodies, the proteins obtained in our chromatography procedure can be localized in Drosophila embryos by immunofluorescent staining, so that

microtubule affinity columns with ATE and the protein designated $5-1 is the largest protein that elutes with 0.5 M salt. Thus far we have immunized mice with eight of the ATP-eluting proteins, 24 of the 0.1 M KCl-eluting proteins, and 18 of the 0.5 M KCl-eluting proteins (see examples marked on Fig. 5). As a control, five mice were subjected to the same immunizationprotocol with polyacrylamidecontaining no protein.
Sera derived from these 50 immunized mice have been screened for the presence of specific antibodies by both Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Preimmune sera from 10 mice showed no response when tested by immunoffuorescence. In addition, sera from the five mice subjected to a control immunization protocol showed no response when tested by Western blotting. Although several of these control sera produced a weak centrosomal staining when tested by immunofluorescence on whole fixed embryos, this staining persisted only for 2-3 wk after the final immunization. The experimental mice were therefore scored as reacting positively to an injected protein only if the serum from the mouse maintained a prolonged (>6-wk) titer of an antibody that produced a distinct immunoffuorescencestaining pattern and/or identified an affinity-purified protein by Western blotting. By these criteria, 24 of the 50 mice injected with a protein band generated an immune response against the injected protein (19 of which were positive by Western blotting). Several mice generated an immune response to proteins that were barely detectable by Coomassie blue staining. We estimate that in these cases we immunized the mice with a total of only 10-25 t~g of protein.
Western blotting data for some of the antibodies are shown in Fig. 6. Serum from each mouse was diluted 1:400 and then tested against both microtubule affinity column fractions (Fig. 6 A) and against the crude extract that was loaded onto the affinity columns (Fig. 6 B). Some of the antibodies recognize more than one protein band; this could be because
several proteins share the same epitope; more likely, however, it is attributable to proteolysis. We have therefore used arrow heads in Fig. 6 to indicate the band that is of the same molecular mass as the protein band originally injected into the mouse as antigen. In those few cases where only protein bands of different molecular mass than the injected band are detected, we assume that our initial immunization was carried out with a minor proteolytic fragment or that the antibody recognizes an epitope shared by more than one protein. In addition, some of the antibodies that work well for immunofluorescence react only weakly with a protein band on Western blots. This required us to allow the color development reaction to proceed for longer than usual, resulting in a substantial background. The background protein bands are those that are found across all of the lanes in each group (see legend to Fig. 6).
The weak signal observed for some antibodies is not because of a low antibody concentration, since the same signal is obtained over a wide range of dilutions, and the antibodies work well for immunoffuorescence. We suspect that in some cases the signal is weak because of poor transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose. This may also explain why some of the antibodies that work well for immunoffuorescence do not identify proteins by Western blotting. Antibodies that gave no reaction on Western blots are not shown in Fig. 6; 5 of the 24 antibodies in our library are in this category.

The Western blotting results in Fig. 6 demonstrate that the majority of the sera recognize proteins that are greatly enriched in the microtubule affinity column fractions, as compared to the starting extract (compare A with B). These blots also demonstrate the specificity of mouse polyclonal antibodies, since there is little or no background staining of bands in the extract. The specificity of these antibodies makes them suitable for immunofluorescence localization of
their cognate proteins in fixed preparations of Drosophila
embryos.
The Subcellular Distribution of MAPs in the Early Drosophila Embryo
We have used immunofluorescent staining of whole Dro-
sophila embryos to study the subcellular distribution of the
proteins recognized by the 24 antibodies just described. As examples of the results obtained, photomicrographs showing the immunofluorescentlocalization of the MAPs recognized by three of these antibodies are presented in Fig. 7, 8, and 9. These micrographs display a small area of the surface of an embryo at nuclear cycle 10, the first cycle after the nuclei reach the embryo cortex. In addition to the antibody staining, the DNA has been stained with a second fluorochrome to reveal the location of the nuclei and their stage in the nuclear
cycle. The distribution of microtubules in the early Drosoph-
ila embryo has been discussed in other studies (Karr and AIbelts, 1986; Warn and Warn, 1986; Kellogg et al., 1988).
The S1-4 antibody most strongly recognizes a 190-kD protein that elutes from microtubules with 0.1 M KCI. R stains each centrosome as a bright dot throughout the nuclear cycle. Examples of the staining at metaphase (Fig. 7 A) and telophase (Fig. 7 B) are shown. The staining is brightest during anaphase and telophase, and is weakest during interphase.
The $5-39 antibody recognizes a 59-kD protein that elutes from microtubules with 0.5 M KC1. It stains a diffuse and irregular region around each centrosome at prophase (not shown). This staining persists through mitosis, but, in addition, a punctate staining appears at the metaphase plate that suggests kinetochore staining (Fig. 8 A). The staining at anaphase confirms the kinetochore localization. At this stage, one can see localization to the centrosomal region, as well as clear localization to the kinetochore region of the separating chromosomes (Fig. 8 C). There is little or no staining at interphase.
Finally, the distribution of the $1-8 protein (a 175-kD protein that elutes from microtubules with 0.1 M KCI) is illustrated at prometaphase, metaphase, and telophase in Fig. 9. At prometaphase, the antibody appears to stain a series of small dots that are either on the nuclear envelope or the outer edge of the nucleus (Fig. 9 A). The antibody also stains the centrosome at prometaphase, but this is not visible in the focal plane shown in Fig. 9 A. The antibody continues to stain the centrosome at metaphase, but in addition shows a diffuse localization around the spindle (Fig. 9 C). At telophase, the
antibody stains both the centrosomal region (arrows,Fig. 9
E) and a region in the middle of the interzonal microtubules
(arrowhead). During interphase there is little or no visible
staining. Similar data have been obtained for all of the antibodies
in our library. The results are summarized in Table II, which lists the molecular mass and relative abundance of the pro-

Figure 6. Analysis by Western blotting of the antibodies raised against affinity purified MAPs. Procedures are discussed in Materials and
Methods. Each antibody has been blotted against both the appropriate affinity column fractions (A) and against the crude extract (B). The blots that compare the affinity column fractions versus the crude extract were allowed to develop in the alkaline phosphatase substrate solution for equal amounts of time, so that the intensities of bands could be compared directly. We tested a total of 23 different mouse sera by Western blotting against the 0.1 m KCI-eluting proteins. All of these sera stained the group of bands in the 210-230 kD region (0.1 M KCI elution), even though 13 of the sera showed no reactivity by immunofluorescence and no specific reactivity by Western blotting. We conclude that these high molecular mass bands represent background staining, a conclusion supported by their failure to affinity purify any centrosome-staining antibodies from several antisera tested (see Materials and Methods). Since Fig. 6 represents a composite of several Western blots, the molecular masses indicated to the left of each set of lanes are approximate (within 10 kD); the exact molecular masses of the protein bands recognized by each of the antibodies are indicated in Table II. An arrowhead is used to indicate the band that is of the same molecular mass as the protein band originally injected into the mouse as antigen. Antibodies that gave no specific reaction on Western blots are not shown. See text for further discussion.

teins used as antigens, presents the results of Western blotring, and summarizes the immunofluorescence results. By immunofluorescence, 20 of the 24 antibodies that we have produced localize to microtubule structures in the early embryo. In addition, two of the remaining four antibodies appear to be localized exclusively to the neuronal system later in development, suggesting that they recognize MAPs confined to neuronal microtubules. In a similar study, Miller et al. (1989) immunized more than 40 mice with affinity-purified acrin-binding proteins from the early Drosophila embryo. The sera from 26 of these mice were tested by immunofluorescence staining of embryos fixed according to the procedures used in this study, and none of the sera were found to stain microtubule structures. These observations demonstrate that the presence of serum antibodies that stain microtubule structures is dependent upon immunization with affinity purified MAPs, and they provide an additional control for the specificity of the antibodies described in this study. Our results suggest that nearly all of the proteins that

bind to our microtubule affinity columns are genuinely associated with microtubules in vivo.
Four of the antibodies recognize proteins that localize exclusively to the centrosome (S1-4, $1-20, S1-24, and $5-45), and seven of the antibodies recognize proteins that localize primarily to the centrosome (ATP-2, ATP-5, $1-1, $1-6, S125, $1-28, and $5-47) (see Fig. 7 and Table II). To prove that these are antibodies specific for MAPs enriched by microtubule affinity chromatography, we have used individual MAPs immobilized as SDS polyacrylamide gel bands transferred to nitrocellulose to affinity purify several of the centrosomal antibodies. The affinity-purified antibodies were then used for immunofluorescent staining of fixed embryos. For each of three antibodies tested (S1-4, SI-24, and $5-47), the affinitypurified antibody stained the centrosome in a pattern identical to the unfractionated sera. An example of the staining obtained with affinity-purified $5-47 antibody is shown in Fig. 10. These results confirm that the antibodies recognize centrosomal proteins that are enriched by microtubule affinity

chromatography. Some of these proteins are likely to be functional components of the centrosome, whereas others may represent proteins that are translocated towards the minus ends of microtubules, thereby becoming localized to the centrosomal region.
There is a remarkable diversity in the subeellular distribution of the microtubule-associated proteins. Only a few of the 20 antibodies that stain early embryos recognize proteins with an identical intracellular location at all stages of the cell cycle, and only one has a distribution that closely mimics the distribution of tubulin. This is an unexpected resuR, inasmuch as the best characterized mammalian MAPs (relatively

abundant proteins initially isolated from brain) appear to be distributed along the length of most or all microtubules in cells (Vallee and Bloom, 1983; Bloom et al., 1984; Huber and Matus, 1984; Binder et al., 1985). The complexity of the microtubule cytoskeleton revealed here implies that we have a great deal yet to learn about these important filaments.
Discussion
We have used microtubule affinity chromatography to isolate a large number of MAPs from the early Drosophila embryo. This method supplements the more conventional MAP puri-

fication procedure in which proteins are bound to microtubules in solution, cosedimented with the microtubules, and then released from them with ATP and/or KCI (Vallee and Collins, 1986). Our column procedure has the advantage that low affinity interactions can be detected (Herrick and A1berts, 1972), and proteins that are present in small amounts can be greatly enriched by passage of a large amount of protein solution through the affinity column. Microtubule affinity columns can be reused multiple times, and they also provide a powerful purification step when a MAP has already been partially purified by conventional procedures. As expected, the proteins isolated by microtubule affinity chromatography and the proteins that cosediment with taxolstabilized microtubules are similar, although there are some reproducible differences (Fig. 4). Accordingly, the optimal procedure to use should be determined empirically for each MAP. It is likely that microtubule affinity columns will be best for the isolation of MAPs having a weak affinity for microtubules, whereas MAPs that have a relatively strong affinity for microtubules will be more conveniently isolated by the cosedimentation procedure.
We have generated a library of mouse polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognize 24 of the affinity-purified MAPs, and we have used immunofluorescence staining of
fixed Drosophila embryos to study the subcellular localiza-
tion of the proteins recognized by each antibody. Because at least 20 of the 24 antibodies recognize proteins that are localized to microtubule-related structures in fixed embryos, the majority of the proteins that bind to microtubule affinity columns appear to be genuinely associated with microtubules in vivo. Extrapolation to the remaining proteins isolated on these columns allows us to estimate the number of
different MAPs in the early Drosophila embryo. Approxi-
mately 180 different proteins bands can be detected by Coomassie blue staining when affinity-purified MAPs are resolved on SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels. However,

there appears to be some overlap in the proteins found in different elutions, and some bands clearly represent proteolytic breakdown products or differentlymodified forms of the same protein (see Fig. 6). Even when these factors are accounted for, one is forced to conclude that there are at least
50-100 different MAPs in the early Drosophila embryo. This
may even be an underestimate, since MAPs that are not solubilized by our extraction procedure would not be detected. Also, we have generally carried out our affinity chromatography experiments under conditions where microtubules become nearly saturated With bound MAPs. This should lead to a competition between proteins that bind to related sites on the microtubule lattice, which would favor the binding of proteins with a relatively high affinityfor microtubules. Proteins that bind to microtubules with a lower affinity could be isolated by running the microtubule-affinity columns under subsaturating conditions, or by running extracts over two affinity columns, using the first column to remove the high affinity binding proteins. (Proteins with a Kd as high as 10-5 M should be retarded by 1 column vol; see Herrick and Alberts, 1976.)
There is a striking diversity in the subcellular localization of these MAPs. Some are localized to the centrosome, while others localize to the spindle, kinetochores, interzonal microtubules, or combinations of these structures (Table II). These localizations can change dramatically through the nuclear cycle. The S1-8 antibody, for instance, stains the spindle at metaphase, while at telophase it stains only the centrosomes and a narrow region in the middle of the interzonal microtubules. The $5-47 antibody stains the centrosome very brightly during anaphase and telophase, but its antigen is barely detectable during interphase. Understanding the functional significanceof these diverse localizations and how they are generated is likely to be important for understanding the structure and function of microtubule networks.
The proteins that localize to the centrosome are particu-

larly interesting to us, since they represent the firstbiochemically defined MAPs that localize uniquely to this important microtubnle organizing center (for reviews, see Karsenti and Maro, 1986; Vorobjev and Nadezhdina, 1987). Previously, the centrosome has been characterized only by functional or morphological criteria (Mitchison and Kirsclmer, 1984; Vorobjev and Chentsov, 1982; Rieder and Borisy, 1982), or by its staining with monoclonal and autoimmune antibodies (Calarco-Gillam et al., 1983; Moroi et al., 1983; GostiTestuet al., 1986; Whiltieid et al., 1988). Comb'mingmicrotubule-affinity c h r o n m ~ with polyclonal antibody production would seem to open a new approach to studying the structureand function of the centrosome. Our antibodies that r ~ i T e centmsomal proteins should allow us to identify the corresponding genes from eDNA clone libraries in expression vectors, revealing the sequence of the protein and allowing conventional genetic approaches to centrosomal
function in Drosophila. Moreover, the proteins produced by
the cloned genes can be used to generate large amounts of
polyclonal sera, which can be injected into early Drosophila
embryos in an attempt to disrupt the function of the corresponding proteins in vivo. This kind of approach has been used successfully in other systems (Mabuchi and Okunono, 1977; Warn et al., 1987). It is especially promising in the
case of the early Drosophilaembryo, where the behavior of
the highly dynamic microtnhule networks can be observed in real time after injection of fluorescently labeled tubulin into the living cell (Kellogg et al., 1988). In addition, since
large quantifies of Drosophilaembryos are readily available,
the identified centrosomal components can be purified in sufficient quantities for their structures and activities to be characterized in vitro. Finally, a special opportunity to study centrosome multiplication and behavior independent of nuclear division is provided by injection of the DNA synthesis inhibitor aphidicolin into these embryos (Raft and Glover, 1988).

Objective : The clinico-radiologic features of the spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage (BGH) may often differ one from another, according to its regional location. Therefore, we attempted to classify the BGH into regional subgroups, and to extrapolate the distinct characteristics of each group of BGH.
Materials and Methods : A total of 103 BGHs were analyzed by retrospective review of medical records. BGH was classified according to four subgroups; anterior BGH; posterior BGH; lateral BGH; massive BGH.
Results : The most common BGH was the posterior BGH (56, 54.4%), followed by the lateral BGH (26, 25.2%), the massive BGH (12, 11.7%), and the anterior BGH (9, 8.7%). The shape of hemorrhage tended to be round in anterior, irregular in posterior, and ovoid in lateral BGH. A layered density of hematoma on initial computed tomography showed correlation with hematoma expansion (p = 0.016), which was observed more often in the postero-lateral group of BGH than in the anterior BGH group. Relatively better recovery from the initial insult was observed in the lateral BGH group than in the other regional BGH groups. The proportion of poor outcome (modified Rankin scale 4, 5, 6) was 100% in the massive, 41.1% in the posterior, 34.6% in the lateral, and 0% in the anterior BGH group.
Conclusion : We observed that BGH can be grouped according to its regional location and each group may have distinct characteristics. Thus, a more sophisticated clinical strategy tailored to each group of BGHs can be implemented.

INTRODUCTION
Spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage (BGH) is the most common hemorrhagic stroke, imposing significant socio-economic burden on the victims.18) Anatomically, the basal ganglia generally refer to a set of subcortical nuclei, such as striatum, composed of the caudate nucleus and putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus. The ventricles and internal

capsule are adjacent to the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are supplied by various deep perforators.7)11) Functionally, the basal ganglia play a crucial role in neurologic pathways, including motor, sensory, and cognition.14) Therefore, BGH may often present with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, radiologic features, and outcomes according to its regional location.
In this study, we attempted to classify BGHs into regional subgroups according to anatomic location, and

to extrapolate the distinct characteristics of each group of BGH, which may affect clinical presentation, course, and prognosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 247 patients diagnosed with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage from January 2008 to December 2012 at the author's institution were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with an underlying cause such as trauma, vascular disease, tumor, etc. were excluded from this study. As a result, 103 patients met the criteria of the spontaneous BGH group. Patients' data were collected by review of medical records and imaging studies. Functional status was assessed by modified Rankin scale (mRS) at the time of admission, discharge and six months after discharge, and was categorized according to good (0-3) or poor (4-6) group. Motor weakness was estimated according to manual muscle strength scale and the worst affected site was recorded. Motor weakness was dichotomized according to good (4-5) or poor (0-3).
BGHs were classified into four subgroups according to anatomical region based on computed tomography (CT) scans; the anterior BGH mainly involves the caudate head, and possibly extends to the anterior limb of the internal capsule and the rostral part of the putamen; the posterior BGH refers to hemorrhage mainly involving putamen, globus pallidus, and posterior limb of the internal capsule; the lateral BGH is located

below the insular cortex and outside the putamen; the massive BGH occupies all three other regions.
Hematoma volume was measured using the ABC/2 method on non-contrast brain CT scan.10) Hematoma expansion was defined as a minimum volume increment of 30% documented on follow-up CT scan within 48 hours compared to initial CT scan.9)
Chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for analysis of data. Risk factors contributing to poor outcome (mRS 4-6 at six months) were determined by single and multiple logistic regression analysis. IBM SPSS Statistics software version 20.0.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, United States) was used for all statistical analyses. Multiple comparisons were performed using pairwise Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni correction. p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Correlation between double layer on initial CT and hematoma expansion was calculated using Pearson's correlation equation.
RESULTS
No significant differences with regard to age, sex, hematoma expansion, anti-platelet medication and history of diabetes, hypertension, smoking and alcohol consumption were observed between the four subgroups. Patients' demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1.
The largest mean amount of hematoma was observed in massive type, and the smallest volume was

observed in anterior type (p = 0.005), while posterior and lateral BGHs were similarly intermediate in amount. Initial GCS score was the highest in anterior type, followed by posterior, lateral, and lowest in massive type.
Layered density on initial CT was noted in 45 BGHs, of which 13 BGHs (28.9%) had expanded on short-term interval follow-up CT. On the correlation test, double layer showed strong correlation with further hematoma expansion (p = 0.016, coefficient = 0.237).
On follow up check the best functional outcome was observed in anterior type (mean mRS = 0.67), followed by lateral (mean mRS = 2.3), posterior (mean mRS = 2.7), and worst in massive BGHs (mean mRS = 4.83). In agreement with these results, the mean delta mRS ( mRS = admission mean mRS - six-month mean mRS) showed the highest recovery potentials in anterior BGHs ( mRS = 2.33), followed by lateral ( mRS = 1.61), posterior ( mRS = 0.94), and the least in massive BGHs ( mRS = 0.09). Among borderline

amount of BGH groups of lateral and posterior type, the mean mRS of posterior type was initially better than that of lateral type at the time of admission (3.64 vs. 3.92, respectively), but these results were reversed at six months after discharge (2.31 vs. 2.7, respectively) (Fig. 5).
In single logistic regression analysis, age, amount of hematoma, IVH, initial GCS, and massive type BGH were considered possible risk factors for poor outcome (mRS 4-6 at six months), while, after multiple logistic regression analysis, only age and initial GCS remained statistically significant risk factors (Table 3).
Anterior type The anterior type was uncommon (9/103, 8.7%).
This type mainly involves the caudate head and possibly extends to the anterior limb of the internal capsule and rostral part of the putamen (Fig. 1A). Hematoma was generally round in shape and the smallest mean volume was observed among subgroups of BGH, measured as 9.7 ± 8.6 mL. Hematoma

expansion was not observed. Three patients (33.3%) had accompanying intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), however, development of hydrocephalus did not occur in any case (Fig. 1B). None of the patients was assessed as below 8 points on the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and eight patients (88.9%) were over GCS 13 on initial presentation. Two patients presented with poor motor weakness at admission, but all had recovered at discharge (Table 2). Only one patient underwent navigator assisted intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) catheter insertion. There were no deaths.
Posterior type The posterior type was most common (56/103, 54.4%)
and mainly involved putamen, globus pallidus, and posterior limb of the internal capsule (Fig. 2). Hematoma tended to be irregular in shape and the mean volume was 26.3 ± 19.9 mL. Three patients had IVH but no progressive hydrocephalus. Hematoma expansion was observed in eight patients (14.3%). Thirty one patients (55.4%) underwent navigator assisted ICH catheter insertion and one patient underwent craniotomy and hematoma removal. Poor motor grade was demon-

strated in 45 patients (80.4%) at admission, 41 patients (73.2%) at discharge, and 35 patients (62.5%) at six months after discharge (Table 2). One patient died due to hepatic encephalopathy within six months after discharge.
Lateral type The second most common BGH was lateral type
(26/103, 25.2%). The lateral BGH is located below the insular cortex and outside the putamen (Fig. 3A). Hematoma was generally ovoid in shape and the mean volume was 27.7 ± 18.3 mL (Fig. 3B). Hematoma expansion was observed in seven patients (26.9%), most commonly among the four subgroups. Four patients had IVH, but no further development of hydrocephalus was observed in any case. Most patients (17, 65.4%) showed a relatively good level of consciousness as over 13 GCS, and only one patient scored below 8 on GCS. Twenty patients (76.9%) had poor limb motor grade at the time of admission, which remained in 14 patients (53.8%) at follow-up check (Table 2). Eighteen patients (69.2%) underwent navigator assisted ICH catheter insertion and subsequent

Massive type Twelve patients (12/103, 11.7%) were massive type.
This type occupied all three other regions (Fig. 4). Hematoma was generally irregular in shape and the largest mean volume was 115.8 ± 38.4 mL. Hematoma expansion was observed in two patients (41.7%). Accompanying IVH was observed in all cases and de-

velopment of acute hydrocephalus was observed in two patients. The GCS of nine patients (75%) was below 8 points. All patients in this type presented with poor motor grade, which did not recovered until six months after discharge. Ten patients underwent surgical treatment; craniotomy and hematoma removal in four patients and navigator assisted ICH catheter insertion followed by fibrinolytic treatment in six patients (Table 2). Mortality rate was 33.3%. Two pa-

tients who did not receive surgical treatment expired before discharge.
DISCUSSION
BGHs differ variously in size, shape, and location, which may affect clinic-radiologic manifestations. We assumed that BGH could show some standardized pattern because the consistency of each nucleus of striatum, capsular fibers, and peri-ventricular matter is differently discrete, and, as a resultant, may act as a boundary of the hemorrhagic cavity. In the previous report by Chung et al.,4) BGHs were categorized according to six types based on vascular territory, including anterior, middle, posteromedial, posterolateral, lateral, and massive type. Each type presented with its own unique location, morphological characteristics, and clinical presentations and outcomes, similar to ours. However, in clinical application, it often seemed confusing and slightly cumbersome to differentiate one type of BGH from another type, particularly between middle, posteromedial, and posterolateral type. Therefore, we tried to categorize BGHs more simply into four subgroups mainly based on

anatomical structures and could assure that this modified subgroup of BGH still reflect well enough their clinico-radiological characteristics.
The amount of hemorrhagic volume is the critical factor related to initial neurologic status and subsequent long term prognosis.5)8)15)16) Therefore, it was notable that the volume of hematoma showed a distinct trend according to its location. The largest mean amount of hematoma was observed in massive type, as intuitively expected, and anterior type showed the smallest volume. In addition, initial GCS score was the highest in anterior type, meaning that most patients with anterior BGHs are less neurologically stunned. In general, initial GCS score was slightly higher in posterior type than in lateral type, but posterior type showed a broad spectrum in GCS. Because the lateral and posterior type tended to show a moderate amount of hemorrhage (20~30mL), more sophisticated decision making regarding surgical intervention may be mandatory. According to our observation, the potentials for recovery from motor weakness were better in lateral type than in posterior type. In lateral type, motor weakness showed rapid recovery during hospitalization before discharge,

however, in the posterior type, recovery of motor grade was gradual during long term rehabilitation after discharge. It appeared that the posterior type damaged basal ganglia and adjacent structures directly, but lateral BGH did not directly affect the neural tracts, but simply compressed them. For this reason, patients in lateral type BGH may require early surgical intervention for rescue of a salvageable neural tract. The well circumscribed, ovoid shape of lateral BGH is also best fit to stereotactic catheter aspiration and subsequent fibrinolytic treatment, whereas posterior BGHs are often shaped in an irregular staghorn. Steady and continuous rehabilitation could be emphasized more in patients with posterior BGH.
Previous reports have advocated that larger ICHs were significantly more irregular in shape, heterogeneous in density, and had greater growth, and density heterogeneity independently predicted ICH growth.1)9) In this study, a layered density of hematoma on initial CT scan showed correlation with hematoma expansion, as in a previous study. A layered density of hematoma on initial computed tomography was seen mainly in massive type. However, hema-

toma expansion among BGHs showing layered density was most frequently identified in the lateral type of BGH. This may be because emergent surgical intervention was more readily adopted in posterior and massive BGHs so that the time interval between initial and follow-up CT was too short to recognize identifiable hematoma expansion. Actually, hematoma expansion was observed in two patients who did not undergo surgical treatment. At least, we could assure that the layered density within the hematoma cavity is a strong predictor of hematoma growth.
IVH was seen mainly in massive type, followed by anterior type. Because the medial side of the caudate nucleus is composed of the lateral wall of the frontal horn of the ventricle, anterior BGHs can spread into the ventricle more frequently than posterior and lateral BGHs do. Many reports advocate that the combined IVH is a negative factor for good recovery,6)8)11) however, the existence of IVH appeared not to affect the final outcome if combined with anterior BGH. On the contrary, if IVH is combined with another type of BGH, it may implicate the explosive nature of hemorrhage, resulting in a relatively poor clinical course.
Regarding functional outcome on follow up check, the highest recovery potentials were observed in anterior BGHs, followed by lateral, posterior, and massive BGHs were most ominous. Among borderline amount of BGH groups of lateral and posterior type, it was interesting that the mean mRS of posterior type was initially better than the lateral type at the time of admission, but these results were reversed at six months after discharge. As previously described regarding recovery potentials in motor weakness, the initial insult by the larger volume of hematoma might reflect slightly poorer neurological status in lateral BGHs, however, simply stunned neurophysiological function in lateral BGHs could better retain their ability soon after alleviation of mechanical and chemical stresses than destructed neural pathway in posterior BGHs could do. The corticospinal tract, a major neural tract in the human brain for motor function, runs along the

Fig. 5. The mean modified Rankin scale scores (mRS) of each group of basal ganglia hemorrhage (BGH) at the time of admission, discharge, and six months after discharge are shown. The mean mRS at the time of admission was the best in anterior BGH (= 3.0), followed by posterior (= 3.64), lateral (= 3.92), and the worst in massive BGH (= 4.92). At discharge, the mean mRS was 1.56 in anterior BGH, 3.27 in posterior, 3.38 in lateral, and 5.17 in massive BGH. At six-month follow up, the mean mRS was the best in anterior BGH (= 0.67), followed by lateral (= 2.31), posterior (= 2.7), and the worst in massive BGH (= 4.83). The mean delta mRS ( mRS = admission mean mRS six-month mean mRS) revealed the highest recovery potentials in anterior BGHs (= 2.33), followed by lateral (= 1.61), posterior (= 0.94), and the least in massive BGHs (= 0.09).
posterior limb of the internal capsule. Therefore, this neural pathway may be more preserved in anterior and lateral type BGH than posterior type BGH, which can affect functional outcome. As shown in Fig. 5, the mean mRS of lateral BGHs nearly catches up with that of the posterior BGHs at the time of discharge, and finally surpassed at six months after discharge. Among these two deep seated, medium volumes of ICH groups, the final prognosis might differ as to the primary locations of hematoma.
Except for patients in massive type, no patient died due to BGH itself. The cause of death in one patient in posterior type was hepatic encephalopathy. Two patients who did not undergo surgical treatment in massive type expired before discharge. One patient with massive type who underwent direct surgical evacuation of hematoma recovered and scored mRS 2 at six months after discharge. Although there is significant criticism regarding performance of surgical intervention in deep seated ICHs,2)3)12)13)17) we experienced and believed that a certain patient may still

possess recovery potential. Over 75% of patients with massive BGHs were unconscious, uncommunicable in devastating status, thus, selection of patients who might benefit from surgical intervention seemed difficult. Therefore, an aggressive strategy to include all possible surgical candidates can be the final opportunity for recovery for life threatening ICH victims, once providing that the surgical intervention can meet the condition of 'at least do no harm'.
This is a retrospective study, harboring possible bias in patient selection, assessment, and follow-up plan. Furthermore, we did not assess additional clinical manifestations, such as language impairment, cognitive function, and other non-motor deficits. In addition, because variables between hematoma volume, initial GCS, IVH, and type of BGH may be co-related, and the number of data in each group seems relatively small, the statistical calculation failed to show significance of regional location of BGH in assessing risk factors for poor outcome. All of these are possible limitations of this report, and subject to future investigation.
CONCLUSION
BGHs showed diverse clinico-radiological features. We observed that BGHs can be grouped according to regional location and each group may have distinct characteristics. Thus, more sophisticated clinical strategy tailored to each group of BGHs can be implemented.

Abstract
Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (commonly known as MAFLD) impacts global health in epidemic proportions, and the resulting morbidity, mortality and economic burden is enormous. While much attention has been given to metabolic syndrome and obesity as offending factors, a growing incidence of polypharmacy, especially in the elderly, has greatly increased the risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in general, and drug-induced fatty liver disease (DIFLD) in particular. This review focuses on the contribution of DIFLD to DILI in terms of epidemiology, pathophysiology, the most common drugs associated with DIFLD, and treatment strategies.

Introduction
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) represents a significant health problem in the USA and many European countries.1 In prospective and retrospective DILI studies,2 the annual incidence has been reported as 2.7 per 100,000 people. Furthermore, in many countries, DILI has been associated with acute liver failure. The risk factors for DILI include numerous interrelated factors, such as advanced age, sex, drug dose, genetic factors, concomitant drugs, excessive alcohol consumption, nutrition, pre-existing liver disease,

diabetes mellitus, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and kidney failure.3 Historically, DILI has been divided into
two types. Type 1 is dose-dependent and predictable, and
type 2 results from idiosyncratic reaction. Type 2 is mostly
dose-independent, and can be either allergic, immunemediated, or non-allergic, nonimmune-mediated.4 The di-
agnosis of DILI is determined by a temporal relationship
between drug administration and increased levels of liver enzymes and/or alkaline phosphatase,5,6 exclusion of other
causes of liver damage, and rarely repeated drug challenge. There is no standardized clinical test for this condition.5,7
Drug-induced cholestasis is induced when drugs disrupt bile
acid transport by inhibiting liver transporters involved in bile flow.6 Cholestasis can be also found in severe metabolic
dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) stages, alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic cirrhosis.8 Drug-induced
cirrhosis is associated with drugs that cause fibrogenesis and production of extracellular matrix molecules.9
MAFLD is a new concept, proposed in 2020, that has been
suggested to replace the term nonalcoholic fatty liver dis-
ease because it does not require the exclusion of alcoholic liver disease or viral hepatitis.10,11 It is a more accurate
term for people with fatty liver and those with dysmetabolism.1,2 MAFLD is well known as a highly prevalent dis-
ease affecting a quarter of the world's adult population and
is the main cause of chronic liver disease in Europe and USA.11,12 Besides, with the very high prevalence of MAFLD
and alcohol abuse worldwide, the relationship among any
present study population and real-world populations is of concern.10 The novel MAFLD criteria concentrate on the role
of dysmetabolism in fat accumulation in the liver, that is the most frequent driver of fatty liver injury progression.13,14
When fatty liver injury progresses due to preexisting MAFLD
in combination with drug administration, it is defined as a dual-etiology fatty liver disease.10 Recently, two studies
have recommended that the MAFLD criteria are more ef-
ficient and better for perceiving patients with a higher risk
of fibrosis, in contrast with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease criteria.11,15 MAFLD is diagnosed in patients when they have
the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, which is
diagnosed when three or more of the following conditions
are found: high glucose, hypertension, obesity, high triglyceride, and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol.16 There
are a growing number of clinical reports proposing that cer-
tain drugs can be more hepatotoxic in overweight patients with MAFLD, in contrast with lean patients.17
DILI in MAFLD appears in two particular clinical situations.17,18 First, antibiotics such as piperacillin-tazobactam,
telithromycin, and some analgesics and antipyretics, like

acetaminophen, can induce more serious and common acute liver injury. It appears that some drugs, like amiodarone and statins, do not induce hepatotoxicity more often in MAFLD patients.17 Other drugs like antiretroviral agents, corticosteroids, and methotrexate appear to cause the alteration of simple fatty liver to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or exacerbate necroinflammation, pre-existing steatosis, and fibrosis.19,20 Some drugs can cause more serious acute liver injury in MAFLD because this illness is connected with the various modified activities of metabolizing enzymes such as cytochromes P450. Regarding the above-mentioned information, MAFLD is frequently connected with increased CYP2E1 activity and decreased CYP3A4 activity as well as with higher glucuronide formation. These enzymes are responsible for metabolism of, e.g., lorazepam and acetaminophen. More in vitro and in vivo research is required because the mechanisms wherewith drugs and xenobiotics are more hepatotoxic in MAFLD are not well known and more studies are a necessary in ensuring success in dealing with this issue, especially considering the worldwide epidemic of obesity.21,22
Drugs represent an alternative cause of fatty liver disease and the term that corresponds to this injury is druginduced fatty liver disease (DIFLD). It is a specific form of DILI, characterized by intracellular lipid accumulation in hepatocytes with steatotic changes as the predominant histopathological pattern.23,24 Although this histopathological finding is required for the diagnosis, the finding is not specific.11 DIFLD is often accompanied by inflammation and oxidative stress, which leads to the development of druginduced steatohepatitis (DISH).25 Chronic liver injury leads to hepatocyte death, followed by the activation of stellate cells which finally results in liver tissue fibrosis. In addition, there are numerous drugs which can cause progression of steatohepatitis.26 In 2015, Satapathy et al.27 have shown that tamoxifen, an anti-estrogenic drug used in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer, was frequently associated with hepatic steatosis, although rarely with cirrhosis or steatohepatitis. Moreover, the authors emphasized that chronic exposure to amiodarone, 4, 4-diethylaminoethoxyhexestrol and perhexiline maleate rarely led to cirrhosis.27,28 It is known that phospholipidosis develops after prolonged treatment with these drugs, in a dose-dependent manner. However, it does not lead to steatohepatitis. Further investigations are needed to elucidate mechanisms by which drug-induced steatosis leads to steatohepatitis and consequently to fibrosis.
Buggey et al.29 reported that amiodarone-induced acute and chronic liver injury without steatosis leads to necrosis and bridging fibrosis with early-stage cirrhosis. It is well known that amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity has been characterized by histologic steatosis, phospholipidosis and fibrosis. However, in that case report, the histopathology showed an absence of steatosis and phospholipidosis, despite years of amiodarone ingestion. This suggests that lack of formerly accepted histopathologic findings, such as steatosis and phospholipidosis, should not exclude the diagnosis. This conclusion, however, requires further study and confirmation. Various other studies have confirmed the role of amiodarone in the induction of liver cirrhosis, with possible fatal outcomes.30-32 Nevertheless, these adverse effects were found to be rare, with an incidence of 1-3%. A long-term surveillance for liver toxicity in high-risk patients using amiodarone has been suggested by numerous researchers.30,31,33
Most drugs capable of causing steatosis and steatohepatitis are known to have cationic amphiphilic structure.34 These drugs are divided into three groups, including drugs that cause steatosis and steatohepatitis independently, such as amiodarone and perhexiline, drugs that can accelerate latent metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepati-

tis (MASH), such as tamoxifen, and drugs that may cause sporadic events of steatosis/steatohepatitis, such as carbamazepine.23 More details over the effects of these drugs on liver tissue will be discussed in the sections below.
Epidemiology of DIFLD
Recently, reported annual incidences of DILI have varied widely in population-based studies, from 2.7 to 19.1 cases per 100,000.35 Accordingly, the true incidence of DIFLD in the general population remains unknown.35 However, druginduced steatosis (DIS) or drug-induced steatohepatitis (DISH) are generally rare but well-documented forms of DILI. According to the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN), approximately 27% of DILI cases have some form of steatosis with histological injury.36 In the study of Kleiner et al.,36 only one case was diagnosed with the predominant pattern of microvesicular steatosis, while the remaining cases showed a combination of macrovesicular steatosis with inflammation. Previously published descriptions of pathologic changes in DILI were used as the basis for the diagnostic classification in DILIN in the prospective study by Kleiner et al.36,37 To define patterns of injury, standard hepatopathological diagnostic criteria were used.38 Although this included a large proportion of DIFLD in DILI cases, the DILIN prevalence may be biased by the pre-existing presence of a fatty liver. The true data on DIFLD epidemiology might become clearer after eliminating diagnostic difficulties and deficiencies in systematic reporting.
Histology of DIFLD
DIFLD can present as pure macrovesicular or microvesicular steatosis or as DISH. Histologically, in macrovesicular steatosis, the accumulation of large lipid vesicles (mostly triglycerides) occurs in the hepatocyte, with the nucleus becoming consequently dislocated to the periphery of the cell.36,39 As in other causes of steatohepatitis, aminotransferases are usually moderately increased.40 The presence of triglycerides is associated with deterioration of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (mtFAO), decreased very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, stimulation of de novo lipogenesis, direct activation of transcription factors, such as SREBP1c and PPAR, and development of insulin resistance.17,27,41-43 In microvesicular steatosis, the cytoplasm of hepatocytes is filled with numerous small lipid vesicles, and the nucleus remains in the center of the cell.44 The severe impairment of mtFAO leads to increased esterification into triglycerides, which are known to be histologically related to microvesicular steatosis.27,45 Steatohepatitis is characterized by lobular inflammation, balloon degeneration, hyaline Mallory bodies, and sometimes perisinusoidal fibrosis.23,39,46 Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in DIFLD, through the direct or indirect action of oxidative stress and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that mainly occur due to modification of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC).17,47 Microvesicular steatosis (druginduced) is frequently the result of drug-induced damage to mitochondria.48,49 This type of steatosis can start with small droplets of fat in the cytoplasm and then increase to macrovesicular steatosis characterized by large fat droplets that shifted the nucleus to the periphery. Frequently, macrovesicular steatosis can present with mixed large and small droplets.50,51 Depending on the particular pathogenic mechanism of each lipotoxic drug, DIS/DISH can present as micro- or macrovesicular steatosis/steatohepatitis, but most cases start acutely with microvesicular injury.52 The latency of DIFLD before clinical manifestations may vary.24

For DIS/DISH diagnosis, liver biopsy is the standard means for confirmation of hepatic cell injury and liver inflammation.52
Risk factors for occurrence of DIFLD
Some drugs cause progression of MAFLD to MASH or cirrhosis, and may also worsen the prognosis in patients with fatty liver.17 This conversion to MASH appears to involve genetic and environmental factors.17 MAFLD and obesity may enhance the risk of hepatotoxicity of various drugs.18 The possible mechanisms by which certain drugs are able to accelerate progression of MAFLD include induction of oxidative stress, diminished mtFAO, increased de novo lipogenesis, and damaged egress of VLDL from liver cells.53
Most often, DIFLD is a product of direct impact of drugs on the liver, mostly associated with the extended intake of medications. For example, long-term administration of drugs, such as amiodarone, perhexiline and diethylaminoethoxyhexestrol, can lead to DISH. Furthermore, patients with additional risk factors, like obesity and cardiometabolic risks, are more prone to exacerbation of steatosis or steatohepatitis when irinotecan, tamoxifen and methotrexate are added to their therapy. Insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia in combination with antiepileptic drugs and steroids can also lead to steatohepatitis, MASH or DIFLD.27 Fatty liver injury progression is related to factors such as insulin resistance, adipose tissue dysfunction, lipid aggregation, and oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Also, increased gut permeability and increased plasma endotoxin levels can be associated with fatty liver.54-56
Besides environmental risk factors, genetics also plays a significant role in the progression of simple steatosis.57 Among patients with similar risk factors, large interindividual variability in phenotypic penetrance exists.57 Various genetic, epidemiological and twin studies have shown a strong heritability of predisposition to MAFLD.57 Apart from drugs, intrinsic (sex, age, ethnicity, liver, and renal condition) and other extrinsic (environmental chemicals, alcohol, diet, and drug-drug interactions) risk factors must be considered in any clinical algorithm associated with the fatty liver.58 There is growing evidence for a genetic contribution to the development of MASH, even though environmental risk factors play a main role in the development of simple steatosis. In various (twin, epidemiological, and familial) studies, a large variability exists in phenotypic penetrance among people with related risk factors, and a powerful heritability of sensitivity to MAFLD has been noticed.57 Studies on the role of genetics in DIFLD are still in the early phases, and more studies are needed to augment understanding of genetic variants and other risk factors in the progression of DIFLD and MAFLD.
Influence of pharmacogenetics on the risk for developing DIFLD
Alterations in genes involved in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are partially responsible for variations in drug response.58 Part of an individual's predisposition for the development of side effects with high doses of certain drugs, like methotrexate or tamoxifen, can be explained by the patient's genetic makeup as well as pharmacogenetics. As mentioned before, methotrexate and tamoxifen are some of the drugs that can cause macrovesicular hepatic steatosis linked to DIFLD. In the context of high-dose methotrexate toxicity, it is important to emphasize that it is unpredictable, and interindividual variability is significant. The results from the previous studies on the pharmacogenetics of high

doses of methotrexate differ, and are sometimes contradictory. This can be partly explained by significant differences in the pharmacogenetics of various populations.39,59 Several genotypes have been associated with a higher risk of methotrexate toxicity, such as MTHFR 677TT (reduced activity of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase which leads to diminished elimination of methotrexate), RFC-1 80G>A (reduced folate carrier 1, which is responsible for methotrexate entrance into the cells), and ABCB1 C3435TT (ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1; reduced action of MDR1 and, therefore, slower elimination of methotrexate).60 The metabolisms of 5-fluorouracil depends on the enzymatic activity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. Indeed, variants *2A or *13 of this enzyme are related to reduced metabolism of 5-fluorouracil, which can lead to serious side effects.61 Genetic alterations in the patatin-like phospholipase 3 gene (PNPLA3) affect the plasma levels of hepatic enzymes and risk for MAFLD development,62,63 including predisposition for fibrosis progression.64,65 The above-mentioned polymorphism is a powerful predictor of inflammation, steatosis and fibrosis66 but the role of PNPLA3 in DIFLD pathogenesis remains obscure.27 Polymorphisms of PNPLA3 are strongly associated with ethnic and interindividual variations in liver fat content.57 Hispanics were found to have a higher tendency to develop liver steatosis, unlike AfricanAmericans.67 In addition, twin studies suggest that about 60% of alanine transaminase variability may be ascribed to genetic factors.68 Slow metabolizers for perhexiline, such as Caucasians, are at the greater danger of neuropathy and steatohepatitis. Perhexiline is catabolized by cytochrome P450 isoform 2D6 and has a long half-life due to the slow liver clearance in slow metabolizers.69
In recent years, the genetic factors of steatosis have been studied utilizing genome-wide association techniques. Further research in the area of pharmacogenomics is needed to better understand numerous possible gene polymorphisms that might be responsible for increasing risk of DIFLD development.
Drugs that cause DIFLD
Drugs shown to cause macrovesicular liver steatosis are glucocorticoids, amiodarone, methotrexate, estrogens, tamoxifen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol, 5-fluorouracil, and metoprolol.39,70-72 Drugs associated with microvesicular steatosis are valproic acid, tetracycline, aspirin, ibuprofen, zidovudine, and glucocorticoids.24,44 Drugs associated with DISH are valproic acid, tamoxifen, perhexiline, amiodarone, and propranolol.44,73 It is important to recognize the particular drugs that could cause acute liver damage on a fatty liver background or that could increase the danger of serious chronic liver disease. The hepatic accumulation of fat is not necessarily stable and DIS/DISH are reversible.74 In many cases, it is difficult to elucidate whether the fatty liver disease is a direct result of an effect on hepatic cells or a consequence of a weight gain caused by the drugs such as antidepressants or antipsychotics. Pharmaceuticals that could induce the progression or exacerbate pre-existing fatty liver to MASH and fibrosis are shown in Table 1.17
Mechanisms of DIFLD development
The main mechanisms in the development of DIFLD are thought to include lipogenesis and generation of free radicals leading to oxidative stress induction in hepatocytes.44,75 Kim et al.76 showed that amiodarone caused an increase in short, medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines in the livers of

rats, with the highest increases involving levels of acetylcar-
nitine. The most probable cause of these disturbances in liv-
er tissue is the effect of amiodarone on mtFAO by blocking
the activity of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 enzyme,
thereby directly inhibiting the mitochondrial -oxidation of
acyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and by inhibiting complexes I and II of the MRC.19,77 Another proven mechanism of amiodar-
one-induced DIFLD is triggering of de novo lipogenesis by
augmenting the expression of genes sterol regulatory ele-
ment-binding protein 1, thyroid hormone-inducible hepatic
protein, ATP-citrate synthase, fatty acid synthase, and acyl-
CoA desaturase, which are all involved in the process of lipogenesis.78 Additionally, Anthérieu et al.78 demonstrated in
vitro that amiodarone administration led to overexpression
of genes involved in formation of lipid droplets, namely per-
ilipin-4 and adipose differentiation-related protein. Tamox-
ifen, like amiodarone, is a cationic amphiphilic compound that accumulates in liver tissue, causing liver injury.34 Its
toxic effect is also achieved by impairing the mtFAO and induction of de novo lipogenesis.79 A possible mechanism for
the induction of hepatic steatosis includes the upregulation of SREBP-1c and its downstream lipogenesis target genes.24
Accumulation of triglycerides stimulates microsomal triglyc-
eride transfer protein expression associated with VLDL assembly and secretion.80 Several in vivo studies confirmed
the role of oxidative stress in tamoxifen hepatotoxicity. Like
amiodarone, it causes a reduction in liver glutathione lev-
els, accumulation of oxidized form of glutathione, and lipid peroxidation.75,81
Methotrexate and especially its polyglutamated me-
tabolite are both stored in hepatocytes and exert hepatotoxic effects.82 Several mechanisms are proposed for the
hepatotoxic effect of methotrexate, including hampering of
folate entry to mitochondria, which leads to mitochondrial
dysfunction and generation of ROS and finally induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis.54,83,84 Another possible
mechanism of hepatotoxicity is disruption of the intesti-
nal epithelial barrier by methotrexate, which then leads to
leaky gut syndrome, and the progression of fatty liver injury.34,54 5-Fluorouracil, irinotecan, and l-asparaginase, all
exert their hepatosteatotic effects by impairing mtFAO and enhancing ROS accumulation in hepatocytes.20,85 Valproate,
a branched-chain fatty acid, disrupts the mtFAO, leading to the accumulation of triglycerides and steatosis.44 Valproate
in its free acid form can serve as a substrate for mtFAO path-
ways, competing with other free fatty acids. After entering
the hepatic mitochondria, it conjugates with coenzyme A and causes a deficiency in that enzyme.44 Chronic valproate
administration increases the progression of a pre-existing
fatty liver disease by inducing systemic insulin resistance and weight gain.86,87 Tetracycline is well known for causing
DIFLD. Mechanisms for this toxic effect include inhibition
of mtFAO, inhibition of MTP enzyme (which results in ac-
cumulation of VLDL), decrease in the expression of several
genes involved in mtFAO (peroxisome proliferator-activated

receptor alpha, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, and fatty acid-binding protein 1), and enhancement of ROS generation by activation of the transcription factor ATF4 (which up-regulates CYP2E1; specifically, by doxycycline and minocycline).34,41,88,89 Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir and abacavir, are capable of inhibiting human DNA polymerase , leading to the decrease in mitochondrial DNA replication.90,91 Consequently, oxidative stress and accumulation of fat occur.90,91 All the above-mentioned mechanisms involved in DIFLD development are summarized in Table 2.
Current and future directions in the treatment of DIFLD
A fairly common recommendation for the management of DILI and potential manifestation of DIFLD is the withdrawal of the potential offending agent. Timely exclusion of the problematic drugs can lead to full recovery; up to 95% of patients show improvement but a few will still develop chronic liver disease.92 Criteria of withdrawal of the drugs causing DILI were published in 2009 by the Food and Drug Administration93 and are summarized in the following guidelines as follows: alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase are >8 upper limit of normal (ULN), >5 ULN (for the period of 2 weeks), >3 ULN combined with international normalized ratio >1.5 and total bilirubin >2 ULN or levels of alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase higher than 3, but followed with nausea, fever, fatigue, vomiting, rash, tenderness or pain (right upper abdominal quadrant) and potential eosinophilia.92 If there is no adequate replacement for the hepatotoxic drug, then the dose should be adjusted in order to manage the primary disease, especially in intrinsic DILI.92
Glucocorticoids are used sometimes to treat DILI and DIFLD, but only after a serious risk-benefit assessment. They are beneficial in patients who show notable signs of autoimmunity or hypersensitivity, even after drug withdrawal.92 Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has a hepatoprotective effect (including for cholangiocytes), stimulatory effect on hepatobiliary secretion, and prevents cellular apoptosis, as described in 15 DILI patients.94 The effectiveness of UDCA in DILI cases lies in its improvement of the liver function abnormalities and relieving symptoms such as fatigue, pruritus and jaundice,95-97 significantly improving liver tests98 and possibly delaying liver transplantation.99,100 Beneficial effects of UDCA have been shown in cohort studies and case reports after administration of the following drugs that cause liver injury, namely chlorpromazine, cyclosporine, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticlopidine, flucloxacillin, paraquat, and methotrexate.97,101-105 Rarely, individual case reports have supported the therapeutic properties of UDCA. One of those is a pediatric report of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid toxicity 4 years after the liver transplantation. Amelioration

Conclusions
DIFLD remains a great challenge for researchers and clinicians because of the lack of adequate diagnostic tools and numerous underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms involved. Therefore, many cases of DIFLD are unrecognized or confirmation of diagnosis occurs in later irreversible stages of liver disease. Elucidation of various pathways by which specific drugs cause DIFLD represents a step forward in the development of appropriate therapy. It is important to emphasize that drug withdrawal or dose adjustment are so far the best therapeutic recommendation when it comes to DILI/DIFLD cases. Nevertheless, some treatments, such as UDCA for cholestasis, have shown benefit in the early stages.98 However, the field needs more studies, especially in the use of pharmacogenetics to predict and avoid DILI, and in identifying individuals who may benefit from pharmacological interventions.

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Incivility has been raised as a growing concern and a hot topic in nursing education. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a contextbased educational intervention on the nursing students' civility index and their perception of uncivil behaviors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This quasiexperimental study was done from 2019 to 2020 in Khorramabad, Iran. A contextbased educational intervention focusing on problembased scenarios was conducted for 4 weeks. Clark Civility Index for Students and Classmates (2017) and Clark Incivility Scale in the University Environment (2014) were used. Data were analyzed using Stata, descriptive statistics, and paired ttest.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the mean score of students' civility index before and after the intervention (8.31 points increase, P = 0.004). However, there was no significant difference between the mean score of the civility index for classmates before and after the intervention. Furthermore, the mean score of students' perception of incivility after the intervention increased by 5.88 points, which confirmed the significant effect of the intervention in improving students' understanding of uncivil behaviors (P = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the effectiveness of the problembased scenario along with other strategies such as journal club and selflearning in increasing the awareness of civility and improving the civility index, the use of these strategies is recommended in order to reduce incivility.

Introduction
Incivility is not a new topic for nursing students and teachers, but it is a growing concern and a hot topic in nursing education.[1,2] Academic incivility is considered violent, disruptive, rude, and destructive behaviors as well as failure to take action in necessary circumstances.[3] Clark and Springer define uncivil behavior as obscene speech or inappropriate actions that can range from insulting and abusive

disruption in professors' interpersonal relationships with students decreases job satisfaction, and increases student absenteeism.[5,6]
The goal of healthcare professionals is to provide safe care and promotion patient safety.[7] If academic incivility remains unknown, it may develop and create temporary or permanent threatening situations and ultimately "threaten the patient safety." Nursing educators are morally obligated to ensure that students acquire basic skills in creating a healthy work environment and thus ensuring safe care.[8] In addition, with the continuation of uncivil behaviors in students, they may enter the professional workplace without enough knowledge about it and turn into immoral people.[9] Since the process of professionalization and familiarity with ethical standards begins in educational environments,[10] approaches that prevent the occurrence of such behaviors in students are of particular importance.
Based on the evidence, many quantitative and qualitative studies have been conducted in the field of incivility, which have mainly focused on identifying this problem and realizing its nature, severity, and importance.[1114] Few intervention studies have been conducted on the management of such behaviors in academic settings. In the study of Clark et al., problembased scenarios of challenging clinical environment were developed by nursing teachers and displayed online for nursing students. The results of this study showed that this intervention has been an effective way to increase students' awareness and perception of incivility and to promote its management by students.[1] Another study was conducted by woith et al. (2012) using the journal club as an effective intervention on the perception of uncivil behaviors by nursing students. The results of this study also indicated the effectiveness of the intervention. [15] Another intervention study was conducted by Kerber et al. in 2012. The findings of the study showed that the journal club increased peoples awareness of civil and uncivil behaviors, improved assistance to other students, and developed adaptation skills.[16] The results of a mixed exploratory study by Jenkins et al. in the United States revealed that the mean of adjustment behaviors increased after journal club. Students' description of civility was in the form of five themes of respect, equality, care, constructive communication, and working with each other.[17] Abedini and Parvizy conducted a quasiexperimental study in Iran. The results showed that group discussion can be used as a suitable strategy to promote academic civility.[18]
It was found that in different studies, various strategies such as problembased scenario and journal clubs have been used. The results of the study by the authors regarding students' and teachers' views on strategies

for promoting civility indicated that increasing students' awareness is the first priority in both groups. Furthermore, considering the cultural dimension of the issue, it seems that using methods appropriate to the educational context is a more sensible solution. Thus, considering the importance of the subject and the results of the previous study conducted by the authors in educational setting,[2] this study was conducted to determine the effect of a contextbased educational intervention on the students' civility index and their perception of uncivil behaviors.
Materials and Methods
This onegroup quasiexperimental study was conducted in the first semester of the 20192020 academic year in one of the universities of medical sciences in Western Iran
Out of the total number of students, 45 were studying in the second semester and chose the course of nursing ethics and professional behavior. They were selected by the whole enumeration. The inclusion criteria were as follows: willingness to participate in the study, being at least 18yearold, studying in the third semester of nursing school and passing at least one internship course in a clinical environment. If a student wanted to leave the study or missed one of the educational intervention sessions, they were excluded from the study. Before the intervention, the objectives of the study were explained to the students and the informed consent were taken from them. The research tool was completed by the students during the first session as a selfreport in 10 min. The first part of the demographic information included age, sex, marital status, residency status, and grade point average of the units they have passed. Clark Civility Index for Students and Classmates (2017) was the second tool of the study. In this tool, students are asked to report the frequency of occurrence of civil behaviors in themselves and their classmates according to the 5point Likert scale (5 = always, 4 = usually, 3 = sometimes, 2 = rarely, and 1 = never). The points of the items are added together, and according to the score obtained, the person is placed in one of the following groups in terms of civility index: 100-90 (very civil), 89-80 (civil), 79-70 (moderately civil), 69-60 (mildly civil), 59-50 (uncivil), <50 (very uncivil).[19]
The tool was translated from the original language into the target language after obtaining permission from the scale designer. After combining the translations by a panel of experts, the tool was translated back from the target language to the original language. After pretest and cognitive interview, the final version was approved by the scale designer. To examine the content validity index (CVI), the tool was provided to 10 experts (6 nursing faculty members, 2 sociologists, and 2 psychologists). They were asked to rate each item

for its relevance to the structure. The items were graded numerically from 1 to 4 based on their relevance criteria. The minimum CVI for items was 0.8 and the CVI for scale was 0.94. The reliability of the instrument was confirmed to be 0.94 with an intracluster correlation coefficient, and its Cronbach's alpha was 0.93.
The next tool was the psychoanalyzed Persian version of the incivility in nursing educationrevised of Clark et al.(2015). It includes a 24item list of uncivil behaviors related to nursing students who are asked to rate the level of uncivil behavior based on a 4point Likert scale (1 = non uncivil, 2 = somewhat uncivil, 3 = moderately uncivil, and 4 = highly uncivil). The mean is calculated separately for each item.[3] In the study of Mohammadipour et al.(2018), the CVI of all items on the scale was >0.78 and it was 0.91 for the whole scale. Using an intracluster correlation coefficient, the stability of the instrument was revealed to be 0.91 and its internal consistency was confirmed with Cronbach's alpha of 0.86.[20] Roleplaying has been considered as an active learning strategy in the field of uncivil behaviors and a strategy for selfknowledge.[21,22]
In this study, senior students used a problembased scenario focusing on a situation between several students (7 senior students) and a teacher (a postgraduate student) to demonstrate some common uncivil behaviors such as cheating, inattentive behavior in class, distracted classmates, using mobile phones, unpreparedness for the class, etc., so that all participants (junior students) could see the desired scenario. The scenario was developed based on the experiences of the role player students and under the guidance of the teacher [Box 1]. This scenario was reviewed with the help of several faculty members and senior students. Senior students practiced their roles in the presence of the teacher several times to be able to present it to junior students, and the final version of the play was prepared. After performing the role play, a debriefing session was held to discuss different perspectives and the possibility of providing feedback to students.[23] They were asked to share their views from this experience. Students were encouraged to express their feelings about the teacher and learners. Finally, the students' information was summarized by the teacher and transmitted to the students.

Then a handout about professional ethics in achademic environment was sent to the students via WhatsApp with key points of civil behaviors, uncivil behaviors, examples of uncivil behaviors, causes of uncivil behaviors, consequences and management of uncivil behaviors, factors affecting the relationship between student and teacher, factors affecting the presence of students in theoretical classes, students' duties toward teachers, students' ethics in Islam, students' duties toward teachers taken from Imam Sajjad's law treatise, professional ethics of professor's professional ethics in higher education, Requirements, of teaching professional ethics from the perspective of different universities in the world, requirements of teaching professional ethics from the perspective of Islamic teachings, ethical codes for nursing students in Iran and the world, and students' legal charter. The content of this handout was discussed in groups. Finally, the learners' reflective response to the intervention was examined in the form of a focus group. This educational intervention, which emphasized the problembased scenario with the help of roleplaying, was performed for 4 weeks on Tuesdays at the time of cultural discussion in the university. Stages of the study are presented in Figure 1.
Data were analyzed using Stata 14 MP (Statacorp,College Station, Texas, USA), descriptive statistics (frequency distribution, percentage, mean, and standard deviation), and analytical statistics (paired ttest). Results were reported at a significant level of 5%.

To prepare the students for the simulation, two articles about incivility, its causes and consequences were first sent to the participants via WhatsApp 2 weeks before the role playing. After reading the papers, the students discussed the papers in groups in the conference room. Furthermore, to familiarize the learners with the current situation, a study that was previously conducted in the same context was discussed by the learners in a separate meeting.[2]

Box 1: Scenario Teacher Students
Sepideh Narges Zahra Mehrnoush MohammadReza AmirHossein SeyyedReza

Content of the scenario
After entering the classroom and greeting the students, the teacher starts talking about the topic which is the treatment and control of diabetes. Zahra is listening to music using a handsfree headset. Teacher: Zahra, what were we talking about? Zahra is silent. Teacher: I think if you take the handsfree out of your ear and put away your cell phone, you will be more attentive. The teacher continues the lesson. Mehrnoush and Narges share their ideas on the subject with the teacher. Suddenly, SeyyedReza's cell phone rings and he leaves the classroom without taking permission. The teacher notices MohammadReza's improper way of sitting and tells him, "Please, sit correctly in the classroom .". SeyyedReza, meanwhile, enters the classroom without permission and takes his seat. Teacher: SeyyedReza, aren't you supposed to turn off your cell phone or at least put it on silent mode? You leave and enter the classroom without permission. SeyyedReza is just silent. The teacher continues teaching. AmirHossein: Teacher, this has nothing to do with us. This is doctor's job. We are just nurses. The other students confirm his idea. Teacher: You as a nurse should have complete information about diseases and the process of diagnosing and treating them, because patients want this information from you and you should reduce their anxiety through giving the necessary information to patients, and because patients' information is improving with the advancement of technology you have to be one step ahead of them. The students continue talking with their classmates. The teacher continues the discussion and realizes that Mehrnoush is reading a pamphlet about another subject. Teacher: Mehrnoush, what are you reading? Mehrnoush, I have a midterm exam. I haven't studied at all. Teacher: You are not allowed to study another subject during this class. Please, close your pamphlet. Following these conversations, AmirHossein and Sepideh say: Teacher, is it possible to cancel the midterm exam. Exam schedule is very busy. Teacher: No, it is not possible to cancel the exam. If the exam is cancelled, you will not study. Midterm exam is for reviewing the subjects and being prepared for the final exam. Do not worry about the exam and score. SeyyedReza: teacher, isn't it possible to assign some homework instead of the midterm exam? Teacher: No, guys, please finish the exam discussion. The only assistance that I can give you is postponing the exam. MohammadReza: professor, the time is up; we are going to miss the bus. SeyyedReza starts eating cheese puffs. Teacher: SeyyedReza, what are you doing? This is class! The teacher tries to calm down the class and continue teaching, but due to the commotion of the students, he decides to end the discussion and take a quiz about what has been discussed. Quiz sheets are distributed among the students. AmirHossein asks Sepideh to answer the questions. She is also talking to Zahra. The teacher moves AmirHossein to another seat. MohammadReza does not answer the questions. Teacher: Today you were in class. At least, you should know the answers to some of the questions. MohammadReza: Excuse me teacher, do you have a pen? The teacher is silent and gives him a pen. Teacher: AmirHossein, you are not writing anything, you are just waiting for the answers to the questions from Sepideh. ... Please hand in the sheets. The examination ends and the class is dismissed. Students leave the classroom in a hurry following the teacher.

Ethical considerations In order to observe ethical considerations and keep information confidential, anonymous questionnaires were used, and a separate code was assigned to each questionnaire. Ethics code (IR. LUMS. REC.1398.168) was obtained from Lorestan University of Medical Sciences.
Results
The average age of students was 22.46. Fortyeight point eight percent of these students were female, 95.5% were single and 88.8% were native people of Lorestan province. The mean of their grade point average was 14.59. Paired ttest showed that the mean score of students' civility index had a significant increase of 8.31 points after the intervention, but there was no significant difference between the mean score of civility index for classmates before and after the intervention. Furthermore, the results of the paired ttest showed that there is a significant difference between the mean score of perceived incivility before and after the intervention with a 5.88 points increase after the intervention [Table 1]. This fact confirmed the significant effect of the intervention in improving students' understanding of uncivil behaviors.

Primary codes extracted from the analysis of group interviews with students are presented in [Box 2].
Discussion
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a contextbased educational intervention on nursing students' civility index and their perception of civility. To prepare the students for the scenario, the journal club was used for students. Kerber et al.(2012) considered the civility journal club as a strategy to increase students' awareness of uncivil behavior. In their mixed study, the journal club was held for 69 nursing students; and the findings showed that the journal club increases awareness of uncivil behaviors, improves adaptation skills, and increases the use of problembased and rational approaches in stressful situations.[16] Jenkins et al. used six 65min journal club sessions with some active learning strategies for senior students. Students had useful experiences in the field of civility journal club.[24] The results of a study by Wendy et al.(2013) also revealed that holding sessions such as journal club is effective on nursing students' awareness of academic incivility and reducing the occurrence of these behaviors, which is consistent with the findings of the present study. In particular, presenting the journal club

Box 2: Some primary codes extracted from the analysis of group interviews with students Initial codes The need to familiarize students with incivility at the time of entering the university, holding monthly meetings and civility workshops, mutuality of incivility, students' familiarity with uncivil behaviors in the form of textbooks before the first semester, the effectiveness of the case scenario compared to other methods, the effectiveness of the scenario on sensitization, the possibility of selfassessment, the possibility of reviewing and rethinking their behaviors, the possibility of observing civil behaviors as an external observer, having a fun aspect, the need for education on interpersonal, the need for education on the way of communication between male and female students in the university environment, the need for education on conflict and stress management for teachers and students, the need to change students `beliefs and attitudes toward incivility, students' familiarity with some uncivil behaviors from the student's point of view such as studying the pamphlet of another subject in class and, sleeping during the class, etc., familiarity of students with the rights of learners
in the lower semesters, adding academic incivility courses to the curriculum, and dealing with uncivil behaviors in accordance with the regulations can reduce uncivil behaviors.[15]
Following the implementation of the problembased scenario, it was found that the students' civility index from the students' point of view was at the "average" level before the intervention, and this index was upgraded to the "civil" level with an increase of 8.31 points after the intervention. The results also confirmed the significant effect of the intervention in improving students' understanding of the importance of uncivil behaviors. The results of this study were in line with the results of the study conducted by Clark et al. they introduced a problembased scenario as an effective way to increase awareness of incivility.[1] Another study conducted by Hogan et al.(2018) found that using the "Blended learning resource" can be effective in increasing awareness and adaptive response of nursing and midwifery students toward incivility in the clinical environment.[25] Furthermore, the findings of the mixed study of Abedini and Parvizy showed that the use of problembased scenarios can increase students' perception of uncivil behaviors and reduce the occurrence of these behaviors.[26]
After the implementation of the scenario, a handout with the content of Islamic culture in the educational

environment of Iranian students was sent to the students as a selfstudy resource and its content was discussed in small groups in a facetoface meeting. In a similar study, Abedini and Parvizy analyzed the effect of group discussion and selfstudy on the civility of nursing students. The results showed that in both groups, there was an improvement in the rate of perception of incivility and its occurrence, but the average perception and frequency of uncivil behavior in the group discussion team was significantly higher than the selfstudy group.[18] In the present study, selflearning was also discussed in a meeting.
Thus, in the present study, based on the available evidence and texts, different strategies were used focusing on the problembased scenario. The results showed an improvement in the students' awareness of uncivil behaviors as well as an increase in the civility index among learners. In confirmation of the present study, Rutherford et al. have considered three strategies of including incivility in the educational curriculum, problembased learning, journal club presentation and cognitive practice as well as the use of training courses in healthcare centers, nursing management and legislation as effective strategies for increasing incivility awareness and perception and reducing uncivil behavior.[27]
In this study, the authors used their previous experience to identify uncivil behaviors and applied strategies to promote civility in the participants. Finally, at the end of the intervention, students' opinions about the intervention were examined in the form of a focus group. The need for training in communication skills, especially in the relationship between male and female students in the university environment, conflict, and stress management for teachers and students were among the codes extracted, which were also emphasized in the qualitative part of Abedini's study.[26] The need to get acquainted with incivility at the time of entering the university and holding frequent civility training sessions was another important point that was mentioned in interviews with students. In the study of Jenkins et al. students also wanted civility training sessions to be added to the curriculum in the first semester before uncivil behaviors turn into habit in learners.[24] The results of the study showed that the participants' understanding of some uncivil behaviors increased and they become

aware of these behaviors after the intervention. These results were compatible with the results of the study by Abedini and Parvizy.[26]
The present study was conducted using students' selfreport questionnaires. Due to the sensitivity of the issue, there was a possibility of dishonesty in answering and reduction in students' participation. Therefore, it was tried to tackle this problem as much as possible through distributing the questionnaires by people out of the research team. The workshops overlapping with the nursing students' other classes was another problem that was solved by holding workshops at the time of cultural sessions in the university (on Tuesdays from 10 to 12).
Conclusions
Considering the effectiveness of the problembased scenario along with other strategies such as journal club and selflearning in increasing the understanding of civil behavior and improving the civility index, using the results of this study is recommended to reduce incivility, especially in nursing students, due to their serious responsibility in healthcare system and patient safety.

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Nurses are in close contact with COVID19 patients and due to the high risk of infection, they experience fear and anxiety that can result in burnout. This study aimed to review the studies on burnout among nurses during the COVID19 epidemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study followed the guideline for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Metaanalysis (PRISMA). Using the keywords: "burnout," "nurse," and "COVID19" and with the help of Boolean operators, "AND" and "OR" the online databases, namely PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Science Direct were searched. Articles published from the first of February 2020 to 30 October, 2020 were retrieved. After the quality appraisal, the required data were extracted and analyzed.
RESULTS: Out of 85 articles identified in the initial search, and after removing duplicates and those that did not have the required data, seven articles entered the analysis. Among these articles, four (57.14%) reported moderate burnout and three articles (42.86) reported high level of burnout among nurses during the COVID19 pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: A majority of the studies reported that nurses experienced a moderate level of burnout during the COVID19 pandemic. Given the prevalence of burnout in nurses and because nurses are the largest portion of the healthcare providers who are in close contact with patients infected by COVID19, it is necessary for health care policymakers to adopt strategies for preventing or reducing burnout among nurses.

Introduction
On January 30, 2019, the World Health Organization announced the outbreak of a public health emergency and international concern[1] called coronavirus2019 (COVID19) which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.[2] In December 2019,[3] the COVID19 disease has emerged in Wuhan, China, and is spreading rapidly worldwide.[4] The COVID19 epidemic is now considered a global public health emergency.[2,5,6] Health care

workers, especially nurses who are in close contact with these patients, are at high risk of this infection and therefore, experience fear, anxiety, depression, and burnout.[7] Among health care workers, nurses make up the largest portion of the health care providers[8] and have always played an important role in infection prevention, infection control, isolation, containment, and public health.[4,9] When nurses are exposed to workplaces with high job demands and low resources, they experience symptoms of physical and emotional stress that consequently would affect their health.[9] In addition,

the COVID19 epidemic, and had been published from the first of February 2020-October 30, 2020.

Health professionals who care for COVID19 patients experience severe stress that can lead to burnout and decreased capacity to continue working.[11] Burnout has been described as a dangerous condition resulting from overwork and chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. It can lead to physical or mental illness.[2] Burnout can not only induce negative emotions but can also diminish positive emotions.[12] A study of health care professionals has shown a direct significant relationship between stress and burnout.[13] Another study revealed that during the COVID19 epidemic, physicians and nurses suffer from mental health problems, including burnout[14] due to the physical, mental, and social pressures they experience in the workplace.[11]
Because of the special nature of the nursing profession, clinical nurses experience different degrees of burnout. On the other hand, the fight against COVID19 is a big challenge; and the burnout of nurses caring for patients with COVID19 may not be the same as burnout experienced in other workrelated conditions.[2,15] Sporadic reports published on the prevalence of burnout among nurses who care for patients with COVID19 reported different rates. [16,17] Therefore, this study aimed to provide a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of burnout among nurses who cared for patients with COVID19.
Materials and Methods
A systematic review design was conducted in 2020 on studies that investigated the prevalence of burnout among nurses who cared for patients with COVID19. The study is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses guidelines.
Search strategy Relevant studies were identified through electronic searches of PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Science Direct. The snowballing method of searching the bibliographies of retrieved references was applied to identify relevant articles. The articles were screened first of February 2020-October 30, 2020. No language restrictions were imposed.

Study selection Twice reviewers screened titles and abstracts of all retrieved records for duplication. Full texts of all potentially relevant studies were then independently studied to determine the final study selection. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Duplicate information on the same patients was combined to obtain complete data.
Data extraction Study characteristics were extracted from eligible articles: Authors/Country/Year, Design and Method, Sampling, Sample size/Age group or mean age, Instrument used, Analysis methods, Important findings, The prevalence/severity of burnout among nurses, and P value.
Data synthesis Search results (n = 85) were exported to the EndNote software (v. X7) and two researchers independently screened their titles and abstracts to identify duplicate records. The reference lists of eligible articles were also handsearched for additional studies. Then, two reviewers independently appraised the quality of the retrieved studies using a checklist including the research method, validity, and reliability of data collection instruments, the sample size, and the absence of bias in data collection and statistic test and software.
A data collection form was used to extract data on the following items from the retrieved articles: Author, publication year, country, study design, sample size, sampling method, main results, burnout prevalence, level of significance, and conclusion. Figure 1 presents the process of the study. Table 1 shows levels of nurse's burnout during the COVID19 pandemic and Table 2 refers to a summary of the characteristics and the quality indicators of the included studies.
Ethical consideration To extract data from the mentioned articles, all ethical principles related to competing essays were observed. No attempt was made to obtain ethical approval due to the lack of sample collection and interview.
Discussion

Direct were searched using the following keywords: "burnout," "nurse," and "COVID19." Boolean operators, "AND" and "OR" were used to narrow or broaden search results. Articles were included if they were the reports of original researches, were in English, included data on the prevalence of burnout among nurses during

Four out of seven articles reviewed in the present study reported that nurses experienced a moderate level of burnout during the COVID19 pandemic and three articles reported high levels of burnout among nurses in the same period. Due to their responsibility for human health, continual confrontation with patients , [18]

performing clinical procedures, exposure to dying patients, dealing with emergency, and unpredictable situations, and exposure to too much noise at the workplace, nurses are exposed to high levels of work pressure.[19-21] Epidemiological studies have shown that about 17%-41% of nurses in different countries have symptoms of depression and approximately 20%-40% of them have symptoms of anxiety.[2,22] Anxiety and depression overlap with burnout. Burnout may also exacerbate negative emotions. Work pressure along with depression and anxiety would exacerbate job burnout.[12] Although nurses experience degrees of anxiety and depression during the COVID19 pandemic, anxiety has a greater effect on job burnout. A study also showed that each additional patient added to a nurse's workload was associated with a 23% increase in the probability of burnout.[4] Because burnout has a serious impact on nurses' mental health and work capacity,[2] and by reporting that 15.6% of nurses experience burnout, the Joint Commission for Quick safety advisory on Combating Nurse Burnout emphasized that organizations should remove barriers to nurses' workflow and workplace environment concerns to decrease the rate of burnout among them.[23] Nonetheless, selfcontrol and regulation of emotions are important in the handling of burnout and resolving difficult and anxiogenic workplace issues.[24] Consistently, studies reported that flexibility and feeling of selfefficacy as well as the effective use of organizational resources improve mental health, reduce anxiety, depression, and burnout among frontline nurses, and help them be prepared for stressful and difficult situations.[4,25] Some studies also showed that using stress management techniques, adequacy of hospital resources for the treatment of patients with COVID19, and support received from family, friends, colleagues, and superiors

can help reduce stress and burnout in nurses during the COVID19 epidemic.[17,24,26] Furthermore, the availability of mental health professionals for psychological counseling, social support, and protective measures for nosocomial infections can prevent burnout in nurses or help reduce it.[3,24] Studies also confirmed the role of a balance between rest and activity, good nutrition and exercise, personal hobbies, entertainment, and timely vacations in the reduction of chronic stress, anxiety, and burnout in employees, especially when they feel overwhelmed.[24] Therefore, nursing managers and hospital authorities should pay more attention to health care workers, - especially nurses - and design longterm preventive plans, reduce working shifts, and find the sources of stress and resolve them to manage not only the ongoing outbreak but also to control future pandemics.[17]
Limitations and recommendation Limited studies have been published on the prevalence of burnout among nurses in the COVID19 pandemic. The results of these studies might not be generalized. Therefore, further studies should be conducted in this area.
Conclusion
A majority of the studies reviewed reported that nurses experienced a moderate level of burnout during the COVID19 pandemic. Given the prevalence of burnout in nurses and its consequences, and because nurses are the largest group of the health care providers in service of patients with COVID19, it is necessary for health care policymakers to adopt appropriate strategies and methods to prevent or reduce burnout among nurses. Increasing personal protection equipment, providing alternative workforce, and periodic rotation of frontline nurses, providing adequate organizational, and social support, and ensuring their willingness to work as frontline can help prevent or reduce burnout among nurses.
Acknowledgments The authors would like to appreciate the efforts of all health care providers, - especially nurses - in dealing with COVID19.

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Nurses are in close contact with COVID19 patients and due to the high risk of infection, they experience fear and anxiety that can result in burnout. This study aimed to review the studies on burnout among nurses during the COVID19 epidemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study followed the guideline for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Metaanalysis (PRISMA). Using the keywords: "burnout," "nurse," and "COVID19" and with the help of Boolean operators, "AND" and "OR" the online databases, namely PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Science Direct were searched. Articles published from the first of February 2020 to 30 October, 2020 were retrieved. After the quality appraisal, the required data were extracted and analyzed.
RESULTS: Out of 85 articles identified in the initial search, and after removing duplicates and those that did not have the required data, seven articles entered the analysis. Among these articles, four (57.14%) reported moderate burnout and three articles (42.86) reported high level of burnout among nurses during the COVID19 pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: A majority of the studies reported that nurses experienced a moderate level of burnout during the COVID19 pandemic. Given the prevalence of burnout in nurses and because nurses are the largest portion of the healthcare providers who are in close contact with patients infected by COVID19, it is necessary for health care policymakers to adopt strategies for preventing or reducing burnout among nurses.

Introduction
On January 30, 2019, the World Health Organization announced the outbreak of a public health emergency and international concern[1] called coronavirus2019 (COVID19) which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.[2] In December 2019,[3] the COVID19 disease has emerged in Wuhan, China, and is spreading rapidly worldwide.[4] The COVID19 epidemic is now considered a global public health emergency.[2,5,6] Health care

workers, especially nurses who are in close contact with these patients, are at high risk of this infection and therefore, experience fear, anxiety, depression, and burnout.[7] Among health care workers, nurses make up the largest portion of the health care providers[8] and have always played an important role in infection prevention, infection control, isolation, containment, and public health.[4,9] When nurses are exposed to workplaces with high job demands and low resources, they experience symptoms of physical and emotional stress that consequently would affect their health.[9] In addition,

the COVID19 epidemic, and had been published from the first of February 2020-October 30, 2020.

Health professionals who care for COVID19 patients experience severe stress that can lead to burnout and decreased capacity to continue working.[11] Burnout has been described as a dangerous condition resulting from overwork and chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. It can lead to physical or mental illness.[2] Burnout can not only induce negative emotions but can also diminish positive emotions.[12] A study of health care professionals has shown a direct significant relationship between stress and burnout.[13] Another study revealed that during the COVID19 epidemic, physicians and nurses suffer from mental health problems, including burnout[14] due to the physical, mental, and social pressures they experience in the workplace.[11]
Because of the special nature of the nursing profession, clinical nurses experience different degrees of burnout. On the other hand, the fight against COVID19 is a big challenge; and the burnout of nurses caring for patients with COVID19 may not be the same as burnout experienced in other workrelated conditions.[2,15] Sporadic reports published on the prevalence of burnout among nurses who care for patients with COVID19 reported different rates. [16,17] Therefore, this study aimed to provide a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of burnout among nurses who cared for patients with COVID19.
Materials and Methods
A systematic review design was conducted in 2020 on studies that investigated the prevalence of burnout among nurses who cared for patients with COVID19. The study is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses guidelines.
Search strategy Relevant studies were identified through electronic searches of PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Science Direct. The snowballing method of searching the bibliographies of retrieved references was applied to identify relevant articles. The articles were screened first of February 2020-October 30, 2020. No language restrictions were imposed.

Study selection Twice reviewers screened titles and abstracts of all retrieved records for duplication. Full texts of all potentially relevant studies were then independently studied to determine the final study selection. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Duplicate information on the same patients was combined to obtain complete data.
Data extraction Study characteristics were extracted from eligible articles: Authors/Country/Year, Design and Method, Sampling, Sample size/Age group or mean age, Instrument used, Analysis methods, Important findings, The prevalence/severity of burnout among nurses, and P value.
Data synthesis Search results (n = 85) were exported to the EndNote software (v. X7) and two researchers independently screened their titles and abstracts to identify duplicate records. The reference lists of eligible articles were also handsearched for additional studies. Then, two reviewers independently appraised the quality of the retrieved studies using a checklist including the research method, validity, and reliability of data collection instruments, the sample size, and the absence of bias in data collection and statistic test and software.
A data collection form was used to extract data on the following items from the retrieved articles: Author, publication year, country, study design, sample size, sampling method, main results, burnout prevalence, level of significance, and conclusion. Figure 1 presents the process of the study. Table 1 shows levels of nurse's burnout during the COVID19 pandemic and Table 2 refers to a summary of the characteristics and the quality indicators of the included studies.
Ethical consideration To extract data from the mentioned articles, all ethical principles related to competing essays were observed. No attempt was made to obtain ethical approval due to the lack of sample collection and interview.
Discussion

Direct were searched using the following keywords: "burnout," "nurse," and "COVID19." Boolean operators, "AND" and "OR" were used to narrow or broaden search results. Articles were included if they were the reports of original researches, were in English, included data on the prevalence of burnout among nurses during

Four out of seven articles reviewed in the present study reported that nurses experienced a moderate level of burnout during the COVID19 pandemic and three articles reported high levels of burnout among nurses in the same period. Due to their responsibility for human health, continual confrontation with patients , [18]

performing clinical procedures, exposure to dying patients, dealing with emergency, and unpredictable situations, and exposure to too much noise at the workplace, nurses are exposed to high levels of work pressure.[19-21] Epidemiological studies have shown that about 17%-41% of nurses in different countries have symptoms of depression and approximately 20%-40% of them have symptoms of anxiety.[2,22] Anxiety and depression overlap with burnout. Burnout may also exacerbate negative emotions. Work pressure along with depression and anxiety would exacerbate job burnout.[12] Although nurses experience degrees of anxiety and depression during the COVID19 pandemic, anxiety has a greater effect on job burnout. A study also showed that each additional patient added to a nurse's workload was associated with a 23% increase in the probability of burnout.[4] Because burnout has a serious impact on nurses' mental health and work capacity,[2] and by reporting that 15.6% of nurses experience burnout, the Joint Commission for Quick safety advisory on Combating Nurse Burnout emphasized that organizations should remove barriers to nurses' workflow and workplace environment concerns to decrease the rate of burnout among them.[23] Nonetheless, selfcontrol and regulation of emotions are important in the handling of burnout and resolving difficult and anxiogenic workplace issues.[24] Consistently, studies reported that flexibility and feeling of selfefficacy as well as the effective use of organizational resources improve mental health, reduce anxiety, depression, and burnout among frontline nurses, and help them be prepared for stressful and difficult situations.[4,25] Some studies also showed that using stress management techniques, adequacy of hospital resources for the treatment of patients with COVID19, and support received from family, friends, colleagues, and superiors

can help reduce stress and burnout in nurses during the COVID19 epidemic.[17,24,26] Furthermore, the availability of mental health professionals for psychological counseling, social support, and protective measures for nosocomial infections can prevent burnout in nurses or help reduce it.[3,24] Studies also confirmed the role of a balance between rest and activity, good nutrition and exercise, personal hobbies, entertainment, and timely vacations in the reduction of chronic stress, anxiety, and burnout in employees, especially when they feel overwhelmed.[24] Therefore, nursing managers and hospital authorities should pay more attention to health care workers, - especially nurses - and design longterm preventive plans, reduce working shifts, and find the sources of stress and resolve them to manage not only the ongoing outbreak but also to control future pandemics.[17]
Limitations and recommendation Limited studies have been published on the prevalence of burnout among nurses in the COVID19 pandemic. The results of these studies might not be generalized. Therefore, further studies should be conducted in this area.
Conclusion
A majority of the studies reviewed reported that nurses experienced a moderate level of burnout during the COVID19 pandemic. Given the prevalence of burnout in nurses and its consequences, and because nurses are the largest group of the health care providers in service of patients with COVID19, it is necessary for health care policymakers to adopt appropriate strategies and methods to prevent or reduce burnout among nurses. Increasing personal protection equipment, providing alternative workforce, and periodic rotation of frontline nurses, providing adequate organizational, and social support, and ensuring their willingness to work as frontline can help prevent or reduce burnout among nurses.

Abstract
Background: The consumption of controlled substances in North Carolina and the nation has created a health crisis with epidemic levels of medication diversion, abuse, overdose and death. Primary care providers are the principal prescribers of controlled substances and at greatest risk of encountering patients that abuse medications. Guidelines recommend patient agreements with monitoring requirements when prescribing opioids and stimulants. Studies have focused on opioids and excluded stimulants. Adherence to recommended monitoring requirements has not been fully evaluated. Methodology: This was a quality improvement project using the Plan-Do-Check-Act procedure. The following outcome measures were evaluated: signed agreement on file, prescription monitoring program (pmp) checks, urine screens, and prescriptions written without a mandatory visit. Implementation: Who: patients aged 19 and over prescribed a long-term Schedule II medication for the chronic conditions of pain and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. What: implemented a patient agreement and measured fidelity to components of the agreement. When: seven months pre- to seven months post-implementation. Where: in an adult primary care practice with approximately 2,500 patients. How: an agreement was implemented with monthly feedback provided. Results: Post-implementation, 94% of patients meeting criteria had a signed agreement in their medical record. Adherence to urine screening improved from 5.3% to 71.1%. Guideline adherence to pmp checks improved from 11.3% to 99.0%. Guideline deviation for prescriptions written without a visit improved from 20.6% to 0%. All improvements were statistically significant (P < .001). Conclusion: A Schedule II controlled substance patient agreement was successfully implemented in a primary care practice reducing risk for both the patient and provider.

Introduction
The consumption of controlled substances has increased dramatically in North Carolina and across the nation. The result is a public health crisis with epidemic levels of medication diversion, misuse, abuse, unintentional overdose, and death.[17] Schedule II medications are controlled substances that fall into two distinct categories: opioid analgesics used to treat pain and nonnarcotic stimulants popular for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). US consumption of Schedule II medications, most notably opioids, exceeds that of any other country in the world. Currently, Americans consume 99% of the global

hydrocodone supply and 78% of the global oxycodone supply but comprise only 4.6% of the world's population.[810] The centers for disease control reports that in 2014, opioidrelated deaths totaled 28,647 which is 61% of all drug overdose fatalities.[11]
In response to this increase in unintentional deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a 2016 guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain.[12] The guideline includes 12 specific recommendations to guide providers in three areas: (1) when to initiate or continue opioids, (2) how to select, dose, continue or discontinue opioids, and (3) how to assess risk and harm of opioids. Also in 2016, the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee

published the "National Pain Strategy."[13] This report highlights strategies to address the continuing problem of unrelieved chronic pain and how to treat it in the context of increased unintentional deaths from opioids. The report highlights the need for improvements in the clinical delivery of pain therapies and the need for professional education and training in chronic pain. Both reports are critical to primary care providers because they are the principal prescribers of controlled substances and a major source of potentially harmful medications.[4,10,12,1418] As deaths from overdose increase, primary care providers become reluctant to prescribe controlled medications fearing litigation, regulatory issues, and loss of professional license. In response, the American Pain Society, the Federation of State Medical Boards, and the North Carolina Medical Board published detailed and comprehensive guidelines to encourage responsible prescribing with the goals of increasing patient safety and reducing prescriber risk.[1820] The recommendations included patient agreements and monitoring tools such as urine screens, early refill restrictions, and prescription monitoring programs.
Consensus regarding best practice is that patient agreements assist healthcare providers in reducing risks associated with the prescription of controlled substances and promote patient safety by increasing patient commitment to the prescribed plan of care. [2,3,10,2126] The Federation of State Medical Boards developed a patient agreement model that incorporates many of the recommended monitoring tools and the agreement has been endorsed by the joint commission and adopted or adapted by 46 states.[20,27]
Before May 1, 2015, the clinical setting reported in this manuscript did not offer a Schedule II controlled substance patient agreement. Urine screens and prescription monitoring checks were performed randomly at the discretion of the physician. The healthcare team acknowledged that the potential diversion, misuse, and abuse of controlled substances coupled with the lack of a patient agreement and limited adherence monitoring, placed the patient, prescriber, practice, and public at risk.
A Schedule II controlled substance patient agreement was introduced in an effort to improve the care of patients prescribed longterm controlled substances and to control potential medication resale and abuse, a task the physicians viewed as their social responsibility. The patient agreement bundled three measures: urine screens, prescription monitoring program checks, and prescriptions written without a 3 month mandatory visit. Fidelity to the bundled elements was compared 7 months pre and postimplementation of the patient agreement to determine the effect of the practice change.
Materials and Methods
Design
This quality improvement project used a pre/post design to compare data 7 months pre to 7 months postimplementation

of a Schedule II controlled substance patient agreement in an adult primary care practice. The 7month time frame allowed for at least two medication management visits scheduled at 3month intervals. The project was reviewed by the Duke University Institutional Review Board and deemed exempt.
Setting
The clinical setting was an adult primary care practice located in a small, urban area in North Carolina with approximately 2500 patients, two physicians, two licensed nurses, and no advanced practice nurses or nurse practitioners. The practice accepted private insurance and Medicare but did not accept Medicaid.
Sample
All patients age 19 and over prescribed a longterm Schedule II medication for the chronic conditions of pain (ICD10 G89.4) and/or ADHD (ICD10 F90.0) were initially included in the sample. The following exclusion criteria were used: pregnancy, discontinuation of medication, loss of insurance coverage, decision to have medications prescribed elsewhere (i.e., psychiatrist, pain specialist, etc.), and noshow during the study period. The final sample size was n = 50. Only patient visits directly related to the prescribing of Schedule II controlled substance medications were included in the dataset. Unrelated visits were excluded from this study.
Schedule II controlled substance patient agreement
Sample patient agreement models were retrieved online, reviewed and modified to fit the needs of the clinical setting. The final patient agreement included a clear purpose statement and prescription policy. Responsibilities of the patient and physician were clearly described. Privacy issues were addressed as well as the implications of a patient's refusal to sign or abide by the agreement. The agreement required the following practice changes: a signed, Schedule II patient agreement in the patient's medical file; check of the stateimplemented prescription monitoring program at each clinic visit pertaining to controlled substances; random urine screens at least one screen/patient/12 months period; and no prescriptions written outside a 3month mandatory visit.
Implementation
The patient agreement was developed and adopted by the practice before the implementation date of May 1, 2015. Throughout development and implementation of the agreement, the physicians remained sensitive to the drug seeker stereotype often endured by patients prescribed controlled substances. The physicians created and presented the agreement as a proactive patient education and safety tool, not a punitive, law enforcementtype activity.[15] Staff and providers received education throughout the project process. One week before implementation, a formal training session was held to answer remaining questions regarding the patient agreement and policy.

Downey, et al.: Controlled substance treatment agreement

Data were collected and tracked weekly to measure policy adherence to protocol and to identify the necessary process or education changes to influence continual improvement. Data were shared with providers at monthly staff meetings.
The Schedule II controlled substance patient agreement was implemented in the practice setting beginning May 1, 2015. The nurse presented the agreement to the patient, explained its contents, and asked the patient to carefully review the contract before the physician entered the examination room. The physician addressed any contract questions or concerns presented by the patient. Then, the patient and physician signed the contract. After verifying signatures, the office assistant placed the contract in the patient's medical record. The clinical setting used both electronic and paper charts. The patient agreement was presented in paper format. The document was scanned into electronic charts and filed into paper charts. The patient was offered a copy as a personal record.
During patient visits, nurses collected and processed urine samples as ordered by the physician. Per protocol, one urine drug screen was required per 12 months period. Samples were sent to a contracted laboratory facility for analysis. Urine screen results were received from the laboratory in both paper and electronic format and entered into patient files accordingly. A nurse was assigned to check the statewide prescription monitoring program before all scheduled medication management visits. The prescription monitoring program report document was scanned into electronic charts and filed in paper charts.
Outcome variables
The primary outcomes were a patient agreement on file and adherence to three components bundled in the patient agreement. The variable "signed agreement on file" represented the number of patients with signed agreements in their chart postimplementation. Pre/post variables included, (1) urine screena measurement that compared the number of urine screens performed on matched pairs pre and postimplementation to determine the percentage of adherence to agreement guidelines, (2) prescription monitoring program check - a measure of checks completed on the statewide prescription monitoring system and documented in the medical record divided by the number of patient visits to determine the percentage of adherence to agreement guidelines; and (3) prescriptions written without a mandatory visit - a measure of prescriptions written for patients that did not fulfill the mandatory 3month controlled substance patient visit divided by the number of patient visits and potential visits (phone calls and/or portal messages) to determine the percentage of deviation from agreement guidelines. Demographic and descriptive data included gender, age, race, and diagnosis code.
Medical records audit
Paper and electronic files were accessed retrospectively to abstract preimplementation data from Jan 1, 2014, to July 31, 2014. Postimplementation data were collected through the

patient medical record within one week of all Schedule II related medication management visits.
Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to describe sample characteristics. The percentage of patients with a signed agreement postimplementation was determined by dividing the number of patients with a signed agreement in their chart by the number of patients meeting the inclusion criteria. Because patient agreements were not used in the practice setting before the project, a prepost comparison was not possible. Nonparametric tests were used to compare percentage averages pre and postimplementation for the three remaining outcome variables. Adherence to urine screen testing was measured using McNemar's test to determine the difference between paired proportions of patients screened preimplementation versus patients screened postimplementation. Wilcoxon's signed rank test was used to calculate the significance of the pre/post percentage differences for prescription program monitoring and prescriptions written without a mandatory visit. The nonparametric tests were performed using IBM's Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 IBM (International Business Machines, Armonk, NY).
Results
The initial sample included 69 patients, 19 of which met valid exceptions for not signing a patient agreement, leaving a final sample of n = 50 patients. Exclusions included pregnancy (n = 1), noshow during study (n = 5), medication discontinued (n = 6), medication prescribed elsewhere (n = 5), and loss of insurance (n = 2). Table 1 displays a detailed description of the sample characteristics. The mean (standard deviation) age was 50.7 (16.3). Of the final sample (n = 50), the majority of patients were white (96.0%) and female (62.0%). There was almost an equal proportion of Schedule II medications prescribed for chronic pain and ADHD.

Discussion
Guidelines and regulations for the prescribing of controlled substances have been available for more than 5 years and have been proven to reduce risk and improve patient compliance.[2126] In spite of guideline success, the CDC and The National Pain Council reported as recently as March 2016 that providers do not consistently implement practices such as patient agreements, prescription monitoring programs, and urine screens that decrease the risk for misuse.[12,13] Providers assert that guideline compliance interrupts the normal clinical workflow and consumes valuable time.[12] We conducted this quality improvement project to demonstrate that it is possible to successfully implement in a small primary care practice a patient agreement and monitoring policy that fulfills governmental guidelines and recommendations for prescribing Schedule II medications for chronic conditions such as pain and ADHD.
Implementation of the recommended opioid prescribing practices can be daunting, and noncompliance with recommendations has been addressed in numerous studies. Hariharan et al. retrospectively examined patient agreement adherence and cancellation.[22] The authors determined that primary care physicians did not routinely monitor for patient agreement adherence, did not have standardized protocol for urine screening, and performed urine screens on <45% of eligible patients. Khalid et al. analyzed physician adherence to opioid prescribing guidelines and potential patient opioid misuse based on physician status of either attending or resident.[18] Less than half of patients in either group were presented with a patient agreement, less than twothirds received a urine screen, and over onethird were granted multiple, early refills. Lasser et al. reported baseline characteristics for three primary care study sites. On average, 45.3% of patients were offered a patient agreement, 39.7% received urine screens, and 35% received early refills.[16] After implementation of four strategies (nurse care management, use of a patient registry, academic detailing, and electronic tools), the authors determined that provider adherence to prescribing guidelines improved. Similar to our project, these studies concluded that intervention

components related to safe prescribing guidelines for controlled substances have the potential to increase provider adherence and reduce patient misuse of controlled medications. Unlike our study, the authors focused specifically on opioidrelated measures and excluded stimulants, an important, but often overlooked, category of Schedule II medications.
In our study, a large proportion of patients received prescription stimulants. Federal and state agencies have grouped opioids and stimulants under the same Schedule II umbrella and impose identical guidelines and regulations, but the potential illegal uses and outcomes of opioids versus stimulants are quite different. Opioids have a greater potential for addiction, overdose, and death. Stimulants, or nonnarcotics, have a greater potential for diversion and misuse. Stimulant abuse is often ignored in the Schedule II literature, but diversion and misuse is a growing problem, especially in the collegeage population.[28] Our study adds to the literature in that it examined not only the number of signed patient agreements but also measured adherence to specific components of the agreement and monitored both narcotics and stimulants in a time and costeffective manner.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to measure improvements in adherence to the bundled components of a signed, Schedule II patient agreement after implementation in a primary care practice. Implementation was a success in that it enhanced the prescribers' ability to continue to safely meet the medication needs of their patients while reducing prescriber risk. All reported measures dramatically improved from pre to posttime periods. Adherence to guidelines for both urine screen monitoring and prescription monitoring program checks increased significantly. The physicians' commitment to not writing prescriptions outside the 3month mandatory visit was especially impressive with no prescriptions written postimplementation outside the 3month window.
The implementation process was compatible with the office workflow. While we did not directly measure cost, we believe the associated implementation cost was minimal. The time cost factor to introduce and explain the agreement to patients was negligible. The nurse staff performed all prescription monitoring checks during slow periods of the day. The monitoring program was state funded with free access to registered users. The patient

incurred drug screening costs only in circumstances where insurance refused payment. In these rare cases, the tests were billed at the physician's fee, which is a substantially discounted rate. No patient complaints with regard to laboratory costs were received.
Some barriers to implementation were encountered. During the implementation, the laboratory that performed the urine screens introduced new software that required staff training and complicated the creation of custom laboratory panels necessary for drugspecific testing. Three patients expressed privacy concerns regarding urine screens. The concerns did not arise while signing the agreement but at the time of urine collection. Patients were reminded that the tests were specific only to the medication prescribed and included no other results or information. No patients refused to provide a urine sample for screening or refused to sign the agreement. Three patients have no agreement on file because the nurse forgot to offer the opportunity to review and sign the contract.
Limitations
Several limitations apply to our project. The project was conducted in a single, private practice with only two providers and a specific, local culture. Both providers were extremely motivated and engaged in the project. Results are not generalizable to larger practices with multiple providers in which implementation may be more challenging. Our experience can be translated to the many small, primary care practices seeking to comply with the current guidelines for prescribing Schedule II controlled substances. Patients prescribed Schedule II medications were overwhelmingly Caucasian (96%) and aged <60 (44%) and may not be applicable to patients with differing demographic characteristics. Adherence was not monitored beyond 7 months postimplementation. Individual practices should actively monitor policy adherence until the practice pattern becomes embedded in daily routine. No data were collected with regard to the patient's or physician's perception of the policy. While we did not collect this data, patients repeatedly expressed a clear understanding of the purpose of the agreement and seemed to view the contract positively. The providers showed support of the agreement by striving to adhere to agreement components. We did not collect preexisting substance abuse or other risk factors of opioid addiction or misuse. This data would be helpful in describing whether or not the population studied was high risk for opioid abuse. Finally, no data were collected regarding patient outcomes, therefore, we do not know if pain continued to be adequately managed. Despite these limitations, the project demonstrated the ability to introduce a Schedule II controlled substance patient agreement in a small primary care practice with excellent adherence to the required components of the contract. Future studies should replicate this project at several practices with different practice characteristics and monitor adherence for a longer duration.

Conclusion
The implementation of a Schedule II controlled substance patient agreement and prescribing policy in a small primary care practice was feasible and significantly improved the number of patient agreements signed, annual urine screens performed, and prescription monitoring program checks completed; and significantly decreased the number of Schedule II prescriptions written outside a mandatory 3month office visit.

Modulation of the Na,K-Pump Function
by 13 Subunit Isoforms

BERNARD C. ROSSIER, a n d JEAN-DANIEL HORISBERGER
From the Institut de Pharmacologie et de Toxicologie, 1005 Lausanne, Switzerland
ABSTRACT To study the role of the Na,K-ATPase 13 subunit in the ion transport
activity, we have coexpressed the Bufo ~1 subunit (cd) with three different isotypes of [3 subunits, the Bufo Na,K-ATPase 131 ([31NaK) or [~3 (fl3NaK) subunit or the [3 subunit of the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase ([3HK), by cRNA injection in Xenopus
oocyte. We studied the K÷ activation kinetics by measuring the Na,K-pump current induced by external K÷ under voltage clamp conditions. The endogenous oocyte Na,K-ATPase was selectively inhibited, taking advantage of the large difference in
ouabain sensitivity between Xenopusand Bufo Na,K pumps. The K÷ half-activation
constant (K1/2) was higher in the etl[33NaK than in the al[31NaK groups in the presence of external Na +, but there was no significant difference in the absence of external Na +. Association of ~1 and [3HK subunits produced active Na,K pumps with a much lower apparent affinity for K÷ both in the presence and in the absence
of external Na +. The voltage dependence of the K1/2for external K+ was similar
with the three [3 subunits. Our results indicate that the [3 subunit has a significant influence on the ion transport activity of the Na,K pump. The small structural differences between the [31NaK and 133NaK subunits results in a difference of the apparent affinity for K÷ that is measurable only in the presence of external Na ÷, and thus appears not to be directly related to the K+ binding site. In contrast, association of an ~1 subunit with a [3HK subunit results in a Na,K pump in which the K+ binding or translocating mechanisms are altered since the apparent affinity for external K+ is affected even in the absence of external Na +.
INTRODUCTION
The Na,K p u m p is composed of an a~ heterodimer. The two subunits are assembled soon after synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (Geering, 1990). Although neither hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) nor ion transport function by an isolated subunit has ever been demonstrated, the a subunit has been called the catalytic subunit because it includes the binding site for ATP (Pedemonte and Kaplan, 1990) and the catalytic phosphorylation site (Ohtsubo, Noguchi, Takeda, Morohashi, and Kawamura, 1990). In addition, several lines of evidence (site-directed mutagenesis, covalent binding of ouabain analogues) clearly indicate that the binding site of

ouabain, the Na,K pump-specific inhibitor, is primarily located on the ,x subunit; for review see Horisberger, Lemas, Kraehenbtihl, and Rossier (1991c). T h e [3 subunit has a major role in the maturation and the translocation of the Na, K-pump protein from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane; for review see Geering (1991). However, the role of this 13subunit, once the Na,K pump is in its mature and active form at the plasma membrane, is poorly understood.
The structure of the e~ subunit (with 8-10 putative transmembrane segments) and the existence of other ion-motive P-ATPases that do not include a 13subunit make it probable that the a subunit forms the binding sites and the pathway for the transported cations. However, the possibility of a contribution of the 13subunit (that includes only one transmembrane segment) is still open. A few recent reports point to this possible role (Eakle, Kim, Kabalin, and Farley, 1992; Schmalzing, Kr6ner, Schachner, and Gloor, 1992; Jaisser, Canessa, Horisberger, and Rossier, 1992a; Jaisser, Horisberger, and Rossier, 1992b; Lutsenko and Kaplan, 1992). In addition, selective chemical modifications of the [3 subunit of the gastric H,K-ATPase have been shown to entail loss of function of the holoenzyme (Chow, Browning, and Forte, 1992).
We have reported that the Xenopus [33NaK subunit, as well as the [31NaK isoform, could assemble with the ,xl subunit to form a functional Na,K pump at the plasma membrane of Xenopus oocytes but we were not able to detect any significant physiological differences between the aliB1NaK and ~1 [33NaK complexes (Horisberger, Jaunin, Good, Rossier, and Geering, 1991a). However, this approach was not powerful enough to detect small physiological differences between Na,K-pump isoforms expressed by cRNA injection, because the noise of the endogenous oocyte Na,K pump was added to the signal of the exogenous Na,K pump. More recently, using the Xenopus and Bufo e~and [3 subunits, we could show a consistent difference in the apparent affinity for external K+ between Na,K pumps including a [3 subunit of the [31 and [33 isotype. In the present paper, we have extended this work by studying the kinetics of the activation by external K+ of Na,K pumps composed of an ~x subunit and either one of the two known amphibian isoforms of the [3 subunit, [31NaK or [33NaK (Verrey, Kairouz, Schaerer, Fuentes, Geering, Rossier, and Kraehenbtihl, 1989; Good, Richter, and Dawid, 1990; Jaisser et al., 1992a), or the [3 subunit of the most closely related P-ATPase, the stomach H-K-ATPase; for review see Wallmark, Lorentzon, and Sachs (1990). In addition, the effects of the membrane potential and of the presence or absence of external Na + on apparent K+ affinity of all these isoforms was studied. The (x subunit of the Bufo marinus Na-K-ATPase was chosen because it is well expressed in Xenopus oocytes and it confers a relative resistance to ouabain, allowing the study of the function of the artificially expressed Bufo Na,K pump after selective inhibition of the endogenous Xenopus Na,K pump (Jaisser et al., 1992a, b).

METHODS
Expression of a and ~ Subunits cRNAs in Xenopus Oocytes
Synthetic cRNAs coding for the al subunit and [31NaK and [33NaK subunits of the Na,KATPase of Bufo marinus (Jaisser et al., 1992a), were prepared from cDNAs subcloned in pSD

JAISSER ET AL. 13 Subunit and Na,K-PumpFunction

vectors containing a 110-bp poly-A tail (Good, Welch, Barkan, Somasekhar, and Mertz, 1988).
Similarly cRNA coding for the 13 subunit of the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase (Reuben, Lasater,
and Sachs, 1990) were prepared. Capped cRNAs were synthesized using SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega Corp., Madison, Wl) as described earlier (Melton, Krieg, Rebagliati, Maniatis, Zinn,
and Green, 1984; Horisberger et al., 1991a).
Stage V-VI Xenopusoocytes were obtained as previously described (Horisberger et al., 1991a)
and were injected with 10 ng of Na,K-ATPase et subunit cRNA and 1 ng of Na,K-ATPase 13
subunit, or 4 ng of H,K-ATPase 15 subunit cRNA in a total volume of 50 nl. We have shown
previously that co-injection of (~ and 131NaKor 133NaKcRNA of Bufo Na,K-ATPase induces a large increase in the activity of Na,K pumps at the surface of Xenopus oocytes, when compared
to oocytes injected with water, et subunit alone or I~ subunit alone (Jaisser et al., 1992a).
Similarly, co-injection ofXenopus Na,K-ATPase ct and rat gastric H,K-ATPase 13subunit cRNAs
was shown to result in the expression of functional Na,K-pump (Horisberger, Jaunin, Reuben, Lasater, Chow, Forte, Sachs, and Rossier, 1991b).

Electrophysiological Measurements of Na,K-Pump Activity
Na,K-pump activity was measured in Na÷-Ioaded oocytes as the outward current activated by addition of K+, in the presence of K+ channel blockers, as described earlier (Horisberger et al., 1991a). Briefly, 3-5 d after cRNA injection, the oocytes were first loaded with Na + by a 2-h exposure to a K+-free and Ca++-free solution. They were kept thereafter in a K+ free solution containing 0.4 mM Ca++ until the measurements were performed. Whole-cell currents were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Current and voltage were recorded under voltage clamp conditions with a Dagan TEV-200 clamp instrument (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). The TL-1 DMA interface and Pclamp data acquisition program (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) were used to drive the voltage clamp and record voltage and current signals at a sampling rate of 1 KHz. The current signal was low-pass filtered at 25 Hz.
Whole-cell current-voltage (I-V) curves were obtained by recording the current while, starting
from a holding membrane potential of - 5 0 mV, rectangular voltage pulses (125 ms) of varying amplitude (from +80 to - 8 0 mV) were applied every 1.5 s and the steady state current was measured at 100 ms after the start of the voltage step.

Specific Measurement of the Exogenously Expressed Na,K Pump
To measure specifically the activity of the exogenous Bufo Na,K pumps we took advantage of the relative resistance to ouabain of the Bufo Na,K pump (K~ ~ 50 I~M)and its fast dissociation rate constant (Jaisser et al., 1992a) compared to the Xenopus Na,K pump (KI < 0.1 I~M)
(Canessa, Horisberger, Louvard, and Rossier, 1992). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the activity of the
endogenous Xenopus Na,K pump was inhibited by exposure for 1 min to 10 I~M ouabain. We have shown that this manoeuvre completely inhibits the XenopusNa,K pump for a period of at
least 15 min (Canessa et al., 1992; Jaisser et al., 1992a). Ouabain was then removed and a
4-8-min period was allowed for the recovery of the small part of the Bufo Na,K-pump activity
that could have been transiently inhibited by the 10 IxM ouabain (see Fig. 1).

Activation of the Na,K Pump by External Potassium
The activation of the Na,K-pump current by external K+ was studied in two separate sets of experiments, in the presence and in the nominal absence of external Na ÷. In the Na + containing solutions, the K+-induced current was measured after a stepwise increase of the K+ concentration from 0.0 to 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 raM. In the Na+-free solutions the K+ concentrations were 0.0, 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, and 5.0 raM. The various K+ concentrations were obtained by addition of adequate amounts of K-gluconate to the corresponding K+-free

The current induced by K+ at each potential was obtained by subtracting the current measured in the K+-free solution from the current measured in the presence of K÷. The parameters of the Hill equation:

I = Imax/[l + (KI/2/CK)"~]

(1)

were fitted to the data of the current (I) induced by various concentration of K+ (CK) and yielded least square estimates of the maximal current (/max), the half-activation constant (Kt/2, and the Hill coefficient (nil). The voltage dependence of Kl/~ was obtained by fitting the
parameters of the exponential function:

Kl/2 = KI/2(O)'exp(kFV/RT)

(2)

to the Kl:~vs. V,, data to obtain least square estimates of the K~/~at 0 mV [Kl:2(0)] and k, an
exponential steepness factor. A nonlinear fit program based on the simplex method (Nelder and Mead, 1965) was used for fitting equations to the data.
All experiments were performed at room temperature (24--26°C). Na, K-pump current measurements were restricted to oocytes showing a membrane resistance > 0.25 MI~. As no differences were observed in water-injected (50 nl) or noninjected oocytes, oocytes of these two groups were pooled to form the "control" group.

Solutions and Drugs
The composition of the solutions used for the electrophysiological measurements were as follows: Na+-containing solution (mM) Na ÷ 87, Ca ++ 0.41, Mg++ 0.82, Ba+÷ 5, TEA+ 10, gluconate 90, CI- 22.5, HCO~- 2.4, MOPS 10, pH 7.4; Na+-free solution (raM) Ca +÷ 0.41, Mg++ 0.82, Ba÷+ 5, TEA + 10, CI- 22.5, sucrose 140. Ouabain (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was added from a 0.2 M solution in dimethylsulfoxide for the low concentration (10 ~M) solutions, and was directly dissolved in the final solution for the 2 mM concentration. Results are expressed as mean -+ SE ( n - - n u m b e r of observations). The statistical significance of differences between means was estimated using Student's t test for unpaired data. P < 0.05 was chosen as the level of statistical significance.

RESULTS
Expression of Exogenous Na,K Pumps
Coinjection o f ~t a n d [3 subunit cRNAs r e s u l t e d in the e x p r e s s i o n o f a large exogenous Na,K-pump activity in all groups. Fig. 2 shows that the current due to exogenous Na,K pumps (i.e., the current measured after inhibition of the endogenous Na,K pump) was four to six times higher in the 0tlfllNaK and alJ33NaK groups, and about twice higher in the ~tll3HK group than the current due to the endogenous Na,K pump, i.e., the current measured in noninjected oocytes before exposure to ouabain. In noninjected oocytes no ouabain sensitive current could be detected after exposure to 10 ~M ouabain for 1 min. All the means values of the groups of cRNA-injected oocyte are significantly different from 0 (P < 0.005 in each case). In earlier experiments in which ouabain binding was measured in paralell with the activity, we have shown that the Na,K-pump current measured at -50 mV in the presence of 10 mM K ÷ was highly correlated with the number of ouabain binding sites and thus is a reliable estimate of the number of Na,K-pump expressed at the surface of the oocyte (Jaunin, Horisberger, Richter, Good, Rossier, and Geering,

610

THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY · VOLUME 103 · 1994

1992). A similar relationship between the number of ouabain binding sites and Na,K-pump current (or ouabain-sensitive rubidium uptake) was observed when cdNaK alone, al{31NaK and alI3HK were compared (Horisberger et al., 1991b). Therefore, the lower activity in the cd{3HK group can most probably be attributed to the lower level of expression, possibly due to a less efficient assembly between the amphibian Na, K-ATPase a l subunit and the mammalian H,K-ATPase {3 subunit (Horisberger et al., 1991b).

Ouabain-sensitive and Potassium-induced Currents

Fig. 3 shows the results of experiments performed in the presence of external sodium. The main source of variation in the current values was related to the level of expression of active Na,K pump. Therefore all current values were normalized to the ouabain-sensitive current measured in the presence of 10 mM K+ at - 5 0 mV (mean values indicated in Fig. 2). The upper panel shows the current sensitive to 2 mM

ouabain in the presence of 10 mM K+ (corresponding to the subtraction of the I-V curves e m i n u s f o f Fig. 1). In all groups the voltage dependence of the Na,K-pump current was marked at negative potentials ( ~ 50% decrease of the ouabain-sensitive current between - 5 0 and - 1 3 0 mV) similarly to what has been described in earlier reports in oocyte (Rakowski and Paxson, 1988; Schweigert, Lafaire, and Schwarz, 1988; Wu and Civaa, 1991) or other cell types (Horisberger and Giebisch, 1989; Rakowski, Gadsby, and De Weer, 1989; Gadsby and Nakao, 1989; Stimers, Shigeto, and Lieberman, 1990). The voltage dependence tended to be smaller at depolarized membrane potentials, especially for the endogenous pump and for the cxl{3HK group. This can be explained by the lower apparent affinity of K+ for these cx/{3 complexes in the depolarized potential range (see below). K+ concentrations higher than 10 mM could not be used because significant ouabain-resistant K+-induced currents appeared at K+ concentrations > 10 mM. The middle panel shows that currents induced by 10 mM K+ were of similar magnitude and had a similar voltage

dependence as the ouabain-sensitive current. The lower panel shows the current induced by 10 mM K+ in the presence of 2 mM ouabain (corresponding to the subtraction of the I-V curvesfminus g of Fig. I). The size of this current amounted to a few percent of the ouabain-sensitive current in the presence of 10 mM K+. For the cRNA-injected oocytes a small residual Na,K-pump current was expected because of the high KI of ouabain for the Bufo Na,K p u m p (Jaisser et al., 1992a). Assuming a KI of 50 CM and simple one-site inhibition kinetics, 2 mM ouabain should inhibit 97.6% of the total current. From these results we conclude that the K+-induced currents were essentially due to activation of the Na,K-pump.
Fig. 4 shows the results of similar measurements performed in the absence of external Na +. T h e ouabain-sensitive current (upper panel) was slightly voltage sensitive in the negative potential range (~ 20% decrease of the ouabain-sensitive current between - 5 0 and - 1 3 0 mV). Although smaller than that observed in the presence of external Na ÷, this voltage dependence was statistically significant and similar in all groups. Gadsby, Rakowski, and De Weer (1993) have shown that the external Na ÷ binding step is the main voltage-dependent step of the sodium translocating part of the pump cycle, and Rakowski, Vasilets, LaTona, and Schwarz (1991) have shown that the apparent affinity of K+ was also voltage dependent. The presence of a voltage dependence in the absence of external Na + and at saturating K+ concentration suggests that there is another voltage-dependent step in the cycle. Except for the ~I~INaK group for which the K+-induced current was voltage independent, there was a small increase of the K+-induced current in the high negative potential range. As the effect of K÷ in the presence of ouabain was negligible (lowerpanel), the discrepancy between the ouabain-sensitive current (upper panel) and the current activated by 5 mM K+ (middle panel), at negative membrane potentials, correspond to the presence of a small ouabain-sensitive inward current in the absence of external Na + and K+. A similar ouabain-sensitive current has been observed by Rakowski et al. (1991) and has been investigated in more detail by Efthymiadis, Rettinger, and Schwarz (1993). The nature of this current is unknown.

Potassium Activation of the Na,K-Pump Current in the Absence and the Presence of External Sodium
The voltage dependence of the current activated by different concentrations of K+ (corresponding to the subtraction of the I-V curves b--d minus curve a of Fig. I) in the presence and in the absence of external Na + are shown in Fig. 5. Current values were normalized to the ouabain-sensitive current measured in the presence of the highest K+ concentration at - 5 0 inV.
Potassium activation kinetics were obtained for each membrane potential value by fitting the parameters of the Hill equation (/max, Kl/~, Hill coefficient) to the K+-induced current vs K+ concentration data for each oocyte (see examples in Fig. 6). T h e Hill coefficients (n·) were in the range of 1.5-2.0 for the experiments performed in the presence of Na +, and in the range of 0.9-1.3 for the experiments in the absence of Na +. T h e r e was no obvious voltage d e p e n d e n c e of n~ obtained by parameter fitting in either case.

two remaining parameters (/max and K1/z) yielded essentially similar results concerning the Kl/2 estimates.
The voltage dependence of the K1/2of the activation of the Na,K-pump current by
external K+ is shown in Figs. 7 and 8. In the absence of external Na + (Fig. 7) the apparent K+ affinity was increasing monotonicly with the membrane potential in all groups. In the noninjected oocyte group, the voltage dependence of the Kl/2 was similar to that observed under similar conditions by Rakowski et al. (1991), with an exponential steepness factor of 0.36 +- 0.05 (n = 6). In the etl[31NaK and ctl133NaK
groups the steepness factor of the voltage dependence of KI/2 was 0.21 - 0.02
(n = 8) and 0.22 + 0.02 (n = 8), respectively (no significant difference between these two groups). Both these values were significantly smaller than in the noninjected
group (P < 0.005). Although the KI/2values were similar at high negative membrane potentials, the K1/2at + 10 mV was much higher in the noninjected grou,p (632 + 62
p,M) than in the 0tll31NaK (241 -+ 19 I~M) and etl133NaK groups (234-+ 15 IzM)
(P < 0.001). The K1/2values were similar in the 131NaK and in the [33NaK groups.
No significant difference could be established at any potential value. The etl[3HK
group had a much higher KI/2 over the whole potential range, with a voltage
dependence, k of 0.27 + 0.06 (n = 7), a value not significantly different from those of the ~tllMNaK and ctl133NaK groups.
In the presence of Na ÷ (Fig. 8), the activation by external K÷ presented a different type of voltage dependence. In all groups, both hyperpolarization and depolarization tended to decrease the apparent affinity of K+ for activation of the pump current, with a maximal apparent affinity around -50 to -30 mV. This indicates that the voltage dependence of the apparent affinity of K÷ results not only from a voltagedependent step in the binding of K+, but also from another step with a reverse voltage dependence, presumably the binding/release of external Na + (Gadsby et al., 1993). Again the etll3HK group had a higher KI/2 than the other groups. The ctl[31NaK group had a significantly lower affinity for K+ than the etl[~3NaK, (P < 0.02 or smaller for each potential value) and this difference was larger in the high negative potential range.

DISCUSSION
In this p a p e r we have extended the previous finding by us (Jaisser et al., 1992a,b) and others (Schmalzing et al., 1992; Eakle et al., 1992) that the structure of the 13 subunit has an influence on the function of the Na,K pump present at the plasma membrane, and more specifically on the apparent affinity of potassium for its external binding site. The Na,K pump is a transport system that undergoes a complex cycle with at least two conformations, one of which (the E2 conformation)

of 10 mM K÷ are plotted against the membrane potential (Vm).(Top)Current sensitive to 2 mM ouabain in the presence of 10 mM K+ (corresponding to the subtraction of current recordings f minus e of Fig. 1).

has a high affinity for external K÷ ions. The apparent affinity of K+, which we measure as the KI/2, will generally be different from the intrinsic affinity (Kin) of the E2 conformation (L~iuger, 1991). In principle, modifications of the K1/2 could result from a change of the Km as well as from other alterations in the kinetics of the p u m p cycle. T o investigate the role o f the [3 subunit in the N a , K - p u m p function, we have examined the potassium activation kinetics of Na,K-pump heterodimers including different 13 subunits u n d e r two conditions, in the presence and in the absence o f external Na +, and over a wide range o f m e m b r a n e potential.
The most striking difference between pumps including [31NaK and [33NaK isoforms was the a p p a r e n t affinity for K + measured in the presence of external Na +. No difference could be detected in the absence of external Na + over the whole potential range. In contrast, a much lower apparent affinity for K+ was observed with the al[3HK complex both in the presence and in the absence o f external Na +.
To analyze the difference of the apparent affinity for K+ and its relation to the intrinsic affinity, we have used a simple three-state kinetic model of the Na,K-pump cycle that is described in the Appendix. In this model the a p p a r e n t affinity, KI/2 is related to the intrinsic Km by the following relation (Eq. A8 in the Appendix):

fl +bl

K1/2 = Km-f~ + f 2

(3)

T h e large difference of K1/2 observed between the a l [31NaK and the a l [3HK groups was of roughly similar magnitude in the presence and in the absence of external Na +, and at all tested membrane potentials. The most simple explanation for this uniform difference u n d e r various conditions is an alteration of the intrinsic Kin, which appears as a factor in the right side of Eq. 3.
The absence of detectable difference between the c~l[31NaK and the al[33NaK g r o u p s in the absence o f external Na + makes it very unlikely that the intrinsic Km was altered. If the change of the apparent affinity observed in the presence of Na + has to be attributed to the modification of a single rate constant, an increase of the rate constant b 1 (i.e., the backward Na + translocating step) in the al133NaK group could explain both the higher Kl/z in the presence of external Na + and the absence of difference in Na+-free external solutions. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the difference of KI/2 increases at negative membrane potential. Indeed, as the rate of the backward Na + translocating step (b l) increases at negative membrane potentials, owing to the voltage dependence of external Na + binding (Gadsby et al., 1993), the influence o f b l on t h e f l + bl term increases. It is, however, obvious that more complex modifications, concerning several rate constants could also produce these results.

The 13 subunit might be involved in the function of the Na,K p u m p because the transmembrane segment of the [3 peptide chain participates directly in the structure of cation binding or occlusion sites, as suggested by Capasso, Hoving, Tal, Goldshleger, and Karlish (1992). Alternatively, the [3 subunit, by its close interaction with the c~ subunit, might modify the structure of the c~ protein a n d / o r the equilibrium between different conformational states of this subunit. Comparison of the primary sequence of a large number of [3 subunit isoforms (Horisberger et al., 1991c) indicate that the overall structure is well conserved: a short intracellular amino-terminal sequence is followed by one transmembrane segment and a large extracytoplasmic carboxy-terminal domain. A striking difference is the presence in the [31 isoform of a stretch of 15-20 amino acids (corresponding to exon 5) that is not present in the other [3 isoforms. The differences between [3HK and the other [3 isoforms are more substantial (about 30% identity) and widespread throughout the whole sequence. Studies using chimeric [3 subunits formed from different isoforms may allow us to determine more precisely which parts of the [3 protein are involved in the functional differences that we have observed, and help to delineate functional domains of the 13 subunit.
Although the presence of c~ and 133NaK subunits has been shown in Xenopus oocytes (Jaunin et al., 1992), the exact isoform composition of the protein forming active Na,K pumps at the plasma membrane of this cell type has not yet been determined. Our results obtained with noninjected oocytes show that the function of the endogenous Na,K pump is clearly different from either that of the cxl[31NaK or the cxl[33NaK complexes. In particular, the voltage dependence of the apparent affinity for K+ is nearly twice as steep for the endogenous than for the ~xl[31NaK or cd [33NaK pumps. The reasons for this difference are not clear. Species differences do not seem to be the explanation since Xenopus cd[31NaK or ~l[33NaK complexes expressed in oocytes by cRNA injection also show a higher apparent affinity for K+ when compared to endogenous Na,K-pumps studied in non injected oocytes (unpublished results). The existence of an oocyte specific ~ subunit isoform might explain the difference in K+ affinity. Deletions of the amino-terminal part of the ~ subunit have been shown to alter the apparent affinity for K+ (B/Jrgener-Kairuz, Horisberger, Geering, and Rossier, 1991), and more specifically the voltage dependence of the apparent K+ affinity (Vasilets, Omay, Ohta, Noguchi, Kawamura, and Schwarz, 1991). The importance of the amino terminus is further suggested by the presence of a distinct transcript of the ~1 isoform in the oocyte and during early development (Bfirgener-Kairuz, personal communication).
In conclusion, our results point to an important role of the [3 subunit in the

A T P a s e 133 s u b u n i t i n d u c e s a d e c r e a s e o f t h e a p p a r e n t affinity t h a t is m o s t likely d u e to alterations of the Na + translocation kinetics rather than to a direct alteration of the K + binding site.

APPENDIX
To analyze the relation between the intrinsic affinity (Kin) and the apparent activation constant (Ki/2), we used a simple steady-state kinetic model of the Na, K-pump cycle. As illustrated in Fig. 9, this model includes three states: El, E2, and E2K. An equilibrium binding kinetic with an intrinsic affinity K,, links the E2 and E2K states. The pseudomonomolecular rate constantsfl and bl represent the step during which, according to the Post-Albers model, Na + ions are released (forward: fl) or bound (backward: bl). The f2 rate constant summarizes all the other steps of the cycle between the E2K and the E1 state. The backward rate constant of the E2K to E 1 step is assumed to be slow compared to the other rate constants and is set to 0. The bI rate constant is equal to 0 in the absence of external Na + and has a finite value in the presence of Na +. From published data (Rakowski et al., 1991; Gadsby et al., 1993), b o t h bl and Km are expected to be voltage dependent. The observed voltage dependence of the ouabain-sensitive current in the absence of external Na ÷ (Fig. 3, top) suggests that e i t h e r f l or f 2 are also voltage dependent. It should be noticed that the E1 and E2 states do not have exactly the same meaning as they do in the Post-Albers model.

ABSTRACT
Purpose: This study investigated whether the metabolic avidity of primary tumors and/ or metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) measured by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was related to survival after surgery in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Materials and Methods: One hundred sixty-eight patients with AGC who underwent preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT and curative resection were included. The 18F-FDG avidity of the primary gastric tumor and LNs was determined quantitatively and qualitatively. The diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG PET/CT was calculated, and the prognostic significance of 18F-FDG avidity for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed. Results: In all, 51 (30.4%) patients experienced recurrence, and 32 (19.0%) died during follow-up (median follow-up duration, 35 months; range, 3-81 months); 119 (70.8%) and 33 (19.6%) patients showed 18F-FDG-avid primary tumors and LNs, respectively. 18F-FDG PET/ CT showed high sensitivity (73.8%) for the detection of advanced pathologic T (pT 3) stage and high specificity (92.2%) for the detection of advanced pN (2) stage. 18F-FDG avidity of LNs was significantly associated with RFS (P=0.012), whereas that of primary tumors did not show significance (P=0.532). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that 18F-FDG avidity of LNs was an independent prognostic factor for RFS (hazard ratio=2.068; P=0.029). Conclusions: 18F-FDG avidity of LNs is an independent prognostic factor for predicting RFS. Preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT can be used to determine the risk and prognosis of patients with AGC after curative resection.

INTRODUCTION
Advanced gastric cancer (AGC) is one of the most common malignancies resulting in cancerrelated deaths in Asian populations [1-3]. Radical surgery is the standard treatment option for patients with resectable disease; however, the prognosis remains poor with a 5-year survival of approximately 30% [3]. Recurrence after curative surgery often occurs in 12%-54% of cases and is the main cause of cancer-related death [4]. Hence, stratifying the patient's risk

and prediction of prognosis are key issues in the postoperative management of AGC patients. The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification system by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has been used to predict patients' prognoses. However, the conventional clinicopathological approach does not adequately represent the complexity of gastric cancer biology [5,6].
Current guidelines for staging AGC include gastrofiberscopy; contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis; and laparoscopy. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is preferred to evaluate metastatic disease [7,8]. 18F-FDG PET/CT has been shown to be useful in AGC patients in many aspects. 18F-FDG PET/CT can determine the operability of locally advanced gastric cancer [9] and facilitate the detection of recurrence during follow-up after surgery [10,11]. Several studies have shown the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET/CT for the prognosis of AGC patients undergoing chemotherapy [12,13]. However, the independent role of preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT in AGC still needs to be investigated.

Lymph node (LN) metastasis is a substantial factor in the staging and prognosis of patients with AGC [14]. Although 18F-FDG PET/CT has low diagnostic sensitivity for LN metastasis, evaluation of LN metabolism can be useful to predict prognosis [15]. The advantage of 18F-FDG PET/CT is the simultaneous assessment and comparison of metabolism in primary tumors and metastatic LNs, which provide prognostic information [16,17]. A comprehensive evaluation of the metabolic aggressiveness of metastatic LNs in the preoperative setting can be used as a potential biomarker in AGC.

In this study, we evaluated the metabolic characteristics of primary tumors and/or metastatic LNs and compared them with survival data after surgery in patients with AGC to determine the clinical impact of preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We analyzed the medical records of consecutive AGC patients in our hospital between July 2010 and December 2014. Among them, 168 patients with AGC who underwent curative surgical resection were enrolled in this study. The inclusion criteria were: 1) initial diagnosis of gastric cancer, 2) preoperative staging with 18F-FDG PET/CT in our hospital, 3) pathologic staging of T2-T4, and 4) a histological type of common epithelial tumor according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association system [18]. The exclusion criteria were: 1) early gastric cancers, 2) double primary malignancies, 3) distant organ metastasis, 4) loss to followup within 3 months after surgery, and 5) treatment with palliative/non-curative surgery. Patients' clinical and histopathologic characteristics analyzed in this study were acquired prospectively at the time of surgery. The Institutional Review Board of our hospital approved this retrospective clinical study (AN17196-001), and the requirement for informed consent was waived. All procedures performed in this study involving human participants were in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.
All patients underwent total or subtotal gastrectomy according to the anatomic location of the primary tumor, accompanied by lymphadenectomy according to the General Rules

for Gastric Cancer [18]. Curative resection was defined by the complete absence of visible tumor tissue with negative margins. In cases of subtotal gastrectomy, tumor-free margins of >3 cm and 5 cm were obtained in patients with well-marginated and infiltrative primary tumors, respectively. Histopathologic classification of the primary tumors included subtype (signet ring cell vs. non-signet ring cell, which included adenocarcinoma with papillary, tubular, poorly differentiated, and mucinous subtypes), Lauren classification (intestinal vs. non-intestinal, which included diffuse and mixed types), and Bormann classification. After surgery, patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy based on their histopathologic results and performance status. Subsequently, patients were regularly followed using serum tumor markers, gastrofiberscopy, and/or CECT.
18F-FDG PET/CT
18F-FDG PET/CT was performed using a dedicated scanner (Gemini TF 16, Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA, USA). Patients fasted for 6 hours, and blood glucose level was <200 mg/dL at the time of 18F-FDG injection. PET/CT image acquisition was performed 60 minutes after the administration of 18F-FDG (approximately 5.18 MBq/kg). A low-dose CT scan was acquired for attenuation correction (50 mA, 120 kVp, slice thickness 4 mm, matrix size 512×512). Emission PET images were acquired for 1 minute in each bed position. PET images were reconstructed using a 3-dimensional iterative algorithm (row action maximum likelihood algorithm) with TOF function (3 iterations, 33 subsets, matrix size 144×144).
Image analysis
All 18F-FDG PET/CT images were reviewed by 2 experienced nuclear medicine physicians in consensus. 18F-FDG avidity for both primary tumors and LNs were determined using quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative parameters included the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and the LN-totumor ratio (LTR). The SUVmax of the lesion was measured in volume of interest (VOI). VOI of the primary tumor was determined from the hottest point in the lesion in transaxial PET/CT images. In the case of a non-discernible primary lesion on PET/CT, VOI was drawn on the stomach wall according to the tumor location based on CECT and gastrofiberscopy. SUV was calculated as (radioactivity [kBq] per unit volume [mL]/injected 18F-FDG activity [kBq] per body mass [g]). The MTV was defined as the volume (cm3) within the VOI. The TLG was calculated as the product of the MTV and mean SUV within the VOI. The ratio of the SUVmax of the LTR was calculated. The LTR in non-discernible LNs was calculated by coding the SUVmax of the LNs as 1. All image analyses were performed using a dedicated workstation (Extended Brilliance Workspace 4.0, Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
Criteria for determining 18F-FDG avidity for both primary tumors and LNs were defined as 1) focally increased 18F-FDG uptake by visual analysis and 2) a reasonable isocontouring result of MTV with a cutoff value of 50% of the SUVmax (Fig. 1).
Clinicopathologic and survival data
Clinical data obtained from medical records included age at surgery, sex, preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), histopathologic results, and pathologic T (pT) and N (pN) staging. Pathologic staging was based on the 7th edition of the AJCC System. Recurrencefree survival (RFS) was defined as the interval from the date of surgery to the date of crosssectional imaging when recurrence (by pathologic confirmation or clinical decision) was first noted. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval from the date of surgery to the date of the last hospital visit.

Fig. 1. Representative cases of 18F-FDG-avid primary tumor (A, left) and LNs (A, right), non-avid primary tumor (B), and non-avid LN (C). The metabolic tumor volume of the primary tumor and LNs in the patient (A) was 18.8 cm3 and 0.2 cm3, respectively (yellow arrow: primary tumor, red arrow: LN). 18F-FDG = 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose; LN = lymph node.
Statistical analyses
Numeric data were represented as the mean±standard deviation. Differences among variables between groups were compared using Student's t-test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the 2 test. Diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG avidity for detecting primary tumors and metastatic LNs was evaluated by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Survival time was estimated using the log-rank test. Univariate Cox regression analysis was performed for evaluating the statistical significance of clinicopathologic parameters. Continuous variables were analyzed directly or dichotomized using the optimal cutoff value by receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of LN-related parameters on other significant parameters. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistics software (version 18.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

TNM staging, tumor size, and the presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were significantly different according to recurrence (P<0.05). For histopathologic results, the frequency of signet ring cell-type was not significantly different according to recurrence (P=0.288). The frequency of intestinal-type was higher in the non-recurring group (P=0.003). However, the Bormann classification results did not vary significantly in terms of recurrence (P=0.062).
18F-FDG avidity of tumor lesions: diagnostic evaluation
We detected 18F-FDG-avid primary tumors in 119 (70.8%) patients. However, the presence of 18F-FDG-avid primary tumors was not significantly different between patients with (n=37, 72.5%) and without (n=82, 70.1%) recurrence (P=0.747). The SUVmax, MTV, and TLG values of 18F-FDG-avid primary tumors showed no significant difference according to recurrence (P=0.561, 0.551, and 0.800, respectively). The SUVmax of all primary tumors (including non-avid tumors) also showed no difference between patients with and without recurrence (5.73±4.26 vs. 5.75±5.08; P=0.979). We found that 33 (19.6%) patients showed more than one 18F-FDG-avid LN on 18F-FDG PET/CT. 18F-FDG-avid LNs tended to be more frequent in recurring cases (n=14, 27.5%) than in non-recurring cases (n=19, 16.2%; P=0.093).

to primary tumors, the SUVmax, MTV, and TLG values of 18F-FDG-avid LNs were not different between patients with and without recurrence (P=0.854, 0.864, and 0.661, respectively). The calculated LTR was also not significantly different between patients with and without recurrence (0.38±0.26 vs. 0.36±0.29; P=0.749).
The diagnostic evaluation of 18F-FDG PET/CT for high T stage (pT 3-4) primary tumors showed a sensitivity of 73.8%, a specificity of 38.1%, a PPV of 78.2%, and an NPV of 32.7% (Table 2). For the detection of high N stage (pN 2-3), the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 18F-FDG PET/CT were 29.7%, 92.2%, 81.8%, and 52.6%, respectively. For the detection of metastatic LNs (pN 1-3), the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 18F-FDG PET/CT were 26.2%, 97.8%, 97.0%, and 33.3%, respectively (Table 3).
Prognostic factors for RFS and OS
The median RFS and OS were 34.9 and 36.5 months, respectively. The significance of 18F-FDG avidity for recurrence was evaluated (Fig. 2). The 18F-FDG avidity of primary tumors was not significantly correlated with RFS or OS (P=0.532 and 0.658, respectively). However, the 18F-FDG avidity of LNs showed significant correlation with a shorter RFS (P=0.012). The mean RFS of patients with 18F-FDG-avid LNs was 36.5±4.5 months, whereas that of patients with non-avid LNs was 60.4±2.7 months. The relationship between 18F-FDG avidity of LNs and OS did not show statistical significance (P=0.181).

LN FDG Avidity in AGC Patients

Univariate analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic significance of the clinicopathologic parameters (Table 4). Age and sex were not correlated with patients' survival. The size of the primary tumor and the number of metastatic LNs proven histopathologically were significantly correlated with both RFS and OS (P0.001). High pT (3) and pN (2) stages were also significantly correlated with patients' survival. The histopathologic subtype of signet ring cell cancer was a prognostic factor for OS (P=0.044), but not for RFS (P=0.377). Non-intestinal subtype and LVI were significant prognostic factors for both RFS and OS. Preoperative CEA level was not related to RFS (P=0.536) and OS (P=0.351). 18F-FDG avidity of primary tumors was not correlated with RFS and OS, but 18F-FDG avidity of LNs was a significant prognostic factor for RFS (P=0.015). The correlation between 18F-FDG avidity of LNs and OS was not significant (P=0.187). Other 18F-FDG-PET/CT-driven parameters, including the SUVmax of primary tumors and the LTR, were not significantly correlated with patients' survival.
Construction of the multivariate survival models was based on significant parameters driven from univariate analysis, and metastatic LN-related parameters were combined to compare the effect in each model: 1) Model with 18F-FDG avidity of LNs, 2) Model with number of metastatic LNs, and 3) Model with pN stage (2) (Tables 5 and 6). For RFS, the size of the primary tumor was an independent prognostic factor in all models (Table 5). Non-intestinal subtype and LVI were independent factors in models 1 and 2, but significance was not observed in model 3. 18F-FDG avidity of LNs was an independent prognostic factor for predicting RFS. For OS, the size of the primary tumor was an independent prognostic factor in all models (Table 6).

Other histopathologic factors did not show statistical significance. Among the LN-related parameters, only pN stage was an independent factor for predicting OS.
Subgroup analysis was performed for patients with histopathologically proven adenocarcinoma (n=154), and histologic grade of the primary tumor was added in the survival analysis. As in the total patient population, tumor size, number of metastatic LNs, pathologic staging, and LVI showed significance for predicting RFS and OS (Supplementary Table 1). Poorly differentiated subtype was a significant prognostic factor for RFS (P=0.005) but not for OS (P=0.175). Lauren nonintestinal subtype was also a significant factor for RFS (P=0.001) but not for OS (P=0.137). The 18F-FDG avidity of LNs was a significant factor for RFS in the univariate analysis (P=0.031) but not in the multivariate analysis (P=0.120, Supplementary Table 2).

DISCUSSION
This study evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic value of preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with resectable AGC. Current evidence suggests that primary tumor resection and standardized D2 lymphadenectomy under best post-operative care lower recurrence, death rate, and morbidity/mortality [19]. Standardized preoperative workup is recommended to evaluate the disease status based on patient examination, laboratory profile, endoscopy procedure, and CECT [7]. However, the 5-year survival rate after curative resection remains disappointing. Randomized clinical trials have reported varying results for adjuvant chemotherapy according to regional differences [20,21]. These findings suggest the heterogeneous biology of gastric cancer and the need for effective prognostic biomarkers for AGC patients [22]. Evaluation of tumor metabolism by 18F-FDG PET/CT may play a potential role as a surrogate marker of tumor aggressiveness, which is correlated with patients' prognoses.
The diagnosis of LN metastasis is one of the most important prognostic factors in AGC patients after curative surgery [23]. LN metastasis predicts accurate and stage-specific survival in the subclassification of patients with a similar pT stage [24]. The number of metastatic LNs is directly correlated with survival time [25]. Hence, a comprehensive analysis of LN metastasis is needed to evaluate AGC patients, especially those contemplating curative surgery. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed a high predictive value (approximately 92.6%) for node-negative, early gastric cancer but played a limited role in predicting extra-perigastric LN metastasis [26,27]. CECT has been widely used for the evaluation of the degree of LN metastasis; however, the size criteria for determining LN metastasis often have limited sensitivity and yield false-negative results [28]. The diagnostic accuracy of preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT for LN metastasis in patients with AGC has long been discussed. The

225

LN FDG Avidity in AGC Patients

diagnostic sensitivity for metastasis of N1 LNs was below 50%, which was lower than for CECT. However, 18F-FDG PET/CT outperformed CECT for the specificity of N staging. Especially in advanced N stage, the specificity by 18F-FDG PET/CT was 96% and 99% in N2 and N3 lymph nodes, respectively [29-31]. In view of resectability, accurate staging of advanced disease is essential for planning the surgical approach and extent of en bloc resection. This study also showed comparable accuracy with high specificity (92.2%) for the diagnosis of advanced N stage, although 18F-FDG avidity of LNs was determined by combining qualitative and quantitative criteria. We suggest that the diagnostic value of 18F-FDG PET/CT might be related directly with prognostic information to determine patients' survival.
Until now, a few studies have reported the correlation between 18F-FDG uptake by LNs and the prognoses of patients with AGC. A recent study revealed that a high SUVmax of LNs is an independent factor for patients' RFS and OS [15]. Metabolic information for LNs was correlated with patients' OS, whereas the size of lymphadenopathies did not show a significant relationship. Additionally, 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed metastatic disease that was not detected on CT [32]. In this study, the 18F-FDG avidity of LNs in patients with AGC was significantly correlated with disease recurrence as well as other histopathologic parameters for determining metastatic LNs. Patients with non-avid LNs had a 2-year RFS rate of 82.2% (111/135), whereas patients with 18F-FDG-avid LNs showed a 2-year RFS rate of 60.6% (20/33). The mean difference in RFS according to the 18F-FDG avidity of LNs was approximately 24 months. The results suggest the need for revisiting the role of preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT for accurate prediction of recurrence in patients with AGC.
Studies for evaluating the utility of 18F-FDG PET/CT in AGC focused on 18F-FDG uptake by primary tumors. High 18F-FDG uptake by primary tumors was associated with 2-year RFS after curative resection [33,34]. In this study, the 18F-FDG avidity of primary tumors was not significantly correlated with recurrence. 18F-FDG uptake by primary tumors is partly affected by background gastric wall activity and histopathologic subtype [35]. Furthermore, several parameters for measuring 18F-FDG uptake by primary tumors have been proposed, including SUVmax, MTV, and tumor-to-liver ratio [11,36]. Further studies for optimizing 18F-FDG PET/ CT-driven parameters are needed to investigate the correlation between glucose metabolism in gastric cancer and patients' prognoses. In the present study, the 18F-FDG avidity of LNs was determined dichotomously instead of using continuous SUVmax values. The SUVmax of small perigastric LNs is often hard to standardize because of the partial-volume effect and spillover effect [37]. 18F-FDG avidity of LNs used in this study had high specificity for determining nodal metastases and represents an independent prognostic factor for RFS.
This study has several limitations. First, the 18F-FDG avidity of LNs was correlated with patients' RFS but not with OS, probably due to the relatively small sample and event size. Second, the prognosis-predicting model in this study was not entirely based on pre-operative clinical parameters. Further studies are needed to evaluate the significance of preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT in terms of clinical staging. Finally, this retrospective single-center study might be inevitably associated with a patient selection bias.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that 18F-FDG avidity of LNs evaluated by PET/CT scan is an independent factor contributing to RFS following curative resection in patients with AGC. We suggest that preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT should be used for predicting prognosis aimed at appropriate risk monitoring of AGC patients during follow-up after surgery.

Comparative evaluation of metalceramic bond strengths of nickel chromium and cobalt chromium alloys on repeated castings: An in vitro study. J Int Oral Health 2014;6(5):99-103. Abstract: Background: Recasting the base metal alloys is done as a routine procedure in the dental laboratories whenever there is casting failure or to decrease the unit cost of a fixed partial denture. However, this procedure may affect the metal ceramic bond. Furthermore, it is unclear, as to which test closely predicts the bond strength of metal-ceramic interface. The aim was to compare the bond strength of nickel chromium (Ni-Cr) and cobalt chromium (Co-Cr) alloys with dental ceramic on repeated castings using shear bond test with a custom made apparatus. Materials and Methods: Sixty metal ceramic samples were prepared using Wiron 99 and Wirobond C, respectively. Three subgroups were prepared for each of the groups. The first subgroup was prepared by casting 100% fresh alloy. The second and third subgroups were prepared by adding 50% of fresh alloy and the remnants of the previous cast alloy. The bond load (N) between alloy and dental porcelain was evaluated using universal testing machine using a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min, which had a 2500kgf load cell. Mean values were compared using oneway analysis of variance with post-hoc Tukey's test and Student's t-test. Results: The mean shear bond load of A0 (842.10N) was significantly higher than the load of A1 (645.50N) and A2 (506.28N). The mean shear bond load of B0 (645.57N) was significantly higher than the load of B1 (457.35N) and B2 (389.30N).

Conclusions: Significant reduction in the bond strength was observed with the addition of the first recast alloy (A1 and B1) compared with the addition of second recast alloy (A2 and B2). NiCr alloys (664.63N) showed higher bond strengths compared to that of Co-Cr alloys (497.41N). The addition of previously used base metal dental alloy for fabricating metal ceramic restorations is not recommended.

Introduction Base metal dental alloys are often used as alternatives to precious alloys due their cost considerations, mechanical properties, and low density.1,2 Currently, there is growing concern about nickel (Ni) being an allergen and beryllium (Be) being a toxic element.3,4 Therefore, cobalt chromium (Co-Cr) alloys may serve as an alternative to nickel chromium (Ni-Cr) alloys, due to the allergic concerns of Ni and Be.5-7 Remelting the casted metal is usually done whenever there is a casting failure or as a routine procedure where dental laboratories want to decrease the unit cost of a fixed partial denture.
Hong et al. studied the effect of various percentages of reused silver-palladium alloy on the bond strength of porcelain and concluded that, 50% new alloy should be added to each casting button.8 de Melo et al. evaluated the shear bond strength between a porcelain system and 4 alternative alloys (2 Ni-Cr alloys and 2 Co-Cr alloys) and reported bond strength values ranging between 54 MPa and 71.7 MPa.9
However, none of these studies compared the effects of recasting on the bond strength of porcelain to both the Ni-Cr and Co-Cr alloys. Furthermore, it is unclear from the literature, as to which bond strength test closely predicts the bond strength of metal-ceramic interface. Therefore, this study was designed to compare the bond strength of Ni-Cr and Co-Cr alloys with dental ceramic on repeated castings using shear bond test with a custom made apparatus.
Materials and Methods The Ni-Cr alloy used in this prospective study was Wiron 99 (BEGO Ltd., Germany) composed of Ni 65, Cr 22.5, Mo 9.5, Nb 1, Si 1, Fe 0.5, Ce 0.5 and C max. 0.02. The Co-Cr alloy used was Wirobond C (BEGO Ltd., Germany)

composed of Co 61, Cr 26, W 5, Nb 1, Si 1, Fe 0.5, Ce 0.5 and C maximum 0.02 (in % by Wt.). These alloy brands were selected for the study due to their biocompatibility, long-term clinical usage and reliable processing methods. Ethical clearance from the institutional review board was obtained for the study. A rod with a length and diameter of 5 mm was machined to the sample dimensions used by de Melo et al. to prepare a metal die9 (Figure 1). The machined die was embedded in a putty silicone impression material (polyvinyl siloxane, aquasil soft putty, dentsply) to prepare a silicone index. Casting wax (thowax, yeti dental) was used to prepare the wax duplicates. All the wax duplicates were then sprued and invested in a phosphate bonded investment material (Bellasun, Bego) (Figure 2). Lost wax technique was followed, and samples were cast using centrifugal casting machine (OKAY PLUS, Galoni, Italy). After casting, samples were devested and sandblasted (Renfert, Basic master, TBS Pvt. Ltd). Metal samples that are free of voids and meeting the specimen dimensions were only considered for porcelain application. Following the manufacturer's recommendations, opaque porcelain was applied to a clean metal surface using a brush. Dentine porcelain (VMK 95 Metal Ceramic; VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany) was condensed into the putty index, which was used to standardize the porcelain thickness (Figure 3). The samples were removed from the index and fired in a porcelain furnace (Vacumat 40, VITA Zahnfabrik, Germany) (Figure 4). Sample size (n = 10) was determined from similar studies on metal ceramic bond and to get significant values.9-12 Sixty metal-ceramic samples were prepared out of which thirty samples were cast using Wiron 99, which constituted the Group A and the rest were casted using Wirobond C, which constituted the Group B. Three subgroups were prepared for each of the above groups. The subgroups A0 and B0 were prepared by casting 100% fresh alloy and served as the controls for both the A and B groups, respectively. The subgroups A1 and B1 were prepared by adding 50% of fresh alloy and the remnants of the already cast alloy of A0 and B0, respectively. The subgroups A2 and B2 were prepared by adding 50% of fresh alloy and remnants of their cast alloy of A1 and B1, respectively. The study design is depicted in Table 1.
To measure the mechanical shear bond test, a custom made apparatus made of steel was specially designed for the purpose of the study. This apparatus is made up of two independent pieces. The first Part A is a flat cylindrical shape to fit into the second Part B (Figure 1). The second part, also cylindrical used as a piston during mechanical evaluation. 4 mm diameter perforations are present for proper seating of both parts together. In Part A, the metallic component is lodged and the ceramic portion in Part B. The set was placed in a universal testing machine and on the upper cylindrical prolongation of Part B. Using a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min, the shear bond test was conducted in Instron Universal testing machine

(Instron 3366, Norwood, USA), which had a 2500-kgf load cell (Figure 5) and porcelain fracture for minimum load was recorded for each sample. Statistical analysis Subgroup was the independent variable, and measured strength was the dependent variable for both the groups. One-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey multiple comparison test was used for statistical analysis of the data ( = 0.01). An alpha level of 0.01 rather than the more traditional 0.05 was selected to decrease the Type 1 error rate. A statistical software package (SPSS 15.0; SPSS, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for the analysis. Results Shear bond load between cast alloys and dental porcelain was compared among the groups. The mean shear bond load of Ni-Cr (664.63N) was significantly higher than the load of

Discussion This study was carried out to compare the bond strength of Ni-Cr and Co-Cr alloys with dental ceramic on repeated castings using shear bond test with custom made apparatus. Studies showed that the bond strength of ceramic to Co-Cr and Ni-Cr alloys ranges from 35 to 95 MPa.13,14 The bond strength values obtained in this study for the Ni-Cr alloys were consistent with those of previous studies.10-12,15,16 The findings of the present study showed that there was significant reduction in the metal-ceramic bond strength for each of the Ni-Cr (664.63N) and Co-Cr alloys (497.41N) with the addition of recast alloy to the fresh alloy.

This reduction in the bond strength can be attributed to an increase in the frequency of interfacial voids as the percentage of recast metal is increased. Another possible reason for the failure of recast alloy may be the compositional change that occurs after multiple castings.17 This results in a decreased bond between the metal and the ceramic, since the chemical bond is affected by these elements. Tucillo reported that the thickness of the adherent oxide layer formed at the metal surface might decline due to multiple castings, and result in decreased bond strength.18
Several tests were reported in the literature which evaluated the metal-ceramic bond strength, such as twist, shear, tension, flexural mode or the combination of flexural and twist modes all showing advantages and disadvantages.7 The shear test is considered by some authors as the most adequate method to measure bond between two materials.10,19-22 The dominant stress in the shear bond test is shear stress, whereas in the 3-point bending test; tensile stress predominates.19 Therefore, in the present study shear bond was tested using the universal testing machine to evaluate the bond at the metal ceramic interface. In this study, a custom made apparatus was devised so as to concentrate the load predominantly on the metal-ceramic interface and achieve accurate interfacial shear bond results.
When high gold alloys are used, the addition of up to 50% remnant alloy from previous castings is acceptable. However, results from the current study suggest that the addition of previously cast alloy should be avoided if base metal dental alloy is selected for metal ceramic restorations. A significant decrease in the metal ceramic bond after the addition of recast alloy is confirmed with the shear bond test citing to be of the reasons for the clinical fractures observed on metal ceramic

restorations. Considering the decreased cost of base metal dental alloys, when compared to noble and high noble alloy alternatives, the addition of previously used alloy is not crucial and should be avoided.
Further studies should be conducted to evaluate the effect of multiple firings on the metal-ceramic bond strength and the

variation of bond strength with thermocycling of the samples. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the dental alloys used is also altered after multiple castings.23 Additional researches is needed to evaluate the changes in CTE after multiple castings and cytotoxicity of base metal alloys.24 Also, other key structural factors such as grain size, porosity, and oxide thickness need further studies using scanning electron microscopy.
Conclusion Within the limitations of the present study, the following can be concluded that Ni-Cr alloys (664.63N) showed higher bond strengths than that of Co-Cr alloys (497.41N). Significant reduction in the bond strength was observed with the addition of the first recast alloy (A1 and B1) compared with the addition of second recast alloy (A2 and B2). The addition of previously used base metal dental alloy for fabricating metal ceramic restorations is not recommended.

Metastasis to the primary thyroid carcinoma is extremely rare. We report here a case of colonic adenocarcinoma metastasis to medullary thyroid carcinoma in a 53-yr old man with a history of colon cancer. He showed a nodular lesion, suggesting malignancy in the thyroid gland, in a follow-up examination after colon cancer surgery. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the thyroid gland showed tumor cell clusters, which was suspected to be medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). The patient underwent a total thyroidectomy. Using several specific immunohistochemical stains, the patient was diagnosed with colonic adenocarcinoma metastasis to MTC. To the best of our knowledge, the present patient is the first case of colonic adenocarcinoma metastasizing to MTC. Although tumor-tumor metastasis to primary thyroid carcinoma is very rare, we still should consider metastasis to the thyroid gland, when a patient with a history of other malignancy presents with a new thyroid finding.

INTRODUCTION
Although the prevalence of metastases to the thyroid gland is variable in previous reports, metastasis to the thyroid gland is known to be an uncommon condition. Moreover, metastasis to primary thyroid carcinoma is extremely rare. Fourteen cases of metastatic tumor to the primary thyroid carcinoma have been reported previously in the literature. The majority of reported primary thyroid carcinomas were papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), including follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) (1-11). To our knowledge, there has been no reported case of a tumor metastasizing to medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). We report a case of tumor-to-tumor metastasis involving metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma.
CASE DESCRIPTION
A 53-yr old man underwent an anterior resection of his cancerous sigmoid colon and adjuvant chemotherapy on November 14, 2005. About one year after surgery, a fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography integrated with computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) scan showed focal hypermetabolism in the right lobe of the thyroid gland (standard-

ized uptake value, [SUV] 4) and pulmonary nodules in the right lung, suggesting hematogenous metastatic lesions. He received chemotherapy as palliative treatment. Two years later, a PET scan still revealed a nodule, showing focal activity in the thyroid gland (SUV 2.5) (Fig. 1A). A thyroid gland ultrasonography show­ ed a marked hypoechoic solid nodule with a lobulated margin and inner microcalcification in the right mid pole, suggesting malignancy (Fig. 1B). The patient underwent ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the thyroid nodule. FNAB showed tumor cell clusters, which were suspected to be MTC. Serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were mildly elevated (17.3 pg/mL (reference range: 0-10 pg/mL) for calcitonin; 29.31 ng/mL (reference range: 0-4.7 ng/ mL) for CEA. Thyroid stimulating hormone was 2.47 IU/mL (0.25-4.0 IU/mL), thyroglobulin antigens were 9.96 ng/mL (035 ng/mL), antithyroglobulin antibodies were 0.19 IU/mL (00.3 IU/mL). The serum level of intact parathyroid hormone was 40.83 pg/mL (15-65 pg/mL). The 24-hr urine cortisol/metane­ phrine/cathecholamin levels were within the normal range. Rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene mutations were not detected. Subsequently, the patient underwent a total thyroidectomy and bilateral central neck dissection.  On gross examination, the capsule of the right lobe of thyroid was intact, smooth, and the surface was irregularly bosselated.

DISCUSSION
While the coincident occurrence of multiple primary malignant tumors in the same host is not unusual, tumor-to-tumor metastasis is a rare phenomenon. Berent (12) first documented this phenomenon in 1902. Campbell et al. (13), proposed criteria for the diagnosis of tumor-to-tumor metastasis; 1) the presence of more than one primary malignant tumor must be proved, 2) the recipient tumor must be a true neoplasm, and 3) the donor malignant tumor must be a true metastasis, with establish­ ed growth and invasion in the tumor. Direct contiguous growth of one tumor into another adjacent tumor (collision tumor), embolism of tumor cells, and metastasis to leukemic nodes are not defined as metastases. Our case satisfies the Campbell's criteria.  Previous studies reported the prevalence of metastases to the thyroid gland varied greatly (14-17). However, the previous stu­ dies included preexisting or coexisting thyroid conditions, such as benign thyroid diseases (goiter and adenoma), and primary thyroid neoplasms. Cases involving metastasis to primary thyroid carcinoma only, have a prevalence rate estimated to be less than 1%, and only 14 cases have been reported in the literature (Table 2). Rosai (3) reported the first documented case of metastatic breast carcinoma to a papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in 1992. The most commonly reported non-thyroid malignancies to metastasize to the thyroid gland are renal cell carcinoma and lung cancer (18). Colorectal carcinoma was an uncommon donor, accounting for only two of the cases (2, 4).  Willis (19) proposed a hypothesis for why the thyroid gland receives few metastatic deposits despite its rich blood supply. According to the Willis hypothesis, fast arterial flow through the thyroid and the high oxygen saturation and iodine content of the thyroid gland prevent of metastatic tumor survival in the thyroid (19). Due to the rarity and complexity of tumor metastasis, the mechanisms of metastasis to thyroid neoplasm are unclear. Some views suggested that the thyroid tumor makes an environment in which metastatic tumor cells can easily grow

by altering the normal thyroid structure as stated above (20).  MTC originates from the parafollicular C cells, which produce the hormone calcitonin. MTC is a relatively rare type of primary thyroid carcinoma, accounting for only about 5% of all thyroid carcinomas. The majority of previously reported recipient primary thyroid carcinomas were PTC, including FVPTC (12 among 14 cases) (1-3, 5-7, 9, 11). The other two cases were oncocytic/hurthle cell carcinomas (4, 8). As far as we know, cases of metastatic tumor to MTC have not been reported previously.  FNAB diagnosis of both primary thyroid malignancy and non-thyroid malignancies metastasizing to the thyroid gland at the same time is difficult and often incorrect (18). In most cases, FNAB can diagnose primary thyroid carcinoma but not the metastases to the thyroid. In the present case, FNAB allowed us to diagnose MTC, but we did not find the colorectal cancer with the technique. After surgical resection of the thyroid gland and several specific stains, we were able to diagnose the tumor-totumor metastasis (MTC and colorectal cancer). Although tumor-to-tumor metastasis to the primary thyroid carcinoma is very rare, metastasis to the thyroid gland should be considered, when a patient with history of other malignancies presents with a new thyroid finding.  In this case, although the patient already had pulmonary metastasis of colonic adenocarcinoma, he underwent surgical treatment. The prognosis of the patient was determined by the coexisting advanced colon cancer.  In conclusion, metastasis to the primary thyroid carcinoma is extremely rare. The present patient is the first example of colonic adenocarcinoma metastasizing to medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.

Right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) occurs predominantly in intravenous drug users in western countries, and it has a relatively good prognosis. Clinical features and prognosis of RIE occurring in non-drug users are not well known. We investigated the clinical findings of RIE in non-drug users. We retrospectively reviewed 345 cases diagnosed with IE. Cases with RIE or left-sided infective endocarditis (LIE) defined by the vegetation site were included and cases having no vegetation or both-side vegetation were excluded. Clinical findings and in-hospital outcome of RIE were compared to those of LIE. Among the 245 cases, 39 (16%) cases had RIE and 206 (84%) cases had LIE. RIE patients were younger (40 ± 19 yr vs 50 ± 18 yr, P = 0.004), and had a higher incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD) (36% vs 13%, P < 0.001) and central venous catheter (CVC) (21% vs 4%, P = 0.001) compared to LIE patients. A large vegetation was more common in RIE (33% vs 9%, P < 0.001). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause of RIE, while Streptococcus viridans were the most common cause of LIE. In-hospital mortality and cardiac surgery were not different between the two groups. CHD and use of CVC were common in non-drug users with RIE. The short-term clinical outcome of RIE is not different from that of LIE.

INTRODUCTION
Right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) is far less common than left-sided infective endocarditis (LIE) accounting for 5%-10% of all cases of infective endocarditis (IE) (1). In western countries, RIE occurs predominantly in intravenous drug users (IDUs) although patients with pacemakers, central venous catheters (CVC), and congenital heart disease (CHD) are at risk for RIE (2, 3). In previous studies, the proportion of IDUs among patients with RIE varied significantly from 46% to 86% (4-6).  Many studies have documented the clinical and echocardiographic features of RIE occurring in IDUs (2, 4-11). RIE in IDUs has been reported to have a better prognosis than LIE in IDUs with an in-hospital mortality of 0% and 7%, respectively (2, 8). One of the studies reported that between 40% and 90% of IDUs with IE are HIV infected, and IDUs with IE and human immunodeficiency virus infection had a higher total mortality compared IDUs with IE and without HIV infection (11). Panidis et al. reported that 55% to 65% of RIE in non-drug users were caused by Streptococcus viridans, whereas Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant cause of RIE in drug users (12). Considering the difference in co-morbidity or etiology of IE between IDUs and non-drug users, clinical features and prognosis of RIE in

non-drug users would be different from those of RIE in IDUs.  However, there are no studies on RIE in non-drug users without HIV infection. There are only case reports of tricuspid valve endocarditis or pulmonary valve endocarditis in non-drug users (12-16). Most of the knowledge regarding the surgical therapy for tricuspid valve endocarditis is also based on RIE in IDUs, and the experience with surgical intervention in non-addict patients is limited in Western countries (17). Korea has a very low prevalence of intravenous drug use, and most cases of RIE in Korea occur in non-drug users unlike in Western countries. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective study to analyze the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of RIE in nondrug users.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients We performed a retrospective chart review of all cases diagnos­ ed with IE over a 14-yr period from January 1995 to January 2009 at the Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea), a tertiary university hospital. Cases were identified by all electronic discharge diagnoses of IE. Medical records, laboratory tests, and echocardiographic data of all the cases were reviewed. From the medi-

cal records, underlying medical disease, recent history of hospitalization, intravenous drug use including illicit drugs and medical drugs, and history of acupuncture were reviewed. If the patients had a history of intravenous illicit drug use on the records, we considered them as IDUs. The diagnoses of IE were retrospectively reassessed using the modified Duke criteria (2000). Finally, 345 cases, which satisfied the modified Duke criteria for a definite or possible IE diagnosis, were analyzed. According to the site of the detected vegetation, cases were divided into LIE or RIE. Among the 345 cases with IE, cases without definite vegetation or cases with vegetations in both sides of the heart on echocardiography were excluded from this analysis. Information pertaining to demographic characteristics, clinical, microbiological and echocardiographic features, outcome and complications was collected.
Echocardiography All of the patients included in this study underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was also performed in about half of the patients. We reviewed all available echocardiographic studies at the time of diagnosis, and focused on the vegetation site, vegetation size, the presence of severe regurgitation of the involved valve, and complications such as abscess and perforation. The vegetative mass was measured in various planes. Vegetation size was measured by maximal length and width during freeze-frame analysis. Valvular regurgitation and its severity were graded by color Doppler imaging, using semiquantitative standard criteria. A perivalvular abscess was defined as a circular echo density, without flow in its interior.
Microbiology Blood cultures were performed according to the hospital's standard guidelines, which recommend 3 culture sets from separate venipuncture sites when IE is suspected. However, in some cases, only 2 culture sets were obtained initially. Serological tests were not performed as part of the standard diagnostic procedure.
Definitions and analysis RIE was defined as IE with vegetation in the right atrium (RA), tricuspid valve (TV), right ventricle (RV), or pulmonary valve (PV). LIE was defined as IE with vegetation in the left atrium (LA), mitral valve (MV), left ventricle (LV), or aortic valve (AV). Nosocomial IE was defined as IE associated with medical procedures performed in a hospital within the 8-week period before the onset of the disease, and/or IE occurring at more than 72 hr after admission. The underlying cardiac condition was classified as normal valve, congenital structural abnormality, or prosthetic valve, which was observed by echocardiography. Congenital structural abnormality included only uncorrected

congenital heart disease (CHD) with structural abnormality, or corrected CHD with residual structural abnormality detected by echocardiography. Rheumatic heart disease or other abnormalities of native valves including degenerative changes were not categorized. Large vegetation was defined as vegetation equal to or larger than 2 cm in maximal length. Mural vegetation was defined as vegetation attached to sites other than valves, and it was mostly attached to the wall of one of the cardiac cavities. Embolic events included systemic embolism and pulmonary embolism. Only cases confirmed by imaging tests (computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or echocardiography) were counted. In-hospital mortality was defined as death between admission and discharge, regardless of the cause of death. Cases with both RIE and LIE were excluded from the analysis, and IE cases without vegetation were also not included. In order to investigate the features of RIE in non-drug users, we compared each finding of RIE to that of LIE diagnosed using the same diagnostic criteria during the same study period.
Statistics For comparisons in the distribution of continuous variables between RIE and LIE, Mann-Whitney U test was used; for comparisons of categorical variables, chi-square test was used and Fisher's exact test was used when the minimum expected count was less than 5. When the P value was less than 0.05, the difference was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).
Ethics statement This study was approved by institutional review board of Samsung Medical Center (IRB No. 2014-04-058), and the requirement of inform­ed consent was waived.
RESULTS
Patients During the 14-yr study period, 345 cases were diagnosed with IE using the modified Duke criteria. Among these 345 cases, 89 cases without vegetation and 11 cases with vegetation in both sides of the heart were excluded from the analysis. Among the 245 finally included cases, 206 cases (84.1%) were classified as LIE and 39 cases (15.9%) were classified as RIE (Fig. 1).
Clinical characteristics In our study population, there were no IDUs and no patients with HIV infection. The clinical characteristics of RIE compared with LIE are summarized in Table 1. In the RIE group, the mean age was significantly less than that in the LIE group (40.6 ± 19.0 yr vs 50.3 ± 18.0 yr, P = 0.004). Sex distribution was not different between the two groups (male; 69.2% vs 64.6%, P = 0.574). Cases with CVC (20.5% vs 3.9%, P = 0.001) and cases with CHD

The other patients had possible infective endocarditis according to the same criteria; Patients who were definitely diagnosed with malignancy and those who were in an active state of malignancy with or without current therapy were counted.

(35.7% vs 13.1%, P < 0.001) were more frequently found in the RIE group. Among the 15 RIE cases with CHD, ventricular septal defect (VSD) was the most common anomaly, and it was observed in 11 cases. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was observed in 2 cases, atrial septal defect (ASD) in 1 case, and tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) in 1 case. IE occurring in normal valve was also more common in the RIE group (33.3% vs 18.9%, P = 0.044). IE occurring in prosthetic valve was more common in the LIE group (2.6% vs 15.5%, P = 0.030). Among the 13 cases of RIE in a normal valve, there were 6 cases with CVC. The frequency of the following variables was not statistically different between the RIE and LIE groups; definite IE by modified Duke criteria (84.6% vs 81.1%, P = 0.600), nosocomial IE (25.6% vs 14.1%, P = 0.070), cases on hemodialysis (5.1% vs 4.9%, P = 0.942), and cases with malignancy (12.8% vs 12.1%, P = 0.999).
Echocardiographic findings All of the patients included in this study underwent TTE, while TEE was performed in 22 cases (56.4%) of the RIE group and in 124 cases (60.2%) of the LIE group. The echocardiographic find-

ings of two groups are shown in Table 2. In the RIE group, the TV was involved in 22 cases (56.4%), and 8 cases (20.5%) had vegetation on the PV. In the LIE group, the MV and AV were involved in 139 cases (67.5%) and 88 cases (42.7%), respectively. Mural vegetation was more frequently observed in the RIE group than in the LIE group (15.4% vs 0.5% in the ventricle, 12.8% vs 0.5% in the atrium, respectively). In the RIE group, all 6 cases with vegetation in the RV had VSD. Among the 5 cases with ve­ getation in the RA, 4 cases had an indwelling Hickman catheter. On comparing the vegetation size between the two groups, large vegetation (  2 cm) was more frequently observed in the RIE group (33.3% vs 9.3%, P < 0.001). Severe regurgitation was more common in the LIE group (48.1% vs 10.4%, P < 0.001). The frequency of detection of perivalvular abscess was not different between the two groups.
Microbiology Blood culture data for both RIE and LIE cases are presented in Table 3. The most frequent microorganism causing RIE was S. aureus (n = 13, 33.3%), followed by S. viridans (n = 11, 28.2%). In the LIE group, S. viridans (n = 64, 31.1%) was the most common causative bacteria and S. aureus (n = 39, 18.9%) was the second most common causative bacteria. The distribution of

causative microorganism was not significantly different between the RIE and LIE groups, except for S. aureus (33.3% vs 18.9%, respectively, P = 0.044). Among the other organisms, fungal infection caused RIE in 2 cases (5.1%) and LIE in 4 cases (2.0%) (data were not shown in Table 3). Six cases (15.4%) in the RIE group and 46 cases (22.3%) in the LIE group had culture-negative IE.
Outcome The short-term clinical outcomes in the two groups are shown in Table 4. Among the 39 cases in the RIE group, there were 5 deaths (12.8%) during hospitalization; and among the 206 cases in the LIE group, 26 patients (12.6%) died. In-hospital mortality rate was not different between the RIE and LIE groups (P = 0.973). Seventeen cases (43.6%) in the RIE group and 103 cases (50.0%) in the LIE group underwent cardiac surgery during hospitalization, and no difference was observed between the two groups (P = 0.463). Embolic events in the RIE and LIE groups were observed in 7 cases (17.9%) and 51 cases (24.8%), respectively (P = 0.359). Duration of hospitalization was not different between the two groups (43.0 ± 33.9 days vs 40.1 ± 28.8 days, P = 0.979). The characteristics of the five in-hospital mortality cases in the RIE group are described in Table 5. Mortality was directly associated with the following factors: uncontrolled sepsis (n = 2), intracranial hemorrhage (n = 1), pulmonary embolism (n = 1), and massive hematemesis (n = 1). Among these five in-hospital mortality cases, 2 cases had IE due to fungal etiology and 2 cases had large vegetation ( 2 cm).

DISCUSSION
Our study focused on investigating the clinical features of RIE in 39 non-drug users. In our series of RIE in non-IDUs, uncorrected CHD was the most frequent risk factor among the known risk factors of RIE, followed by CVC. In 15 cases of RIE with CHD, VSD was the most common anomaly. Previous reports on RIE occurring in patients with VSD showed that tricuspid valve involvement was the most common (15, 18). In our study population, the aortic valve (n = 9) was most frequently involved followed by the tricuspid valve (n = 8) in the total 27 IE cases with VSD. In addition, mural vegetation in the RV was observed in 4 patients with VSD. Isolated pulmonary valvular infective endocarditis (PVIE) is quite rare accounting for less than 1.5% to 2% of all cases of endocarditis (16). In the RIE group of the present study, the PV was involved in 8 cases; isolated PVIE was observ­ ed in 6 cases, and 2 cases had vegetations on the PV and in the RV. The underlying cardiac conditions in the 8 PVIE cases included PDA (n = 2), VSD (n = 2), ASD (n = 1), TOF (n = 1), and normal valve (n = 2). This finding is similar to the reported autopsy analysis of nine cases of PVIE in non-addicts (19).  Anguita Sanchez et al. reported that the overall inpatient mortality of IE in non-injection drug users was 17%, and they showed that the mortality was significantly decreased in recent years (20). The in-hospital mortality in all cases of our study was 12.7%, which was almost similar to that in the other series of IE (20-22). Although two recent studies of IE that were performed in Korea showed a lower in-hospital morality of 3.0% and 7.0% as compared to that in our study, this difference seem to be due to different study populations (23, 24). Unlike these studies, our study included all IE patients who had various medical illnesses ranging from malignancy to multiple trauma. When we compared

the in-hospital mortality between the first 7 yr and the next 7 yr during 14-yr study period, we observed a decrease in the inhospital mortality from 17.7% to 10.2%. On the other hand, IE in IDUs has a relatively good prognosis. The mortality rate of IE in drug users ranges from 5% to 10%, depending on the series (4, 25-27). A study including 220 IDUs with IE reported a mortality rate of 5.2% from RIE in IDUs and a mortality rate of 11% from LIE in IDUs, thus showing an overall mortality rate of 6% from IE in IDUs (7). Thalme et al. found that treatment results for RIE in IDUs were good with no in-hospital mortality, no surgery, no relapses and no increase in long-term mortality (8). Unlike the prognosis of RIE in IDUs, the present study showed an in-hospital mortality of 12.8% in the RIE group, which was not better than that in the LIE group. In addition, the need for in-hospital cardiac surgery (43.6%) in the RIE group was not different from that in the LIE group. The high percentage of coexisting CHD with RIE may have resulted in a frequent need for cardiac surgery in the RIE group in this study.  S. aureus has been reported as the most common etiological pathogen, and it is observed in more than 50% of IE occurring in IDUs (9, 10, 25). Miró et al. showed that RIE in IDUs was casused by S. aureus in 77% (25). In this study also, S. aureus was the leading etiological agent of RIE (39% in positive culture), but the percentage was not as high as that in RIE occurring in IDUs. The distribution of causative organisms other than S. aureus and the proportion of negative culture were not significantly different between the RIE and LIE groups. When we analyzed the in-hospital mortality and in-hospital cardiac surgery for different etiologies, there were no statistically significant differences in either mortality or frequency of cardiac surgery (data not shown). A previous report documented that vegetation size larger than 2 cm and fungal etiology in RIE associated with in-hospital mortality (7). In our study, large vegetation (  2 cm) was more commonly observed in the RIE group than in the LIE group. Among the five mortality cases in the RIE group, 2 cases had large vegetation, and in 2 cases, fungal infection was the etiology for RIE. However, because of the small number of patients, the prognostic significance of these findings remains unclear in this study.  Our study has several limitations. This study included a relatively small number of patients, especially in the RIE group. That is because RIE is far less common compared to LIE. In addition, the present study was a retrospective study. Although we could not identify any patients who use intravenous illicit drugs from the medical records, it may be possible that this information could have been missed during history taking. This problem is intrinsic to retrospective studies. However, there is a much smaller population that use intravenous illicit drugs in Korea compared to Western countries. Finally, the study subjects had various medical illness other than IE, which may make it difficult to compare the mortality in this study with that in another study.

 In conclusion, in-hospital mortality and need for in-hospital cardiac surgery in RIE among non-drug users were not different from those in LIE; however, RIE in IDUs showed a favorable prognosis in previous reports. The most important risk factors for RIE in non-drug users are CHD and indwelling CVC. S. aureus is the most common etiological pathogen of RIE in nondrug users.

Many factors, including professional and personal relationships and activities, can influence the design, conduct, and reporting of the clinical science that informs health care decision. The potential for conflict of interest exists when these relationships and activities may bias judgement.1 Many stakeholders--editors, peer reviewers, clinicians, educators, policymakers, patients, and the public--rely on the disclosure of authors' relationships and activities to inform their assessments. Trust in the transparency, consistency, and completeness of these disclosures is essential.
Ten years ago, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) adopted the "ICMJE Form for the Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest" as a uniform mechanism for collecting and reporting authors' relationships and activities that readers might consider relevant to a published work.2 The goal was to avoid the confusion (and often ensuing controversy) created when journals vary in how they collect and report this information. We believe a uniform disclosure form has been helpful, but problems remain. First, the software supporting the current form is increasingly problematic, making its use difficult or impossible for an increasing number of authors. More important, however, is that many authors and readers misunderstand, misapply, or misinterpret the disclosures.

Disclaimer Dr. Sahni's affiliation as representative and past president of the World Association of Medical Editors (WAME) does not imply endorsement by WAME member journals that are not part of the ICMJE.

Although some individuals violate the public trust by purposefully hiding relevant relationships and activities, we believe most authors are committed to transparent reporting and consider it as vital to the advancement of clinical science. Nonetheless, disagreement, confusion, and controversy regarding authors' disclosures arise when opinions differ over which relationships and activities to report. An author might not report an item that others deem important because of a difference in opinion regarding what is "relevant," confusion over definitions, or a simple oversight. Some authors may be concerned that readers will interpret the listing of any item as a "potential conflict of interest" as indicative of problematic influence and wrongdoing, a concern often raised regarding the requirement to report publicly funded grants. For their part, some readers fail to recognize that their own relationships and activities influence how they assess the work of others and what they deem to be a "conflict" for others or themselves.
We propose several changes to the ICMJE disclosure form to help address these issues. First, words matter. Despite including the word "potential," a form entitled "... for the Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest" may imply that any relationship or activity listed represents a problematic influence or wrongdoing. The proposed new title, "The ICMJE Disclosure Form," aims to dispel that interpretation and potential stigma. Second, we no longer ask authors to decide what might be interpreted as a potential conflict of interest. Authors disclose their relationships and activities so that readers can decide whether these relationships or activities should influence their assessments of the work. Further, to avoid omissions-inadvertent or purposeful-we now provide a checklist of relationships and activities for authors to complete.
We welcome feedback about the proposed new form, which is available with a link to provide comments, at www.icmje.org. We will consider comments received by 30 April 2020, before finalizing and adopting a revised version. In the interim, the extant "ICMJE Form for the Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest" will remain in use and available as a downloadable PDF at our website (Supplementary Data).

In a further step to avoid inconsistencies and omissions, and to help ease the disclosure process for authors, some journals will change the mechanism by which disclosures are collected. Authors are required to provide disclosures to multiple entities (e.g., to academic institutions, continuing education providers, guideline and other committees as well as medical journals). Disclosing information repeatedly, with varying reporting requirements, formats, and definitions, is frustrating for authors and contributes to problematic and controversial discrepancies across disclosures. The ICMJE will therefore accept disclosures from web-based repositories. These enable authors to maintain an inventory of their relationships and activities and create electronic disclosures tailored to the requirements of entities such as ICMJE, without having to reenter information repeatedly.

ICMJE will accept disclosures from repositories that meet the following criteria: collection and reporting of relationships and activities consistent with ICMJE requirements; no fees for individuals to enter, store, or export their data; provision of disclosures to journals electronically as well as an option for journals without a digital interface; and compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

A Disclosure Form for Work Submitted to Medical Journals
One currently available repository that is consistent with these criteria is Convey (www. convey.org), but we encourage the development of other repositories as necessary to meet regional, linguistic, and regulatory needs. A template that enables authors to create disclosures that emulate the extant "ICMJE Form for the Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest" is already available at the Convey platform, and some of our journals have begun to collect author disclosures electronically in this way. This template will be updated to conform to the new ICMJE Disclosure Form when it is finalized, and all ICMJE journals can begin accepting disclosures in this manner. Ultimately, the currently employed PDF-based ICMJE form will be unavailable.
While no approach to disclosure will be perfect or foolproof, we hope the changes we propose will help promote transparency and trust. We look forward to your feedback.

Background: Generating good training datasets is essential for machine learningbased nuclei detection methods. However, creating exhaustive nuclei contour annotations, to derive optimal training data from, is often infeasible. Methods: We compared different approaches for training nuclei detection methods solely based on nucleus center markers. Such markers contain less accurate information, especially with regard to nuclear boundaries, but can be produced much easier and in greater quantities. The approaches use different automated sample extraction methods to derive image positions and class labels from nucleus center markers. In addition, the approaches use different automated sample selection methods to improve the detection quality of the classification algorithm and reduce the run time of the training process. We evaluated the approaches based on a previously published generic nuclei detection algorithm and a set of Ki67stained breast cancer images. Results: A Voronoi tessellationbased sample extraction method produced the best performing training sets. However, subsampling of the extracted training samples was crucial. Even simple class balancing improved the detection quality considerably. The incorporation of active learning led to a further increase in detection quality. Conclusions: With appropriate sample extraction and selection methods, nuclei detection algorithms trained on the basis of simple center marker annotations can produce comparable quality to algorithms trained on conventionally created training sets.

Introduction
Many pathological assessments depend on the quantification of cell nuclei. In cancer diagnosis, for instance, the quantification of nuclei expressing the Ki67 protein is a widely used method to determine the proliferation rate of a tumor. Furthermore, the quantification of lymphocytic infiltrates has been shown to be of strong prognostic importance.[1] Another important application is the determination of the progesterone and estrogen receptor status. The latter is arguably the most important predictive biomarker that exists today.[2] In clinical routine, such evaluations are usually done manually by estimating or counting a small number of nuclei, which is highly subjective and often not reproducible.[3] Consequently, the ability to automatically detect different types of nuclei on larger regions becomes increasingly important.
Varying staining and tissue preprocessing conditions, as well as different nuclear types and pathologies, lead to a huge variability in the appearance of nuclei, making their automatic detection very challenging. Recent approaches employ

trainable algorithms to address this issue, including traditional machine learning[46] as well as deep learning methods.[79] Trainable detection methods come with the advantage of being adaptable and refinable by just using different training datasets.
Generating a good training dataset is essential for such methods. Most of these methods learn some kind of pixelwise distinction between nuclear and nonnuclear regions,[4,69] to either create an intermediate segmentation or a probability map. Hence, the optimal training data would consist of exhaustive manual segmentations of all nuclei in several histological images. Unfortunately, creating such annotations requires an expert to accurately draw contour lines around each nucleus, making it a very tedious and timeconsuming task.

Annotation marks at the nuclear centers constitute an alternative kind of reference data. Center annotations can be created with much less effort because they only require the expert to mark nuclei with a single click. This makes the marking process much faster and, therefore, also allows larger amounts of images to be annotated. Obviously, such annotations comprise much less information than full segmentations.
Center marker annotations have already been employed in the past. The different approaches address their insufficiency by augmenting them in various ways. An iterative thresholding approach was used by GulMohammed et al.[10] to distinguish nuclear and nonnuclear areas around the center markers. In a study by Janowczyk and Madabhushi,[9] this distinction is performed by a naive Bayesian classifier with center positions as nuclear training data and randomly selected noncenter positions as nonnuclear training data. However, these approaches tie the capability of the machinelearning algorithm to the capability of the previous step. In both the studies by Sirinukunwattana et al.[11] and Xu et al.,[8] an assumption regarding the size of the nuclei is incorporated to supplement the annotation data: In a study by Sirinukunwattana et al.,[11] a regression is trained using the distance to the next center marker to compute the target value. In a study by Xu et al.,[8] nonnuclear training samples were drawn from positions that are further away from any center marker than a given threshold.
The quality of the mentioned approaches is hard to compare as the authors usually use different data sets with different nuclear types and often also different quality measures.
In a study by Vink et al.,[4] a nucleus detection method for Her2stained breast tissue is proposed. The authors report a detection rate, which equals recall, of 0.95. Breast tissue nuclei are also detected in the studies conducted by Xing et al.[7] and Xu et al.[8] The approaches work on H&Estained images and yield f1measures of 0.78 and 0.84, respectively. In the study conducted by Arteta et al.[5] and Janowczyk and Madabhushi,[9] lymphocytic nuclei are detected in H&Estained breast images. They state f1measures of 0.88 and 0.90, respectively. Kårsnäs et al.[6] reported that a detection method for Ki67positive nuclei in breast tissue is proposed. The authors announce 1.0% missing objects, 2.6% missing annotations, and 4.1% multiple annotations. A nuclei detection method for H&Estained colorectal tissue is described by Sirinukunwattana et al.[11] and an f1measure of 0.80 is reported.
In this paper, we perform a systematic comparison of different methods for generating training sets solely from center marker annotations. In addition, we evaluate how the proposed center markerbased sample extraction methods compare with manual segmentations.
Methods
Training set generation A training set consists of a set of training samples, which in turn consist of a feature vector and a class label. The
2

http://www.jpathinformatics.org/content/8/1/21
content of the feature vector depends on the classification method that is to be trained. It might comprise handcrafted features or in case of feature learning methods such as deep convolutional neural networks, small image patches. In both cases, a training sample is produced with respect to a given position in the image.
All of the examined training set generation approaches consist of two main steps, which are the extraction and the selection of training samples.
Given a set of training images with labeled center markers, the extraction step needs to identify image positions that can be labeled as nuclear or nonnuclear regions and derive a training sample from it. The main difficulty here is that center markers obviously provide far less information about the nuclear and nonnuclear regions in the image, especially with regard to their boundaries.
The output of the extraction step already forms a valid training set. However, the abundance of training samples often deteriorates the analysis quality and the runtime performance for the training process of the classifier. Depending on the type of the classifier, also, the runtime of the nuclei detection can be increased considerably. Thus, the second step of the considered training set generation approaches is the selection of optimal subsets of training samples.
Training sample extraction We compare two different methods for extracting training samples from a given set of images.
Distancebased We assume that positions close to the annotated center markers can be considered to represent nuclear regions whereas positions far away from any center marker are very likely to represent nonnuclear regions. Training samples are extracted as follows:
For each position x, y in an image, we compute the distance to the closest center marker. That distance and the index of that closest marker are stored in two maps d(x, y) and m(x, y). To be designated as nuclear region, a position must not be further away from the closest marker than a threshold called tnuc. Thus, all positions x, y where d(x, y) < tnuc can be labeled as nuclear region. To be designated as nonnuclear region, a position may not be closer to any marker than a threshold called tbg. Consequently, all positions x, y where d(x, y) > tbg are labeled as nonnuclear region. For our experiments, we set tbg to 15 pixels and tnuc to 3 pixels each at 20× resolution.
Voronoibased The distancebased approach has the drawback that the boundary positions of the nuclei are not considered at all. Boundary positions, however, are very informative because they shape the decision boundaries of the classifier. In our case, nuclear boundaries should be labeled as nonnuclear region so that clustered nuclei can be separated by the classifier. The Voronoibased extraction method augments the distancebased method with such boundary samples.

The marker map m(x, y) is equivalent to the Voronoi diagram of the center markers. Assuming that neighboring nuclei are similarly sized, the Voronoi boundary between nontouching nuclei only crosses nonnuclear regions. As soon as two nuclei are touching, the Voronoi boundary crosses exactly that touching point. Consequently, for overlapping nuclei, the region of overlap is crossed by the Voronoi boundary. The assumption above may not always be valid, leading to Voronoi boundaries crossing nuclear regions, but we found that being a rare case in our experiments. Thus, the Voronoi boundaries are suited to extract nonnuclear samples along them.
Figure 1 illustrates the sample extraction methods.
Training sample selection Selecting a subset of training samples from those extracted in the previous step can be beneficial. Reducing the amount of samples leads to a decrease of the runtime of the training process. For some classifiers, such as the random forest, the runtime of the classification is reduced as well.
Moreover, subsets of training samples often result in a higher quality of the nuclei detection if the samples show class imbalance. The extraction methods generally produce more samples of nonnuclear regions than nuclear regions because of the relative area fractions in the image. A small tnuc further increases that imbalance. A classifier confronted with substantial class imbalance is deluged by instances of the majority class, leading it to ignore the instances of the minority class. Such imbalance is a wellknown issue in the field of machine learning.[12]
During the training of a machinelearning classifier, the most interesting regions of the feature space are those close to the decision boundary of the classifier. Here, the classifier is most uncertain. That is why samples near the decision boundary are much more informative than samples far away. The ratio between samples of high and low informativeness in a training set can have a strong influence on the resulting detection quality. The samples extracted in the previous step are, in addition to the class imbalance stated above, likely to contain a large amount of uninformative instances.

The center image shows the positions, where nonnuclear samples are extracted in gray and those where nuclear samples are extracted in red and blue for positively and negatively stained nuclei, respectively. The right image additionally shows the Voronoi boundaries in black, where also nonnuclear samples are extracted in the Voronoibased extraction method

We investigated three different sample selection methods addressing the described issues.
Stratified random subsampling The most straightforward way to reduce the amount of samples and to achieve a balance of the class labels is stratified random subsampling. From each class, samples are randomly drawn until a target number is reached or until there are no more samples of one class available. This method has the advantage that it can be integrated into the sample extraction methods. The subsampling can be already applied to the image positions before the features are calculated. This leads to a much better runtime performance than subsampling the samples in a separate step afterward.
Kdtree subsampling In the study by Pechenizkiy et al.,[13] the Kdtree subsampling is suggested as an alternative or supplementary method for stratified random subsampling. It also reduces the number of samples while retaining their distribution in feature space. The general concept of the Kdtree is explained by Bentley.[14] For the sample selection task, a Kdtree with limited depth is constructed on the extracted samples using their features as dimensions. In each node, the splitting feature is chosen as that with maximum variance across the samples of the node and the median is used as pivot, as suggested by Omohundro.[15] Then, a single sample can be drawn randomly from each leaf of the tree. The granularity and the amount of resulting samples can be controlled by adjusting the depth limit of the tree. To also address class imbalance, we apply the Kdtree subsampling independently for both classes and join the sample sets afterward.
Active learning Active learning[16] selects samples with respect to their informativeness to the classifier. A classifier is trained using a subset S of the available samples. Then, iteratively, the remainder of the samples is classified and the classification confidence for each sample is considered. The samples with the least confident classifications are added to S for the next iteration. The iterations are terminated as soon as the size of S reaches a target number. By following this uncertainty sampling approach, the most informative samples are chosen from the training set. In our implementation, to produce a training set of n samples, the first subset is generated by randomly choosing n/10 samples from the available samples and n/100 samples are added in each iteration. In contrast to the previous methods, active learning does not address any class imbalance of the sample set.
The training sample selection methods are applied to either the samples extracted from a single image or the whole set of extracted samples. They can also be combined to utilize their different strengths.
Experimental setup The different sample extraction and selection methods were compared using image data from a study described by Molin et al.[17] In that study, eight pathologists were asked to select

circular hotspot regions containing approximately 200 nuclei from digitized Ki67stained breast tumor slides. From these hotspots, areas containing staining or scanning errors as well as overlapping areas were removed resulting in a set of 101 hotspots from 24 different slides and cases. The digitized slides were downsampled if necessary to a magnification of 20×, and for each hotspot, a subimage containing that region was extracted. Center marker annotations for all nuclei within the circular hotspot regions were created by a trained expert and verified by an experienced breast pathologist. Figure 2 examplary shows annotated hot-spot regions.
The evaluation is based on the nuclei detection method described by Kost et al.[18] A random forest assigns a probability value to each input image pixel for being close to the center of a nucleus. The feature set comprises: · The normalized H, S, and V color channels · The box filtered S channel · An approximation of the difference of Gaussian on the S
channel using box filters · The radial symmetry on the S channel · The box filtered radial symmetry.
Then, an optimized gray scale watershed algorithm is used to find and separate the individual nuclear regions. The algorithm is configured to only include positions with probability values above 0.5 into the nuclear regions as lower values indicate that it is more likely that the position belongs to background than to a nucleus. Another random forest uses the H, S, and V color channels to classify the staining within the nuclear regions and performs a majority vote to decide whether a nucleus is Ki67 positive or negative.
To train the second classifier, we used modified versions of the sample extraction methods. For each position x, y with d(x, y) < tnuc, an additional training sample for the second classifier was generated. The class label of the training sample was set depending on whether m (x, y) corresponds to a center marker of a Ki67 positive or negative nucleus. This way, one training set was produced for each classifier. The selection methods were then applied to both sets individually using the same parameters.
The quality of the nuclei detection was assessed by comparing the results to the center marker annotations. Each detected

nucleus was assigned to the closest center marker, provided that the distance of their positions was sufficiently close. A threshold of 10 pixels was found to be adequate. It corresponds to the approximate radius of the nuclei in the images. A onetoone match was then considered a true positive (TP), a detected nucleus without a matching annotation was considered a false positive (FP), and an annotation without a matching detected nucleus considered a false negative (FN). In case when multiple detected nuclei were matched with the same center marker, one of these was considered TP whereas the others were counted as FP. Based on these values, precision, recall, and the f1measure were computed as overall quality measures.
For the experiments, we combined the sample extraction and selection methods in several ways to produce different training sets. The nuclei detection algorithm was then trained using these sample sets and the quality of the detection was assessed. To produce more robust results, the experiments were performed with 5fold crossvalidation. The folds were created in a way that images originating from the same slide were assigned to the same fold. This way, no training set is tested on the same slide it is created from. For all experiments, the same folds were used to ensure comparability. The quality measures of the individual folds were averaged to obtain the final measures.
Results
Experiment 1: Comparison of sample extraction and selection combinations For the following experiment setups, distinct sample sets have been extracted by the distancebased and the Voronoibased method. Then, different combinations of sample selection methods were applied to these sample sets. To obtain comparable results, all experiments, but (1a), which incorporates no selection method, produce a training set containing 2000 samples. This amount was found to produce adequate results while keeping the processing time for the classifier at an acceptable level. For the experiments involving two selection methods, the first one was applied per input image, leaving 256 samples per image. The latter one then was applied to the total of the remaining samples.

selected from the remaining samples using the active learning selection method (g) AL + random: The effect of inverting the order of experiment (e) was examined. The active learning selection method was applied per image, followed by the stratified random subsampling selection method (h) AL + Kdtree: The effect of inverting the order of experiment (f ) was examined. The active learning selection method was applied per image, followed by the Kdtree subsampling selection method (i) Kdtree + random: In this experiment, both class balancing methods were combined. The Kdtree subsampling selection method was first applied per image, and then the stratified random subsampling selection method was applied on the remaining samples afterward (j) AL + AL: In this experiment, the active learning selection method was applied to both the perimage and the remaining samples.
Table 1 shows the results of the described experiment setups. First of all, we can state that the Voronoibased extraction method yields quality measures slightly superior to the distancebased method in most experiment setups. Looking at the selection methods, we can see that the experiments that do not comprise a class balancing method lead to far worse quality measures. This can be observed in experiments (1d) and (1j), which only consist of active learning, and especially in experiment (1a), where no selection is performed at all. The

http://www.jpathinformatics.org/content/8/1/21
best results are obtained by the combinations that include class balancing and active learning.
The tested sample extraction methods produce highly imbalanced training sets. On average, only 6.09% or 5.54% of the samples belong to the nuclear class for the distancebased and Voronoibased extraction, respectively. The imbalance affects the resulting classification in a negative way. This can be observed in experiment (1a). The detection quality for the unprocessed training sets is low.
The usage of active learning alone, as shown in experiments (1d) and (1j), does improve the detection quality slightly but still yields results well inferior to other experiments. This indicates that active learning is not very well suited to deal with these large imbalances, which stems from the way active learning selects new samples. When there are mostly nonnuclear samples to choose from, the most uncertain samples are likely to be imbalanced toward nonnuclear samples as well. For this reason, a proper balancing of the samples is advisable.
The absence of class balancing in experiments (1a), (1d), and (1j) results in a strong bias of the classifier, which can be observed as a considerable difference in the precision and recall values. In experiment 2, precisionrecallcurves (PRcurves) are analyzed to further examine this issue.
The stratified random subsampling and the Kdtreebased selection seem to be equally suited for balancing as

the comparison of the quality measures in experiments (1b) and (1c), (1e) and (1f), as well as (1g) and (1h) indicates. However, since stratified random subsampling is much simpler and improves the runtime performance when integrated into the extraction step, it is to be preferred over the Kdtreebased approach. The best results were achieved by experiment setup (1e) being the combination of Voronoibased extraction, stratified random subsampling, and active learning. Two example outputs are visualized in Figure 3. Another interesting approach is (1b), the solely applied stratified random subsampling. It is simple, yields good results, and has a good runtime performance due to the integrability into the sample extraction step. However, in general, the differences of the methods that use balancing are rather small. In contrast, the differences between the methods with and without balancing are major.
Experiment 2: Precisionrecallcurves As described in section 2.2, a cutoff value of 0.5 was used for the experiments, which is the natural threshold for a twoclass problem. However, it is interesting to investigate how different cutoff values influence precision and recall.
For each approach described in experiment 1, the cutoff value was altered in 16 steps between 0 and 1, and at each step, precision and recall were determined. Figure 4 shows the PRcurves for all approaches in an overview graph. In the subsequent graphs, the curves are reduced and grouped to highlight different aspects. Furthermore, the axes are scaled to only show the most interesting quadrant of the graph.
In Figure 5, the PRcurves are divided into approaches that contain a sample selection method and approaches that do not, which is only the case for (1a) curves. It is clearly visible that the application of even the most basic sample selection methods improves the quality of the nuclei detection considerably. This is the case for both sample extraction methods.
Figure 6 shows the approaches that contain sample selection grouped according to their sample extraction methods. Here, it becomes apparent that the Voronoibased extraction leads to better results than the distancebased extraction. This is especially the case for recall.
In Figure 7, only the approaches using the Voronoibased sample extraction are plotted. We found that approaches consisting of two subsequent sample selection methods with at least one of them incorporating active learning perform especially well. These approaches are highlighted in this figure. Active learning per image followed by a selection that performs class balancing (1g) and (1h) leads to the best results for both extraction methods.
The PRcurves shown in this section have an unusual shape. Normally, with cutoff values becoming lower, the precision declines while the recall grows toward 1. In our case, the recall does not increase after a certain value but decreases again. The reason for this behavior is the watershed algorithm which is part of the nuclei detection method. This limits the number of detected nuclei. With a low cutoff value, more pixel positions

Figure 5: Precisionrecallcurves showing the quality improvements when using a sample selection method (blue) compared to approaches without sample extraction (gray) are being considered by the algorithm. Nevertheless, those are likely to be assigned to an existing nuclear region instead of constituting a new region. Another effect is that the nuclear

regions, which are segmented by the watershed algorithm, become larger. The nuclear positions are computed as the center points of the nuclear regions and the positivity of the nuclei is derived from the staining classification results within the nuclear regions. When such regions become unreasonably large, nuclear positions or their positivity might become incorrect. This effect causes the decrease of recall at low cutoff values.
Experiment 3: Impact of the training set size The impact of the training set size on the quality of the nuclei detection was evaluated in experiment 3. Training sets of different sizes were produced using the Voronoibased extraction method, followed by a selection method as described in (1b) and (1e), which appeared to be the most interesting approaches in experiment 1. For the latter approach, the active learning was parametrized to select 10% of the samples selected by the stratified random subsampling, which is comparable to the ratio in the above experiments. The overall f1measure of the training sets was then assessed to compare the learning curves of these two methods. Training set sizes from 100 up to 5000 samples have been evaluated with an offset of 100 and up to 15,000 samples with an offset of 1000.
Figure 8 shows the results of experiment 3. Both learning curves have an approximately asymptotic shape. They rise steeply until about 2000 samples and ascend more slowly afterward. Nevertheless, the learning curve for the approach containing active learning shows superior quality values throughout all training set sizes. The experiment shows that the number of 2000 samples for a training set is a reasonable choice. Although more samples would slightly increase the quality of the nuclei detection, we consider this a good compromise between quality and runtime performance.
Experiment 4: Comparison of extraction methods with manual segmentations To assess the quality of the sample extraction methods, we compared a manual nuclei segmentation with the proposed distance and Voronoibased extraction methods. To produce a training set from segmentation annotations, nonnuclear samples were generated from all positions outside nuclear regions. Since the trained method should yield maximum nucleus probability at the center of the nuclei, the nuclear samples were only generated at the centers of the nuclei, equally to the extraction methods proposed.
As the selection method, we used stratified random subsampling per image followed by active learning (1e), which appeared to achieve the best results in experiment 1. We used ten images with exhaustive nuclei segmentation annotations which do not belong to the image set used in experiment 1-3. Samples were extracted from the annotations for each pixel. To compare those samples with the described extraction methods, the segmentation annotations were reduced to center markers by computing the center of gravity of each segment. For this experiment, we did not perform a crossvalidation but tested the resulting training sets using the image set described above. The

experiment was repeated five times to average out randomness in the used algorithms.
Table 2 shows the results of experiment 4. It appears that the manual extraction yields only marginally better results than the approaches based on center markers. Since the quality of the segmentationbased samples is certainly better than of those of the proposed methods, the low difference of the methods might seem unexpected. However, the produced training sets are all subject to the same selection process so that these quality differences manifest less noticeable in the final results.
Conclusions
The quality of machine learningbased nuclei detection methods is fundamentally dependent on the training data used. Ideally, training data should be generated from manual segmentations of a large number of nuclei, which is, however, a timeconsuming and tedious task.
In this paper, we proposed and compared approaches to produce training sets from easy to generate center marker annotations. We divided the training set generation into a sample extraction and a sample selection step. The samples were extracted using a distancebased or a Voronoi boundarybased method. Training sets were selected from the resulting sample sets using different combinations of stratified random subsampling, Kdtree subsampling, and active learning.
For evaluation, we trained a nuclei detection method with these training sets and assessed the resulting detection quality measures. In addition, we investigated the influence of the cutoff value on these measures. For a cutoff value of 0.5, the default threshold for twoclass problems, class balancing had the largest positive impact on the detection quality. Independent of the cutoff value, the best results were obtained using training sets produced by Voronoibased sample extraction and sample selection methods that incorporate active learning. We also evaluated the influence of the training set size on the detection quality. The quality increased quickly until approximately 2000 samples and more moderate afterward. In a fourth evaluation, a comparison revealed that the f1measures obtained using the proposed extraction methods almost reached the values obtained using samples generated from manual segmentations.
We conclude that the usage of center marker annotations in conjunction with appropriate sample extraction and selection

methods represents a valid alternative to conventionally produced training sets. In this manner, the effort for the creation of annotations can be greatly reduced.
In addition, while machine learningbased nuclei detection methods are usually trained on all training samples available, our study shows that subselecting samples can improve the detection quality considerably at no additional cost in terms of execution time or complexity of the nuclei detection method.
In future work, we will further evaluate the general applicability of the proposed approaches using different image datasets and detection algorithms, especially within the area of deep learning.

Purpose: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pregabalin versus other analgesics among patients with chronic cervical pain with neuropathic components during routine clinical practice in Japan. Patients and methods: The analysis considered patients with chronic cervical pain with a neuropathic pain component (radiating pain to the upper limb) and who were treated with pregabalin with or without other analgesics (pregabalin-containing treatments) or other analgesics alone (usual care) for 8 weeks. Other analgesics included non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), weak opioids, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs. A Markov cohort simulation model was constructed to estimate costs and effectiveness (in terms of quality-adjusted life-years, QALYs) of each treatment over a 12-month time horizon. In the model, patients transitioned among three states of pain severity (no/mild, moderate, and severe). Data were derived from a previous observational study (pregabalincontaining treatments, n = 138; usual care, n = 211). Cost inputs included medical costs and productivity losses. QALYs were calculated using the EuroQol five-dimensional, five-level questionnaire. The cost-effectiveness was evaluated using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of results. Results: From the payer's perspective, pregabalin-containing treatments were more costly (JPY 61,779 versus JPY 26,428) but also more effective (0.763 QALYs versus 0.727 QALYs) than the usual care, with an ICER of JPY 970,314 per QALY gained. From the societal perspective, which also included productivity losses, the ICER reduced to JPY 458,307 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results. Given a hypothetical threshold value of one additional QALY of JPY 5,000,000, the probability of pregabalin-containing treatments being cost-effective was 100%. Conclusion: Compared with using other analgesics alone, the use of pregabalin, alone or in addition to other analgesics, was cost-effective for the treatment of chronic cervical pain with a neuropathic pain component in Japan. Keywords: neuropathic pain, quality-adjusted life-year, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, health economics

Introduction
Chronic neck pain is a common global health problem, with an estimated prevalence of 358 million people in 2015.1 According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, low back and neck pain was the leading global cause of disability.1
Neck pain is also common among Japanese people, with the prevalence of neck and shoulder pain being 48.3%.2 Among people with chronic musculoskeletal pain in

Japan, the neck was the second most common site of pain (55%) after the lower back (65%), and about 20% of people with chronic pain reported the neck as the site of most persistent pain.3
Different pathophysiological mechanisms can categorize neck pain as nociceptive, neuropathic, or secondary to another cause.4 Among them, neuropathic pain (NeP) causes great burden; for example, patients with chronic NeP have more severe pain than those with other chronic pain,5 experience poor quality of life (QOL), and have high healthcare costs.6 Common neck pain conditions that involve NeP include cervical radiculopathy, cervical myelopathy, and cervical disc herniation. Although no data are available on the prevalence of chronic neck pain with NeP components, one study previously reported that approximately half of neck pain patients unresponsive to previous treatment had at least some NeP components.7 To lessen the burden on these patients, appropriate treatment should be provided to patients with neck pain with a NeP component.
Pregabalin, a ligand for the 2- subunit of voltagegated calcium ion channels, is recommended as a first-line medication in the pharmacotherapy for NeP.8-10 In the US, pregabalin is indicated only for specific pain conditions (that is, NeP associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy or spinal cord injury, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia).11 However, in Japan where the indication of pregabalin was expanded to NeP in 2013,12 it can be used for patients with NeP associated with cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy. Pregabalin is also widely used for NeP treatment in the EU, where it has broad indications for peripheral and central NeP in adults.13
We previously examined the effectiveness of pregabalin for patients with chronic cervical pain with a NeP component in a Japanese clinical setting.14 In that observational study, patients who recently initiated pregabalin treatment, with or without other analgesics, reported a significant improvement in pain and sleep compared with those who continued to be treated only with conventional analgesics (such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and weak opioids). The results showed the clinical benefits of pregabalin for the management of this NeP condition. However, the study seemed to reveal that many patients with this condition are treated with only conventional analgesics like NSAIDs in real-world clinical settings in Japan, which is against guideline recommendations.10
In Japan, pregabalin treatment was shown to be a costeffective treatment for peripheral NeP15 and chronic low back pain with a NeP component.16 However, to our knowledge,

the cost-effectiveness of pregabalin for chronic neck pain with a NeP component has not yet been evaluated in Japan or any other nation. As its effectiveness has already been shown,14 if evidence reveals that using pregabalin is also a cost-effective treatment for this NeP condition, it may help facilitate the use of pregabalin for the management of these patients. Therefore, in this analysis, we evaluated whether using pregabalin, alone or in addition to other analgesics, is cost-effective for the treatment of patients with chronic cervical pain with a NeP component, using data from the above-mentioned observational study.14
Methods
Our cost-effectiveness analysis used a Markov cohort simulation model to estimate costs and effectiveness (in terms of quality-adjusted life-years, QALYs) of pregabalin with or without other analgesics (pregabalin-containing treatments) versus other analgesics only (usual care) for the treatment of chronic cervical pain with a NeP component, over a 12-month time horizon. Other analgesics used in usual care included NSAIDs, weak opioids, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs. The cost-effectiveness of pregabalin was evaluated using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the healthcare payer's perspective and also from the societal perspective, with the latter including productivity losses. This analysis was based on data taken from a previously conducted study (details provided below), which received ethical approval from the Byoin-Godo Ethical Review Board. Ethical approval was not obtained for the present cost-effectiveness analysis because it was an analysis that used only existing data without involving any new data collection.
Model Structure
A Markov model was constructed to simulate the course of a cohort for a 12-month time horizon, with a 1-month cycle. The model had three health states describing the level of pain severity, which was determined based on the numerical rating scale (NRS) scores: no/mild pain (score 03), moderate pain (46), and severe pain (710). At the start of the model, patients began with a state of either moderate or severe pain. Patients then remained in the severity category or transitioned to another category at monthly intervals for the initial two months, according to transition probabilities. From month 3 onwards, patients remained in the same severity category as that at the end of month 2 (Figure 1). In the model, treatment discontinuation was assumed to occur in month 1. Once treatment

Figure 1 Framework of the Markov model used for analysis. Pain severity categories were determined based on a numerical rating scale (NRS) score for pain severity (range: 0 to 10). Three severity categories were defined as follows: no/mild pain (NRS score 03), moderate pain (46), and severe pain (710).

was discontinued, the pain NRS score was modeled to revert to the score at baseline. Then, the score was maintained on the conservative assumption that the treatment was no longer effective. Using the constructed model, costs and QALYs were estimated for each treatment group. Due to the short time horizon (12-month), this analysis did not consider a discount for estimation of costs and QALYs.
In the model, the pain severity category at the end of month 2 was maintained for the extended period (months 3 12), based on Japanese long-term studies showing that improved pain scores achieved within 8 weeks of treatment with pregabalin were sustained for the study period over 52 weeks.17,18 The 12-month time horizon was chosen as the target disease is a chronic condition and patients can be treated with pregabalin for over a year. This time horizon was also used in previous cost-effectiveness analyses of pregabalin for NeP in Japan.15,16 In the present analysis, the model did not assume the potential for patients undergoing surgery because of its low probability. Surgery may be considered when patients have progressive symptoms such as gait disorders or impaired hand dexterity, or when conservative management strategies are not successful. However, there is no established consensus on the indications for surgery in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy and cervical radiculopathy,19-21 and a conservative therapy is usually chosen, especially for patients with mild symptoms or older patients. Furthermore, this analysis included patients exhibiting stable conditions who sought

medical care in a primary care setting. Thus, we expected that the possibility of surgery would be fairly low among patients included in this analysis.
Data
Data were obtained from our previous non-interventional observational study in a Japanese primary care setting.14 Patients were those aged 20 years with chronic (12 weeks) cervical pain with pain radiating to the upper limb, and pain refractory to conventional analgesics for 12 weeks, as well as with pain severity, self-rated as 5 on a NRS. Patients who had been treated with pregabalin within the previous 12 weeks and patients regularly treated with nerve blocks were excluded. Patients were treated in routine clinical practice for 8 weeks, and received either pregabalin-containing treatments (pain treatment with pregabalin with or without other analgesics) or usual care (pain treatment with conventional analgesics such as NSAIDs, weak opioids, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs only). As a non-interventional study, all treatment decisions were made at the discretion of physicians, and the choices of pain medications were made independently of their decisions to enroll the patients in the study.
Of the 369 patients enrolled, 145 received pregabalincontaining treatments, and 224 continued the usual care. The pregabalin group contained more male and younger patients than the usual care group (proportion of male, 53.1% versus 30.4%; mean age, 58.3 years versus 66.4 years). At baseline, patients in the pregabalin group had a shorter pain duration

(mean ± standard deviation (SD) duration, 28.8 ± 38.6 months versus 37.1 ± 50.9 months) and slightly higher pain NRS scores (mean ± SD scores, 6.1 ± 1.2 versus 5.8 ± 1.1). Pain medications used among the usual care group at baseline were mainly NSAIDs (89.3% of patients used), which were also commonly used among patients in the pregabalin group (93.1% of patients used at baseline).
Of these 369 patients, 20 patients who dropped out or discontinued treatment for reasons other than adverse events were excluded from data extraction for this costeffectiveness analysis. Patients who discontinued treatment for adverse events were included in data extraction, which was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness considering the unfavorable impacts of treatment. Consequently, this analysis included 138 patients in the pregabalin group and 211 patients in the usual care group (Figure 2). Among these, seven in the pregabalin group and one in the usual care group discontinued treatment because of adverse events.
Model Inputs
Pain Severity And Transition Probabilities The initial distribution of severity categories was calculated based on pain NRS scores at baseline among all patients

irrespective of treatment group as follows: moderate pain (77.1%) and severe pain (22.9%). Transition probability for the initial two months was derived from the actual transition between pain severity categories from week 0 to week 4 (for month 1) and from week 4 to week 8 (for month 2) for each treatment group in the observational study. The discontinuation rates were also derived from the actual rates of discontinuation due to adverse events, and set as 5.1% for the pregabalin group and 0.5% for the usual care group. Table 1 shows all the model inputs used in the model, including probability inputs.
Costs (Medical Costs And Productivity Losses) In this cost-effectiveness analysis, the evaluation from the healthcare payer's perspective considered only medical costs and the evaluation from the societal perspective considered both medical costs and productivity losses. Costs were expressed in Japanese Yen (JPY) (JPY 100 = USD 0.89, as of September 20, 2018).
Medical costs considered included costs of pregabalin, other pain medications, and physical therapy (Table 1), and these costs were calculated based on data obtained in the observational study. For pain medications other than

pregabalin, the following four classes were considered, and costs were calculated using the prices of drugs shown in parentheses, each of which was chosen as the representative drug of the respective classes in Japan: NSAIDs (loxoprofen sodium hydrate), antidepressants (duloxetine hydrochloride), antiepileptic drugs (gabapentin), and weak opioids (tramadol hydrochloride and tramadol hydrochloride/acetaminophen) (each drug cost per day is provided in Table S1). Costs of physical therapy were calculated according to the medical fee points (1 point = JPY 10). A list of physical therapy procedures and respective medical fee points is provided in Table S2.
The health-related work productivity losses were assessed with the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health V2.2 (WPAI: GH) in the observational study. The WPAI: GH is a 6-item questionnaire that quantitatively assesses both absenteeism (workdays missed) and presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work) due to health problems.22 This instrument is considered suitable for direct translation of productivity losses into a monetary figure.23 Absenteeism and overall productivity losses (both absenteeism and presenteeism) were estimated using the formula provided by Lofland et al.23 The amount of wages used for calculation were based on mean monthly income in Japan.24 The absolute levels of absenteeism were low in all severity categories (rate of work time lost due to absenteeism were: 1.0%, 0.2%, and 0.03% in no/mild, moderate, and severe pain, respectively), and patients with severe pain had the lowest absenteeism (mean ± SD costs, JPY 149 ± 942). In contrast, the levels of overall productivity losses were higher in patients with more severe pain (18.9%, 20.1%, and 24.5% in no/mild, moderate, and severe pain, respectively), with patients with severe pain having the highest overall productivity losses (JPY 68,284 ± 110,810). As absenteeism was not likely to be a main driver for productivity losses, the present

analysis considered the costs of overall productivity losses for the evaluation from the societal perspective. The cost values used in the model are shown in Table 1.
Utility The EuroQol five-dimensional, five-level (EQ-5D-5L) index values,25 derived by the conversion of a patient's responses to the 5-item descriptive system of the EQ-5D-5L to a single index value,26 were used to determine the utility value of each health state. The five items of the EQ-5D-5L assess mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/ depression, each of which is rated on a 5-point scale.25 Using a regression equation including all combinations of pain NRS score and sex, and average age of all patients (64.0 years), utility values for each pain NRS score per sex were computed. After calculating the weighted-average utility values for each pain NRS score using a sex ratio of the Japanese population at an average age, the average utility values for each pain severity category were computed as follows: 0.854 for no/mild pain, 0.738 for moderate pain, and 0.622 for severe pain (Table 1). Based on the utility values, a disutility value of transitioning to a more severe pain category was determined as -0.116.
Cost-Effectiveness
Using the estimated costs and QALYs, the ICER was calculated using the following formula:
ICER ¼ Costs pregabalin group À Costs usual care group QALYs pregabalin group À QALYs usual care group
Scenario And Sensitivity Analyses
To assess the robustness of the results, scenario and sensitivity analyses were conducted from the healthcare payer's perspective. In the scenario analyses, the model assumed

different scenarios from the base case: 1) an alternative initial distribution of severity categories (all patients started with moderate pain, or all started with severe pain), and 2) a different time horizon (3 or 24 months).
The uncertainties of the model parameters were also assessed through a series of one-way sensitivity analyses, by varying key variables using the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The parameters considered included utility, disutility for transitioning to a more severe pain category, initial distribution probability of pain severity categories, discontinuation rates, transition probability of pain severity categories, pregabalin costs, other pain medication costs, and physical therapy costs. Furthermore, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was also performed, in which cost, utility, and probability parameters were simultaneously varied by randomly sampling these values, per model iteration, from the distribution assigned for each parameter for 10,000 iterations. Cost parameters were assigned a gamma distribution, and utility and probability parameters were assigned a beta distribution. The ranges and distributions of disutilities in these sensitivity analyses were calculated based on the bootstrapping method, with consideration of co-variance between intercept and coefficient of pain NRS scores in the regression analysis using the Cholesky decomposition method. The obtained 10,000 pairs of incremental costs and QALYs based on probabilistic sensitivity analysis were plotted on a cost-effectiveness plane.

Results Pain Severity
Figure 3 shows the simulated results of the distribution of patients with each pain severity category for the initial two months. A greater increase in the proportion of patients with no/mild pain was shown in patients receiving pregabalin-containing treatments than in patients receiving usual care alone, with 41.6% and 14.5% of patients in respective groups resulting in having no/mild pain after 8 weeks.
Base Case Analyses
The estimations of the costs and QALYs for base case scenarios are presented in Table 2. In the analysis from the payer's perspective, pregabalin-containing treatments resulted in a higher QALY than usual care alone (by 0.036), with additional costs of JPY 35,350, primarily for pregabalin acquisition. This resulted in the ICER of JPY 970,314 per QALY gained. The analyses from the societal perspective also considered productivity losses (both absenteeism and presenteeism). The productivity losses were JPY 18,653 less in the pregabalin group than in the usual care group, which largely offset the pregabalin costs, and resulted in the ICER of JPY 458,307 per QALY gained.

all had severe pain, the analyses respectively resulted in the ICERs of JPY 1,073,627 and JPY 754,236 per QALY gained; both did not greatly deviate from the base case. The ICER varied more when an alternative time horizon was assumed, and resulted in the increased ICER of JPY 1,657,158 per QALY gained when the time horizon was shortened to 3 months.
The one-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated quite small variations in the ICERs for various costs, utility, and

probability parameters, with the ICERs varying within the narrow range from JPY 800,000 to JPY 1,200,000 per QALY gained, even for the top 5 influential parameters (Figure 4). The highest ICER of JPY 1,151,479 per QALY gained was observed when disutility between no/mild pain and moderate pain was varied, and yet it was still similar to the result of the base case (JPY 970,314 per QALY gained).

sensitivity analysis. This cost-effectiveness plane showed that all samples were in the upper right quadrant with relatively small dispersion. The probability that pregabalin-containing treatments are cost-effective was 100% at a hypothetical threshold value of one additional QALY of JPY 5,000,000.27
Discussion
In Japan, the indication of pregabalin has expanded since its launch in 2010,12 and it has become widely used among people with various NeP conditions, including those associated with cervical radiculopathy and cervical myelopathy.

To our knowledge, this was the first cost-effectiveness analysis of pregabalin for the treatment of chronic cervical pain with a NeP component, and the results showed that using pregabalin, either alone or in addition to other analgesics, was cost-effective for the treatment of patients with this NeP condition in Japan, compared with pain treatment only with conventional analgesics.
From the payer's perspective, the estimated ICER was JPY 970,314 per QALY gained, which was lower than those in previous studies reporting the cost-effectiveness of pregabalin for refractory or peripheral NeP.15,28,29 From the societal perspective, the ICER was substantially lowered to JPY

458,307 per QALY gained because the reduced productivity losses by pregabalin-containing treatments offset the pregabalin costs by almost half. In patients with chronic pain, presenteeism greatly contributes to their productivity losses and causes a substantial economic burden on patients.30,31 A Japanese study previously reported that among 34 health conditions, neck pain or stiff shoulders contributed the most to costs of presenteeism in Japan.32 The use of pregabalin for the management of patients with neck pain with a NeP component may serve to reduce some of this large burden.
The scenario and sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the result of the base case analysis. The ICER was somewhat sensitive to the time horizon, which resulted in the increased ICER of 1,657,158 per QALY gained within the 3-month time horizon. However, the gap with the base case was no more than JPY 700,000 per QALY gained, and the value is well below the estimated willingness to pay for one additional QALY in Japan (JPY 5,000,0006,750,000).27,33 Additionally, one-way sensitivity analyses showed that ICERs varied within only a narrow range, which indicates the stability of ICERs for various costs, utility, and probabilistic parameters. Furthermore, our probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that if the hypothetical threshold value of JPY 5,000,000, based on the above-mentioned willingness to pay in Japan, is an appropriate threshold value for one additional QALY, pregabalin-containing treatments would be cost-effective with a probability of 100%. As the ICERs estimated in this analysis are also well below the commonly-referenced thresholds in other countries, such as EUR 20,00030,000 in the UK (EUR 1.0 = JPY 131.11)34 and USD 50,000100,000 in the US (USD 1.0 = JPY 112.32),35 pregabalin-containing treatments can be considered as highly cost-effective for this NeP condition in Japan.
In the base case, starting pregabalin resulted in 0.036 higher QALY gain than usual care alone, probably reflecting the favorable effects of pregabalin for improvement of pain, function, and sleep disturbance.14,36 Although the observed QALY gain seemed rather small, this may be in part because of the non-fatal nature of the condition and the short time horizon of the model. However, the potential clinical benefits of pregabalin are apparent from the results of our simulation showing the greater increase in the proportion of patients with no or mild pain after two months (+41.6%) than in usual care alone (+14.5%) (see Figure 3). The proportion of patients with severe pain would be reduced more greatly with pregabalin-containing treatments in two months than with usual care alone

(-15.6% versus -7.1%). These results suggest a substantial clinical benefit of pregabalin-containing treatments for this patient population. In this analysis, we did not go further in examining which component of QOL (whether improvement of physical function, alleviation of pain, or change in mental state) contributed the most to the QALY gain. These topics are worth investigating in future studies to obtain a deeper understanding of the clinical benefits of pregabalin.
Comparing our results with a previous parallel costeffectiveness analysis of pregabalin for chronic low back pain with a NeP component16 implied a difference in potential treatments between the two pain conditions. Despite similar QALYs of the pregabalin groups in two analyses (cervical pain: 0.763 versus low back pain: 0.766), the incremental QALYs gained by pregabalin-containing treatments were larger in the present analysis than in the low back pain analysis (0.036 versus 0.014, respectively), reflecting the slightly lower QALYs in the usual care group in the present analysis (0.727 versus 0.752, respectively). These results suggest that patients with chronic cervical pain with a NeP component may be more difficult to manage without pregabalin, compared with those with low back pain with a NeP component. One possible explanation is that relative to chronic low back pain, which often involves both nociceptive and neuropathic pain mechanisms (that is, mixed pain37) for which a combination of medications for both pain types is suggested,38,39 mixed pain may be less likely among patients with chronic cervical pain, and thus there may have been fewer patients who benefited from medications for nociceptive pain such as NSAIDs. Considering these, once the involvement of NeP is identified in patients with chronic neck pain, physicians may first need to consider prescribing pregabalin because otherwise, pain control may be difficult to achieve.
One major strength of this cost-effectiveness analysis lies in the use of patient-level outcome data from a realworld clinical setting, which contributed to a better generalization of the results to routine clinical practice in Japan. However, this analysis also has several limitations. In the observational study, to avoid bias in patients included in each treatment group, patients were enrolled after they were prescribed pain medications, and all eligible patients who agreed to participate during the 1-year enrollment period were enrolled. Despite these efforts, because all treatment choices were made by physicians based on their clinical judgment, the potential for bias

2794

still cannot be eliminated; for example, physicians may have been more likely to prescribe pregabalin to patients with greater pain, which was suggested by the slightly higher pain NRS scores at baseline in the pregabalin group. Given that pregabalin was more commonly used among patients with severe pain, which may be more difficult to control than mild pain, the cost-effectiveness of pregabalin-containing treatments may be underestimated in this analysis. As another example, the pregabalin group contained more male and younger patients than the usual care group, probably because physicians avoided prescribing pregabalin to frail elderly patients in consideration of the potential risks of falls and fractures associated with pregabalin's adverse effects such as dizziness. In this analysis, however, to estimate the improvement of pain by each treatment, we set the distributions of pain severity and QOL at baseline to be the same in the two groups. Also, the propensity for pain improvement does not depend on age and sex. Therefore, we reasoned that the age and sex differences would not affect the results of this analysis. Another limitation is that medical costs included only limited elements and not all healthcare costs (such as surgery or hospitalization costs) were considered in this analysis, on the assumption that the cases potentially requiring such additional healthcare utilization were expected to be equally rare in both groups. The observational study enrolled patients in stable conditions; thus, surgery or hospital admission for their symptoms of pain would not be anticipated in these patients, irrespective of group. Additionally, this analysis did not consider treatment costs for adverse events of pregabalin because additional treatments are not required for the management of its common adverse events such as dizziness and somnolence; these adverse events are managed by discontinuing pregabalin even when they are serious, although they are mostly non-serious. Thus, we posit that including some additional medical costs would not likely result in a tremendous rise in the ICER and reach an opposite conclusion; nevertheless, we should acknowledge that an analysis which included these costs would result in a different ICER. Third, we calculated work productivity losses using the WPAI, but the calculation method cannot account for the work productivity loss of individuals who do not have a paid job, meaning that a loss of work productivity of someone without a job because of severe pain was not included in our calculations. As such, the estimated costs of productivity losses depend on the

estimation method, which should be considered when interpreting these results.
Conclusion
For the first time, this analysis provided evidence that using pregabalin, either alone or along with other analgesics, was cost-effective for the treatment of patients with chronic cervical pain with a NeP component in Japan, with the ICERs well below the commonly-referenced thresholds for cost-effectiveness. The cost-effectiveness of pregabalin was further strengthened when productivity losses (both absenteeism and presenteeism) were included. The results of this analysis underscore the benefits of pregabalin for this NeP condition, which may help pregabalin become a more common treatment option in the management of these patients.

Editorial
'May you live in interesting times'; thus runs a Chinese curse. We certainly do live in interesting times. All over the world, standards, perceptions and expectations are changing with increasing speed. This can make us insecure, anxious, frustrated, even angry. At home, we are concerned with what is happening in the NHS and in education. Specifically, we worry how these changes will effect our clinical work, our responsibilities to teach and train the doctors of the future, and our opportunities for research. And so, perhaps, many of us feel that living at an interesting time is indeed a curse.
But there are many things of consuming interest in medicine from which we may take heart. The managerial changes in the NHS are generally not much to our liking. But they have stimulated an interest in management and administration that we had previously rather disdained. In the long run we may well recover the responsibilities we have lost by default.
The public's perception of doctors and its expectations of medical care have changed radically in the last few years. We are now engaged
in a debate on how health care should be delivered and how the
priorities for its delivery should be assessed. These requirements, coming more or less at the same time as some of the most remarkable advances in medical science, have raised interesting ethical issues, and have heightened the profession's awareness of the public's preferences and prejudices.
The financial constraints under which Universities and Research
Councils are forced to operate, have awakened an interest in finding new and novel sources of support. Sir James Gowans, in last year's Harveian Oration at the Royal College of Physicians, said: 'those who are involved in medical research, could not be living at a more exciting time.' However, the prospects for medical research depend not only on scientific opportunity and talent but also on the resources available to exploit it. The problems facing academic medicine are well rehearsed in David Shaw's thoughtful editorial. The excitement of research and its application to clinical practice is revealed in the range of articles in this issue of the Journal: not only research employing methods of advanced technology but also those of accurate clinical observation and good record keeping in simple surroundings.
The evidence, in many parts of the world, of man's inhumanity to man, and of Nature's apparent cruelty (abetted by man's stupidity and greed) has prompted an interest, especially among the younger doctors and nurses, in the fate of human beings on a world-wide scale. Many have been prepared to risk life, torture and imprisonment to bring help to people in desperate need. Surely, their example should give us fresh hope for the future.
'May you live in interesting times': it is a challenge, not a curse.

In response
I am sure many, perhaps most, readers of the Journal will have enjoyed Stuart Horner's article in this issue of the Journal Manager-bashing is fun (another good way to annoy us is to call us 'administrators').
I have sympathy with Dr Horner's frustration at managers who take arbitrary decisions. Continual overstatement of his case, however, weakens its effect. The most bizarre example is the suggestion that 'Doctors admitting emergencies to their hospitals aren't really trying if their patients have not achieved between five and nine episodes within 24 hours of

The management myth

admission'. My authority keeps a close eye on the admissions/episodes ratio, and was the first to publish evidence of abuse; but for most of our trusts the ratio
is about 1:1.07 that is 7 extra episodes per 100 admissions. Perhaps my local hospital doctors aren't
really trying? Dr Horner presents what he describes as a series of
myths, moving readily between those believed by NHS managers and those by managers in other sectors. His basic proposition is that the NHS is different in kind, and that supermarket management will not work in the complex relationship between clinicians and patients. I agree, and argued the same point with an
MP on the Public Accounts Committee who wanted to
know why NHS operations were any different from a car's trip to the garage. His secondary proposition is that there are flaws in the managerial ethos, wherever it is practised in this country (in sharp distinction, it Would seem, from the tiger economies of the Pacific Rim, which had the good sense to model themselves on the 1974 NHS consensus model).
The problem with Dr Horner's analysis, apart from its partiality, is its narrow concept of managers. Apart from distinguishing theory Y from theory X managers, (the former, among whom I count myself, are apparently like red squirrels being overrun by grey) Dr Horner generalises excessively. In reality, managers, whether in the NHS or elsewhere, are no more
homogenous entities from the production lines of Henley, Ashridge or the London Business School than
patients are like Ford cars. For that matter, NHS con-
sultants and GPs, notwithstanding the efforts of their professional bodies, display individuality on a scale which any NHS manager ignores at peril. And for all their diversity, the most successful clinicians and managers are those who understand the need to work together - not in the outmoded 1974 consensus model, but in true collaboration based on respect.
In my view Dr Horner only partly addresses three key issues. First, resources, whether of money or personnel, are finite, and there will always need to be a managerial process to match finite supply with demand, just as there will always need to be a process whereby society determines what share of the common Wealth to allocate to health. Secondly, many of the drivers for change in health care are coming not from managers but from clinicians; the Audit Commission did not invent the proposition that the number of A&E Departments be reduced, but endorsed a clinical opinion on minimum size. Lastly, he fails to draw out the extent to which the much-derided analogy with
Sainsburys may have become a reality. A vast amount
of information about the NHS, much of which is
meaningful, is now available at the centre sufficiently quickly for 'headquarters' managers to know what is going on and to intervene in ways which may well reduce the responsibility of local management. The NHS's bankers, the Treasury, also have these data, and that opportunity.

Clinicians and managers at local level face an
increasing need to agree about the best ways of using public resources. If we do not, others will presume to
instruct us all. JOHN JAMES ChiefExecutive

It is an interesting new myth that post-1974 consensus
management in the NHS has similarities with
the paternalistic, collaborative but fundamentally authoritarian corporate cultures of Japan, Korea and the Chinese diaspora. Consensus management is, in fact, a uniquely British eccentricity. Its theoretical
foundation derived from the work of Wilfred Brown
and Elliot Jacques in an unusual alliance with McKinsey 8c Co. Wilfred Brown was an exponent of industrial democracy with a powerful mix of philanthropy in the very British tradition of Owen, Rowntree and the John Lewis Partnership. His long time collaborator Elliot Jacques was a psychoanalyst who developed a very elaborate theoretical structure to describe social relationships at work. Wilfred Brown's Glacier Metal Company did not survive the terrible economic onslaught of the 1980s, and neither did NHS consensus management.
Developments in management of the health services in the 1980s and 1990s have, to a large extent, simply been of a piece with developments in society more widely.
Government in the 1980s asserted its political will over public services generally, including professional
services such as health and education. Administrators or managers on short-term contracts, whose livelihood
in the end depends on political or quasi-political patronage, have been an important instrument to deliver government policy. The barons of the public services and professions have all had cause to feel, from time to time, as 'conquered peoples of a once-
great civilisation'.
Performance management of public services and demands for professionals to be more accountable have been a general feature of the last decade. We can deride Charter standards. We all know how simplistic measures can be manipulated. Micro-management of waiting lists or waiting times is irksome and difficult. Nevertheless, very long waiting lists for elective admission have, in fact, disappeared and the vast majority of outpatients do see a doctor within a short period of the appointment time. I cannot think that has been a bad development.
Is it really all that unreasonable to ask a consultant to say when he or she is available for operating lists, ward rounds or outpatient clinics and to let other people know if his or her schedule has to be altered? That is what a job plan does.

Forum

McGregor's theory X and theory Y were taught when I went to business school in 1969. McGregor favoured theory Y. He was part of a school of thought which became known as the 'human potential movement'. McGregor's writing was very much part of the optimistic 1960s, when it was bliss to be alive and to be young was very heaven. If McGregor is still taught in business schools I would be surprised if theory Y has been found to be a very good working model for industries which are downsizing and outsourcing as
the NHS has been for the last decade.
A better theory of organisation, contingency theory, suggests that different ways and styles of organisation are needed to respond effectively to different circumstances. General management was an effective
response to the needs of the 1980s. It was a harsh
prescription for harsh times. Later, the NHS reforms of the early 1990s were the expression in the health
service of a much wider social movement to increase
the power of consumers in relation to suppliers, including suppliers of professional services, and to mimic the dynamic of markets within public sector
organisations. An enterprise which consumes more than ?30
billion annually needs to be run in a business-like way, and be able to demonstrate that to its paymasters. We often try to count things that are very difficult to
count, and get it wrong. But the NHS cannot avoid
having to account for the vast amount of money it has to spend. Nor can we avoid responding to the domi-
nant social trends of the times we are in. But in the
drive to be more business-like it can easily be forgotten
that health services are not a business.
For me, the most illuminating writer on organisation is Amitai Etzioni, who defined hospitals, along with schools, universities and the church, as 'normative organisations'. Normative organisations are vehicles for custody and transmission of a society's fundamental values. The leadership of a normative

organisation rests de facto with the leading priests, teachers or doctors who embody the values and knowledge which are the purposes of the organisation. Key to effective management or administration of the economic aspects of such an organisation is that the administrator/manager has internalised its values and recognises the charismatic leadership of the practitioners.
General management in the NHS did fail to acknowledge these fundamentally important differences between management in industry and management in health services, although I think successful general managers all understood the difference. The market reforms of the NHS have stimulated many real improvements in service for patients and in efficiency, but do threaten to subvert the values of the health service.
Management is certainly not value neutral - nothing is. Managers and professionals need to share the same values. We cannot escape the economic, social or political realities of the times in which we live. Management is not a scholarly pursuit, and evidence based management is no more widely practised than evidence-based medicine. Nevertheless, in the modern world management is necessary. It need not be an evil.

Abstract. Mammalian oocyte quality degrades over time after ovulation in vitro, which can cause fatal defects such as chromosomal aneuploidy. As various oocyte manipulations employed in assisted reproductive technology are time consuming, post-ovulatory aging is a serious problem to overcome in reproductive medicine or ova research. In this study, we investigated the effects of postovulatory aging on the incidence of chromosome aneuploidy during meiosis II, with a focus on the expression of functional proteins from the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Chromosome analysis was used to assess the rate of aneuploidy in in vitro aged oocytes, or in early embryos derived from aged oocytes. Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect the localization of MAD2, which is a SAC signal that monitors the correct segregation of sister chromatids. Immunoblotting was used to quantify cohesin subunits, which are adhesion factors connecting sister chromatids at the metaphase II (MII) centromere. It was shown that post-ovulatory oocyte aging inhibits MAD2 localization to the sister kinetochore. Furthermore, oocyte aging prevented cohesin subunits from being maintained or degraded at the appropriate time. These data suggest that the destabilization of SAC signaling causes sister chromatid segregation errors in MII oocytes, and consequently increases the incidence of aneuploidy in early embryos. Our findings have provided distinct evidence that the post-ovulatory aging of oocytes might also be a risk factor for aneuploidy, irrespective of maternal age.

In recent years, the importance of oocyte aging in reproductive health has been widely acknowledged. Oocyte aging leads to alterations to cytoplasmic organelles at the molecular level, and has a negative impact on embryo or fetal development after fertilization. Various kinds of alterations, such as a functional deterioration of mitochondria [1, 2], failed intracellular calcium control by endoplasmic reticulum [3, 4], and abnormalities in genomic imprinting mechanisms [5, 6] have previously been reported. These alterations, caused by oocyte aging, have often been considered signs of deterioration in oocyte quality. It is well known that chromosomal aneuploidy is a consequence of functional loss caused by oocyte aging [7-9]. Chromosomal aneuploidy in oocytes, which is a major cause of decreased developmental competence and loss of pregnancy [8-13], is caused by chromosomal segregation errors, such as early segregation and non-disjunction during meiosis. Recent molecular research into chromosomal instability has progressed rapidly, and advanced the general understanding.
Spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which functions during cell division, is one of the checkpoint mechanisms functional during the cell cycle. SAC is a monitoring system, which equally distributes chromosomes by correctly attaching spindle microtubules to the

chromosome kinetochore [14, 15] (Fig. 1). MAD2, which binds with MAD1 on the chromosome kinetochore, monitors the connection between the microtubule of the spindle fiber and the kinetochore. When there is a kinetochore that is not fully connected to a spindle fiber, MAD2 localizes and sends a signal to inhibit the progression of anaphase [16]. This signal is released when the chromosomes are attached with spindle microtubules and aligned on the equatorial plane. Cohesin, a multiprotein complex that is a component of SAC, acts as an adhesion factor to keep homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids together until the completion of meiosis I and II, respectively [17]. In mammals, meiotic cohesin complexes consist of four evolutionarily conserved protein subunits: two members of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family (SMC1 and SMC3), a member of the Kleisin family (REC8), and stromal antigen (SA) subunit (SA3). SMC proteins, which constitute a core subunit of the cohesin complex, regulate higher-order chromosome structure and function. REC8, which contains a cleavage recognition site for separase, has a role in maintenance of chromosome cohesion with SA3 [18] and SMC proteins. Chromosome cohesion, mediated by cohesin proteins, which form a ring-like protein structure, is established at the chromosome centromere and along the chromosome arms [17, 18]. The release of SAC induces a degradation of cyclin B and securin, which follows the activation of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which serves as an ubiquitin ligase. CDC20, which is an APC/C activator, inhibits the activity of APC/C to form a M-phase checkpoint complex with MAD2 and BubR1 [15]. Securin is a separase inhibitor protein and its ubiquitination by APC/C promotes cohesin detachment following the activation of separase, which subsequently induces segregation of homologous

Summary of the molecular mechanism of spindle assembly checkpoint. MAD2, which binds with MAD1 on the kinetochore, monitors the connection between a spindle fiber and kinetochore. The MAD1-MAD2 complex serves as a catalyst to promote binding between a free MAD2 and CDC20. The MAD2-CDC20 complex forms a M-phase checkpoint complex (MCC) with other functional proteins, and suppresses the activity of APC/C. A fully connected spindle fiber on the kinetochore interrupts the signal from the spindle checkpoint. CDC20, released from MCC, behaves as an APC/C activator by binding with APC/C. Activated APC/C promotes ubiquitination of securin, which regulates separase activity. The separase activated by securin degradation cleaves REC8, which is contained in the cohesin complex. Finally, sister chromatids lose cohesin, an adhesion factor, and are segregated by tension from the spindle fiber.

chromosomes and sister chromatids (Fig. 1) [17]. Many reports suggest the relation between oocyte aging and SAC
processes, including chromosome cohesion [19-25]. In humans, the inter-kinetochore distance between sister chromatids significantly increases in oocytes as maternal age advances, suggesting that sister chromatid cohesion has weakened [20, 23]. Expression of meiosisspecific REC8, a cohesin subunit, has also been shown to decrease as maternal age advances [19, 23]. It is suggested that these factors cause incidences of unpaired sister chromatids and early chromatid segregation, leading to the induction of aneuploidy. Most studies investigating chromosome segregation errors that occur during meiosis I focus on the effect of pre-ovulatory maternal age [7, 9, 19-22]. To gain insight into oocyte aging, the aging process needs to be considered on two different axes of time. One is maternal aging, which involves an inter-annual change in oocytes that advances with age. This is also described as pre-ovulatory aging, which progresses in the ovary. The other is post-ovulatory aging, or the temporal alterations in oocytes that have been induced to ovulate by ovarian stimulation in response to a luteinizing hormone or a chorionic hormone. Post-ovulatory aging progresses in the oviduct or can be induced in vitro. Although mature oocytes arrested at metaphase II (MII) fertilize immediately after ovulation, the optimal time of fertilization (fertilization window) varies depending on the species

[8]. If fertilization is not completed successfully during the ideal fertilization window, the ovulated oocytes will be retained in the oviduct, or cultivated in a culture dish. The quality of these unfertilized oocytes deteriorates in a time-dependent manner [8]. As the in vitro manipulation time for ovulated oocytes used in reproductive medicine and ova research lengthens, post-ovulatory oocyte aging would become a problem that must be overcome.
This study aims to investigate chromosomal aneuploidy induced by post-ovulatory aging during meiosis II, with a focus on chromosomal segregation errors and expression of functional SAC proteins.
Materials and Methods
Animals ICR male (10-15 weeks old) and female (8-10 weeks old) mice
were used for experiments described below. The mice were maintained under controlled light conditions (14 h light from 0600 h to 2000 h; 10 h dark) and temperature (24 ± 2°C). All procedures involving animal experiments were conducted according to guidelines approved by the Animal Research Committee of Tokyo University of Agriculture.
Oocyte collection and in vitro aging To obtain MII oocytes, female mice were induced to super-ovulate

by consecutive injection of 5 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (ASKA Animal Health, Tokyo, Japan) and 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; ASKA Animal Health) at 48 h intervals. The super-ovulated mice were euthanized 15 h after the hCG injection, and the oviductal ampullae were broken to release the cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) into TYH medium under paraffin liquid (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). The collected COCs were incubated for a certain time at 37.5°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and used as in vitro aged oocytes. In this study, two experimental groups were designated. One was an aged group, where oocytes incubated for 6 or 12 h in vitro after oocyte collection were examined. The other was a fresh group, which functioned as a control, where oocytes were immediately examined after collection.
Oocyte activation Oocytes were freed from cumulus cells by brief exposure to 0.1%
hyaluronidase (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA) in Hepesbuffered CZB medium (H-CZB) at 37.5°C, followed by washes and subsequent activation treatment. The denuded oocytes were incubated in activating medium for 1 h at 37.5°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Ca2+-free H-CZB supplemented with 10 mM strontium chloride (SrCl2, Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) was used as activating medium. After the SrCl2 treatment, oocytes were incubated in normal H-CZB. Six hours after the onset of activation treatment with SrCl2, oocytes with one pronucleus were considered activated, and were examined for chromosome analysis or immunoblotting.
In vitro fertilization (IVF) To perform chromosome analysis at the 8-cell stage, IVF was
performed using COCs obtained from oviductal ampullae. Before insemination, spermatozoa were collected from one cauda epididymis and pre-cultured in TYH medium for 1.5 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Insemination was performed with a final sperm concentration of 1 × 105/ml in a droplet of TYH medium. After co-incubation for six hours, oocytes with two distinct pronuclei and a second polar body were considered fertilized. These fertilized oocytes were transferred into a droplet of KSOM medium supplemented with essential and non-essential amino acids (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) (mKSOM), and were then cultured for 56 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Some of these embryos were maintained in culture for up to 96 h in order to assess developmental capacity.
Chromosome analysis Chromosome analysis was performed on both oocytes and 8-cell
stage embryos. To eliminate the male genome factor, chromosome analysis of oocytes was performed after activating treatment by SrCl2 without fertilization. After the activation treatment, oocytes were cultured in mKSOM for 20 h. Six hours before termination of the culture, the activated oocytes were treated with mKSOM supplemented with 0.1 g/ml demecolcine (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Chromosome spreads were prepared according to the method reported by Yoshizawa et al. [26, 27], with slight modification. The slides were stained for 15 min with 4% Giemsa solution (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Stained chromosome spreads were observed with an optical microscope and

the number of chromosomes was counted. Chromosome spreads with more or less than 40 chromosomes, or showing polyploidy, were considered as numerical chromosome aberrations (NCAs). Some 8-cell embryos, which were cultured for 56 h after IVF, were also examined for chromosome analysis with a similar method.
Immunofluorescent staining The morphological observation of spindles and the localization
analysis of MAD2 protein in MII oocytes were performed using immunofluorescent staining. To detect normal MAD2 localization on the chromosome kinetochore, oocytes were incubated in mKSOM supplemented with 20 µg/ml nocodazole (Sigma), as an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization, for 30 min at 37°C. The zona pellucida was removed from the oocytes with washes in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) containing 0.5% pronase (Merck Millipore) for 5 min at 37°C, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Wako) in D-PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After fixation, the oocytes were treated with 1% TritonX-100 (Wako) in D-PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and were washed three times with D-PBS. The permeabilized oocytes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing thrice with D-PBS, the oocytes were incubated with goat anti-MAD2 antibody (1:50 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) as a primary antibody over night at 4°C and then washed three times with D-PBS. This was followed by incubation in Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen) for 60 min. After washing thrice with D-PBS, the oocytes were incubated with mouse anti--Tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution, Sigma) as a primary antibody for 60 min at room temperature, washed thrice with D-PBS, then incubated in fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution, Sigma) as a secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Oocyte chromosomes were stained with 0.1 g/ml 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma) for 30 min at 4°C. Following washing, the oocytes were mounted on glass slides, covered with glass cover slips, and observed under 200-400 times magnification using a fluorescence microscope system, BX51 and DP71 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Immunoblotting The expression of cohesin subunits and functional proteins of
SAC was detected in activated or non-activated (MII) oocytes using immunoblotting. Forty oocytes per tube were lysed in RIPA buffer (Wako) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Yokohama, Japan) and incubated on ice for 10 min. After being centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, the oocyte lysates were frozen at -80°C until use. The oocyte lysates were diluted with an equal volume of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (Wako) and heated to 100°C for 5 min. Proteins were separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with a stacking gel containing 4% acrylamide (Wako) and a separating gel containing 7.5~10% acrylamide run for 50 min at 200 V. Proteins were then electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) for 30 min at 15 V. Each membrane was blocked with PVDF blocking reagent

The membranes were washed thrice with PBS-T and proteins were detected using an ECL Prime western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare). After detection of target proteins, the membranes were washed twice and re-blocked. As an internal control, the expression of -actin was detected as described above using mouse anti--actin antibody (1:1,000 dilution, Wako) as a primary antibody and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:4,000 dilution, GE Healthcare). ImageJ was used to quantify the intensity of the protein bands of interest, and band intensities were normalized to an internal control.
Statistical analysis The Chi-square test was used to determine the statistical significance
of the percentages of activation, fertilization, development, and NCAs. The Tukey-Kramer test of multiple comparison following one-way ANOVA was used to compare the average expression levels of proteins among the groups. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Pronuclear formation after oocyte activation The rates of pronuclear formation in the post-ovulatory aged

oocytes are shown in Table 1. Normal activated oocytes which have one pronucleus were observed in 85.6% (83/97) and 70.1% (82/117) of all treated oocytes in the 6 and 12 h aged groups respectively, and 88.6% (101/114) in the fresh group. The rates of dead oocytes after activation treatment were 5.2% (5/97) and 23.1% (27/117) in the 6 and 12 h aged groups respectively, and the rate of dead oocytes in the 12 h aged group was significantly higher than that in the 6 h aged group and the fresh group (5.3%, 6/114) (P < 0.05).
Preimplantation development after IVF The fertilization and developmental rates in the post-ovulatory aged
oocytes are shown in Table 2. Fertilized oocytes were recognized in 87.7% (200/228) and 78.1% (193/247) of all examined oocytes in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively, and the fertilization rate in the 12 h aged group was lower than that in the 6 h aged group and the fresh group (86.2%, 181/210) (P < 0.05). Embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage were observed in 80.0% (84/105) and 72.6% (82/113) of all cultured embryos in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively, and the developmental rate in the 12 h aged group was lower than that in the fresh group (87.5%, 91/104) (P < 0.05).
Numerical chromosome aberration in oocytes and early embryos The rates of NCAs in the post-ovulatory aged oocytes completing
second meiosis are shown in Fig. 2A. NCAs were detected in 26.2% (11/42) and 40.0% (16/40) of all observed chromosome spreads in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively, and numbers of NCAs in the 12 h aged group were significantly higher than that in the fresh group (17.2%, 5/29) (P < 0.05). Most of the NCAs observed in oocytes indicated aneuploidy (23.8, 40.0% in 6 and 12 h aged groups respectively, and 10.3% in the fresh group). The rates of NCAs in 8-cell embryos derived from the aged oocytes are shown in Fig. 2B. NCAs were detected in 35.6% (36/101) and 51.5% (35/68) of all observed chromosome spreads in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively, and the 12 h aged group had significantly more NCAs

than the 6 h aged and the fresh groups (32.7%, 36/110) (P < 0.05). As with the oocytes, most NCAs discovered in 8-cell embryos indicated aneuploidy (33.7, 44.1% in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively, and 28.2% in the fresh group).
Morphology of MII spindle Chromosome analysis indicated that the NCAs detected in the early

embryos derived from aged oocytes might be attributed to a failure during the chromosomal segregation step of meiosis II. To observe spindle shapes at the MII stage, oocyte spindles were visualized by immunofluorescent staining. The MII spindles of fresh oocytes were barrel-shaped and slightly pointed (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the spindles of aged oocytes were elongated, and the pole width of the spindles was wider than that observed in fresh oocytes (Fig. 3B).

Expression of MAD2 Initially, for the purpose of detecting the normal localization of
MAD2, kinetochores without microtubule connections were produced artificially by blocking the polymerization of microtubules (Fig.

4A). In the MII stage, the spindle of oocytes has a barrel shape, and the spindle fibers retain connections to the kinetochore on the chromosome aligned at the equator. When all kinetochores were fully connected to spindle fibers, the localization of MAD2 to the kinetochore was not observed. MII oocytes, where microtubule polymerization was inhibited by nocodazole treatment, exhibited no microtubule formation, and localized MAD2 expression at the kinetochore was detected. The expression level of MAD2 was shown as a ratio relative to -actin expression. The expression level of MAD2 in the oocytes treated with nocodazole was 0.96 ± 0.13, and there was no difference compared to that observed in control oocytes (0.73 ± 0.12) (Fig. 4B).
Immunofluorescent staining results of MAD2 in 12 h aged oocytes are shown in Fig. 5. Despite the inhibition of spindle fiber connections to kinetochores on the misaligned chromosomes, MAD2 signals were not observed at some kinetochores (Fig. 5A). However, MAD2 localization was detected at kinetochores with fully connected spindles in 12 h aged oocytes (Fig. 5B). These results indicated that the system that monitors the connection between microtubules and kinetochores based on MAD2 localization might be disturbed by oocyte aging. The expression levels of MAD2 in the aged oocytes are shown in Fig. 5C. In non-activated oocytes (MII oocytes), the expression levels of MAD2 were 0.78 ± 0.20, and 0.94 ± 0.11 in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively, and 0.73 ± 0.12 in the fresh group. In activated oocytes, the expression levels of MAD2 were 0.96 ± 0.14, 1.04 ± 0.14 in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively, and

0.89 ± 0.03 in the fresh group. There were no significant differences between the aged groups and the fresh group, irrespective of oocyte activation status.
Expression of cohesin subunits, securin and CDC20 In this study, we assessed the cohesin complex as a terminal
molecule in the SAC mechanism, and as a regulator of sister chromatid separation. The expression levels of SMC1 and SMC3 are shown in Fig. 6A, B, and F. In non-activated oocytes (MII oocytes), the expression levels of SMC1 are shown as a ratio, relative to -actin expression, and were 0.98 ± 0.19 and 1.00 ± 0.39 in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between the aged groups and the fresh group (1.35 ± 0.35). In activated oocytes, the expression levels of SMC1 were 0.73 ± 0.32 and 1.08 ± 0.10 in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively. SMC1 levels in the aged groups were higher than in the fresh group; in particular, there was a significant difference between the 12 h aged group and the fresh group (0.30 ± 0.12, P < 0.05) (Fig. 6A). As for the comparison of expression levels between before and after activation, SMC1 levels after activation were significantly lower than those before activation in fresh oocytes (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference was recognized between before and after activation in the aged oocytes. Concerning SMC3, the expression levels in non-activated oocytes were 1.35 ± 0.26 and 1.13 ± 0.64 in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively, and 1.19 ± 0.38 in the fresh group. The expression levels in activated oocytes were 1.33 ± 0.44 and 1.19 ± 0.64 in the

64

SHIMOI et al.

6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively, and 1.26 ± 0.36 in the fresh group. In contrast to SMC1, the expression levels of SMC3 were not different among groups, regardless of oocyte activation status (Fig. 6B). The expression levels of REC8 are shown in Fig. 6C and F. In non-activated oocytes, expression levels of REC8 were 1.30 ± 0.58 and 1.15 ± 0.21 in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively. The REC8 levels of MII oocytes declined over time in vitro, with a significant difference between the 12 h aged group and the fresh group (1.86 ± 0.56, P < 0.05). In activated oocytes, the expression levels of REC8 were 0.55 ± 0.04 and 1.00 ± 0.03 in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively. The REC8 level in the 12 h aged group was significantly higher than that in the other groups (P < 0.05). Comparing expression levels between before and after activation, REC8 abundance after activation was significantly lower than that before activation in fresh oocytes (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference was identified between before and after activation in aged oocytes.
Expression levels of securin are shown in Fig. 6D and F. In nonactivated oocytes, the expression levels of securin were 0.69 ± 0.10 and 0.77 ± 0.20 in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between the aged groups and the fresh group (0.94 ± 0.17). In activated oocytes, the expression levels of securin were 1.26 ± 0.04 and 2.06 ± 0.30 in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively. Securin levels in activated oocytes increased with age in vitro; there was a significant difference between the aged group and the fresh group (0.39 ± 0.06, P < 0.05). Comparing expression levels between before and after activation, securin levels after activation were significantly lower than before activation in fresh oocytes (P < 0.05). In contrast, securin levels after activation were significantly higher than before activation in the aged group (P < 0.05).
The expression levels of CDC20 are shown in Fig. 6E and F. In non-activated oocytes, the expression levels of CDC20 were 0.87 ± 0.35 and 0.76 ± 0.25 in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively. The CDC20 levels in MII oocytes gradually decreased with age. However, no significant difference was recognized between the aged group and the fresh group (1.11 ± 0.45). In activated oocytes, the expression levels of CDC20 were 0.33 ± 0.16 and 0.23 ± 0.13 in the 6 and 12 h aged groups, respectively. No significant difference was recognized between the aged group and the fresh group (0.34 ± 0.05). Comparing expression levels between before and after activation, CDC20 levels after activation were significantly lower than before activation in all groups (P < 0.05).
Discussion
In our present study, three facts were revealed about the effect of post-ovulatory oocyte aging on meiosis II. First, it was established that NCAs are frequently induced in early embryos derived from in vitro aged oocytes, and these NCAs are due to errors in sister chromatid segregation that occurred during meiosis II. Second, it was shown that abnormalities in MAD2 localization, one of the checkpoint signal molecules that monitor the connections between spindle fiber and kinetochore, were found in aged MII oocytes. Finally, segregation errors were found on sister chromatids, which were attributed to the obstruction of appropriate cohesin subunit

maintenance, and degradation in aged oocytes. Ability of activated oocytes to form pronuclei tended to decrease
with advancing aging time in vitro. The effects of in vitro aging on fertilization and preimplantation development seemed to appear by 12 h at the latest from oocyte collection. These results appeared to reflect the NCA frequencies in aged oocytes, or in embryos derived from aged oocytes, as described later. In this study, approximately 40% of the chromosome spreads analyzed from 8-cell embryos derived from 12 h aged oocytes exhibited aneuploidy (Fig. 2). Additionally, aneuploidy was detected in 12 h aged oocytes, which had completed second meiosis; this occurred at the same frequency as observed in 8-cell embryos. These data suggested that aneuploidy occurred more frequently in embryos derived from in vitro aged oocytes during early development, and that these aneuploidies originated from sister chromatid segregation errors during meiosis II. The major factor causing chromosomal aneuploidy in oocytes is abnormality of chromosome separation during meiosis [28, 29]. Many reports have suggested that failed chromosome distribution is caused by alterations in spindle shape and the misalignment of chromosomes at the equatorial plane in MII oocytes [11, 31, 32]. Normal spindles are barrel-shaped, including chromosomes, which are accurately aligned on the equator in mouse oocytes [8]. It has been indicated that, even when the spindle is normally shaped, it tends to elongate with the progress of aging in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3, aged oocytes obtained in the present study also had elongated spindles, which is consistent with the results of previous reports [30, 32]. Furthermore, some aged oocytes had obscured spindles and misaligned chromosomes, with no spindle fibers connected to the kinetochore. In aged oocytes, microtubules were gradually lost from the spindle, with the greatest loss in the central spindle area near the chromosome [8]. From these facts, it appeared that the obscure spindles and disrupted microtubules were caused by tubulin depolymerization. The poor connection between spindle fiber and chromosome kinetochore caused by microtubule disruption generates a disproportionate tension between the chromatids. In the second meiosis, when the spindle microtubules equally pull the sister kinetochores from the opposite poles, tension is generated between the sister chromatids, and the connection stabilizes [33, 34]. If the microtubules pull the sister kinetochores in the wrong direction, the connection is usually corrected and the sister chromatids are accurately distributed. By activating a checkpoint signal and blocking an advance to anaphase stage, SAC ensures that there is time to correct any connection errors between spindle fiber and kinetochore [35].
When SAC does not respond correctly to an improper connection of the spindle fibers to a kinetochore, the frequency of aneuploidy in aged oocytes may be increased [22, 23, 28, 36]. Thus, it is important to note that abnormalities in the localization of a checkpoint signal molecule were found in aged MII oocytes (Fig. 5). MAD2, which binds with MAD1 on the kinetochore, plays a role in monitoring the connection between spindle fibers and kinetochores [36-38]. MAD2 does not usually appear when connections between spindle fibers and kinetochores occur normally. However, when MII oocytes were treated with nocodazole, which is an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization, MAD2 was detected near the centromere (Fig. 4). In this study, it was revealed that some aged oocytes did not show MAD2 localization on the chromosome kinetochore, despite failed

spindle fiber-kinetochore connections. In contrast, other aged oocytes indicated MAD2 localization at kinetochores with spindle fiber connections. Zhang et al. have reported that MAD2 localization to a chromosome that was out of alignment on the equator might gradually dissipate [39]. Even if several chromosomes lacking a stable kinetochore-microtubule connection exist, these are not enough to prevent the advance to anaphase and the resulting chromosome distribution error [34, 40]. On the other hand, in research using murine or porcine oocytes, it has been reported that the expression level of MAD2 gradually decreased as oocytes aged [36, 41, 42]. Our data showed that there is no significant difference in the expression level of MAD2 between aged and fresh oocytes, regardless of oocyte activation. Because MAD2 exists in a free state, not only in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm [36], data assessing increases or decreases in MAD2 expression do not address MAD2's role as a checkpoint signal. However, based on the combination of MAD2 localization data and expression levels, it is possible to discern a potential age-related dysfunction in the checkpoint system through which MAD2 monitors the kinetochore-microtubule connection.
Previous reports have provided distinct evidence that the deterioration of sister chromatid cohesion was a cause of age-related aneuploidy [21-25, 37]. The cohesin complex serves as an adhesion molecule connecting sister chromatids during chromosome segregation regulated by SAC. REC8, which is a meiosis-specific subunit of cohesin, has a separase recognition site that is specifically cleaved by separase [22]. Thus, the expression of cohesin REC8 is essential to retain proper sister chromatid connections until the terminal phase of chromosome segregation. It is known that Rec8-deficient mice show a loss of synapsis in homologous chromosomes, and poor cohesion of sister chromatids [21]. Even in wild-type mice, it was shown that REC8 gradually reduce on chromosome as mice age [21-23, 25, 43]. Chiang et al. [23] have reported that sister kinetochores in MI and MII oocytes from old mice are not tightly connected. They have also shown that, in oocytes with poor connections between sister kinetochores, REC8 expression levels decreased and sister chromatid cohesion was weakened. In human oocytes, the age-dependent deterioration of cohesin REC8 has been recognized, strongly suggesting an association with premature separation of sister chromatids (PSSC), which is a factor in aneuploidy [43]. Although previous findings are associated with maternal aging, in this study it has been revealed that, even in young mice, the time-dependent deterioration of REC8 occurred in MII oocytes that were aged in vitro after ovulation. Recent reports have suggested that the weak cohesion associated with the age-dependent decrease in REC8 was attributed to a gradual loss of Shugoshin (SGO1 and SGO2), which is a protector of cohesin [22]. In fission yeast, SGO1, which protects the limited cohesin in the centromere region from separase during meiosis I, enables the adhesion of sister chromatids until meiosis II. However, its expression is meiosis I-specific [44, 45], and it has been suggested that SGO2, which is expressed during both meiosis I and II, might be not directly involved in cohesin protection [44]. In mammals, it has been reported that both SGO1 and SGO2 localize around the inner kinetochore in both meiosis I and meiosis II [46]. This report also mentioned that SGO2 is highly expressed in oocytes, whereas expression of SGO1 is moderate. Moreover, analysis of RNA interference against Sgo1 or Sgo2 in MII oocytes

has shown that REC8 is preserved at centromeres in Sgo1-depleted oocytes, but disappears in Sgo2-depleted oocytes. These facts suggest that Sgo2 play a major role in centromere to protect REC8 from cleavage by separase. In fission yeast, it has been proposed that SGO2 localizes Aurora B kinase, which cancels misconnections of kinetochore-spindles, to the centromere and promotes the activation of SAC signals such as the localization of MAD2 to the kinetochore [44, 47]. Thus, the time-dependent deterioration of MII cohesin, and the errors in MAD2 localization in in vitro aged oocytes, might be related to the decrease in SGO2 expression. Our data indicated that post-ovulatory oocyte aging weakens sister chromatid cohesion, and might become a factor of PSSC, causing aneuploidy.
Surprisingly, the expression level of REC8 increased in activated oocytes, depending on aging time, and did not significantly change in aged oocytes after activation, as compared with aged oocytes before activation. The expression level of cohesin REC8 usually decreases promptly after activation. Securin, which is a suppressor of separase, was overexpressed in activated aged oocytes, which may be one of the reasons for disturbing the decrease in REC8. Securin is ubiquitinated in a CDC20-dependent manner via APC/C, and then degraded by proteasomes [48]. In our present study, there was no effect of post-ovulatory oocyte aging on the expression of CDC20, an activator of APC/C, regardless of oocyte activation. On the other hand, as is case with REC8, SMC1 decreased in MII aged oocytes, and did not significantly change in activated aged oocytes, as compared with oocytes before activation. Interestingly, SMC1 is also expressed specifically during meiosis and has been suggested as a potential cause of age-related aneuploidy [21, 22]. It is unclear why only the meiosis-specific subunits were affected by oocyte aging. This study is the first report to find that post-ovulatory aging obstructed cohesin decreases in activated oocytes. Our present data suggested that the maintenance of cohesin REC8 and SMC1 in aged oocytes after activation might lead to non-disjunction of sister chromatids during MII.
In conclusion, it was shown that the post-ovulatory aging of oocytes inhibited MAD2 localization to the kinetochore. Furthermore, post-ovulatory aging prevented cohesin subunit maintenance, or degradation, at the appropriate time. It was also suggested that destabilization of SAC signaling caused sister chromatid segregation errors in MII oocytes, and consequently increased the incidence of NCAs in early embryos. NCAs during early development are a cause for pregnancy loss, as well as being a major genetic origin of congenital deficiency [9, 20, 22]. Most NCAs originate in oocytes, and it has been widely acknowledged that maternal age is a principal risk factor for NCAs [23]. Our findings have provided distinct evidence that the post-ovulatory aging of oocytes might also become a risk factor for NCA development, irrespective of maternal age.

Objective: Osteoarthritis is one of the most common chronic conditions leading to disability among older people (age 60+ years). Knee osteoarthritis has a significant impact on daily functioning. Pain, stiffness, reduced strength, changes in posture, and reduced knee stability may result in reduced mobility. The aim of this study is to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of conservative therapeutic use of a semi-rigid knee brace for management of patients with knee osteoarthritis, using patient-reported outcomes. Design: Patients with osteoarthritis using a semirigid knee brace were asked to complete a questionnaire about the effectiveness of the brace after wearing it for 3 weeks. The primary outcome measure was mobility, assessed using an ordinal scale with and without use of the knee brace. Secondary outcome measures were pain symptoms and overall daily functioning.
Results: A total of 381 patients completed the questionnaire. The results show considerably improved mobility while using a knee brace in different mobility groups. In the group of respondents who were limited to their home environment mobility decreased by 74% while using a knee brace. In the group of respondents who were able to walk to a nearby shop mobility increased by 50%, and the group experiencing no mobility restrictions increased from 3% without using a knee brace to 13% while using a knee brace. In addition, 54% of respondents reported a reduction in pain symptoms and 62% of respondents reported an improvement in overall daily functioning while using a knee brace.
Conclusion: The results of this large-scale patientreported outcome measure (PROM) study show that the use of a semi-rigid knee brace appears to

LAY ABSTRACT
This study of patient-reported outcome measures regarding the use of stabilizing knee braces for knee osteoarthritis provides insight into the additional care and quality of life provided by the use of these orthopaedic aids. The aims of this study are to measure the effectiveness of knee braces in daily life and to validate the efficacy of using orthopeadic medical aids.In the study, 381 patients with knee Osteoarthritis were provided with knee braces and were asked about the effectiveness of the braces 3 weeks after they first started wearing them. This large-scale study found that the use of knee braces contributed to user-mobility, reduced pain, and increased the possibility to perform daily activities. Knee braces appear to serve as a suitable support for knee joints, providing pain relief and freedom of movement, and should be considered a useful non-surgical treatment method for knee Osteoarthritis.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common chronic conditions leading to disability among older people (age 60+ years) (1-5). Knee OA has a significant impact on daily functioning. Pain, stiffness, reduced strength, changes in posture, and reduced knee stability may cause reduced mobility (6).
Usually, a stepped care treatment plan is implemented, whereby more complex treatments, e.g. surgical interventions, are considered only when lesser complex treatments are found unsuitable. According to the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) in the USA and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, conservative management comprises a combination of education for self-management, exercise therapy (aerobic and strength exercise), weight management, knee braces, and pain medication. Under the Dutch national Federation of Medical Specialists (FMS) guidelines, a valgus knee brace is prescribed for patients with symptomatic medial tibiofemoral OA, where the effectiveness of other conservative management options has proven insufficient. Use of a valgus knee brace aims to delay joint replacement surgery for as long as possible, especially in relatively young and active patients (6).
Several systematic reviews have quantified the effectiveness of unloader braces in improving clinical outcomes and mechanical leverage (6-8). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a significant research gap in perception-based studies in understanding the short- and long-term consequences of these braces on the tissues in the knee joint, including the cartilage and ligaments. Current perception-based studies are based on relatively small population sizes (9-11), and further research is needed to advance our understanding of the effects of unloader braces experienced by patients with OA.
The objective of this perception-based evaluation study is to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of a semirigid knee brace in patients with knee OA.
METHODS
Measurement of perception-based outcomes among patients is used to evaluate health outcomes and quality of life and to provide insight into the value of patient care (12, 13). For this study, the patient-reported outcome measurement (PROM) toolbox of the Netherlands Healthcare Institute, and the Netherlands Federation of University Medical Centres (NFU) guidelines for the selection of Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) and PROMs were used (14-16). An illness or condition often causes complaints and symptoms, such as pain, which relate to problems with daily functioning. Retrospective measurements provide insight into the effect a treatment has on a patient's perceived health in terms of their physical well-being and/or functioning. In this study, subjects were questioned about symptoms, functional status, and perceived health. The following PROs were defined to determine the effectiveness of the knee braces:
1. How has your general daily functioning changed since using your knee brace?

2. How have your pain symptoms changed since using your knee brace?
3. Please indicate how mobile you are with/without the knee brace?
Information about health prior to and after an intervention is needed to improve the effectiveness of using a knee brace. This study compared feedback from patients about function gained with and without a semi-rigid knee brace. There are no standard or target values that could be used in the study, as there are no comparable studies regarding the effectiveness of these orthopaedic aids. The PROM questions in the study were prepared based on the usual questionnaires used in orthopaedics (surgery), thus, adhering to scientifically accepted and validated PROM questions (13, 17).
Between October 2018 and December 2020, a total of 1,003 patients with OA who were provided with a knee brace (both new users and repeat users) were invited to complete a questionnaire about the effectiveness of the brace after wearing it for 3 weeks. Patients received their knee brace from a qualified certified prosthetist/orthotist (CPO) and were mostly referred to the CPO by medical doctors. The questionnaires were sent by e-mail, and patients were informed that responding to the questionnaire was voluntary. In addition, informed consent was given. The questionnaire contained questions related to pain perception and daily functioning, each with a qualitative ordinal scale (7-point scale ranging from "very deteriorated" to "improved significantly"). Using these questions, patients were encouraged to compare their pain perception and daily functioning at the time of the survey with their perceived perception and functioning 3 weeks earlier. Mobility was expressed in meters. The primary outcome measure was mobility assessed with and without using the semirigid knee brace. Secondary outcome measures were pain symptoms and overall daily functioning assessed with the 7-point ordinal scale. Age and sex were also documented.
Descriptive statistics were used as basic measures to describe the survey data. They consist of summary descriptions of frequency and percentage response distributions, and mode was used to measure the central tendency (18).
With a population size of 4,025 patients provided with a semi-rigid knee brace in the Netherlands during the study period and a 95%, confidence level, a margin of error of 5% was calculated. This expresses the amount of random sampling error in the results of this survey.
The diagnosis of OA was confirmed by a medical doctor (MD) for all patients. The diagnosis was mostly made based on X-rays and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients throughout the Netherlands in various institutions, ranging from university hospitals and rehabilitation centres to nursing homes, were eligible for this study if the MD recommended use of a knee brace. Patients with OA were randomly allocated to treatment with a conventional semi-rigid knee brace (Agillium Reactive®, Ottobock ,Duderstadt, Germany or Defiance®, DJO, Lewisville, TX, U.S.A (Fig. 1). Both

braces were selected for their unloading capabilities, and were supplied to the patient by a qualified CPO.
RESULTS
A total of 381 out of 1,003 patients completed the outcome study questionnaire; a response rate of 38%. All responses were analysed and included in this study as acceptable data.
Table I shows the descriptive characteristics of the study population. In total, 63% of respondents were aged 60 years or over, and 30% were aged 70 years or over. This age range also matches the greatest prevalence and incidence rates of OA, where the majority of people over 55 years of age have radiological features of OA (19). The majority of respondents (60%) in this study were women.
The results are presented separately for each question in the questionnaire.
Fig. 2 shows the results regarding the change in mobility for all respondents. Mobility while using a knee brace improved considerably in different mobility groups. The mobility of respondents who were limited to their home environment reduced by 74%. The mobility of the respondents who were able to walk to a nearby shop increased by 50%, and the group experiencing mobility restrictions increased from 3% without using a knee brace to 13%

while using a knee brace. A total of 42% of respondents using a knee brace indicated that they could take a long walk again (18%) or go to the local shop (24%). 80% of mobility improvement is noted for the combined three higher mobility classes (d,e andf in Table II). Only 9% of patients were limited to their own living environment while using a knee brace.
Fig. 3 shows the results for the reduction in pain symptoms. The group wearing a knee brace showed an improvement (reduction) in pain symptoms of 54%. Of the respondents, 29% reported that their pain symptoms were reduced significantly or very significantly, while 36% experienced no change. A small difference was noted between new users and repeat users; new users showed greater improvement (61% for new users and 44% for repeat users) and less deterioration (3% for new users and 16% for repeat users).
Fig. 4 shows the results for change in overall daily functioning while using a knee brace. Sixty-two percent of respondents indicated that their general daily functioning improved after they started using a knee brace, 29% indicated that it improved significantly, and 7% very significantly. There was a small difference between the improvement in patients who started using a knee brace (new users indicate an improvement of 69%) and patients who continued the treatment with a knee brace (repeat users indicate an improvement of 60%). Nine percent of all respondents stated that their functioning deteriorated after using the knee brace.
Table II shows the mobility results for both new and repeat users with or without using a knee brace. In the low mobility class (class a - I can walk in the house (0-10 meters), a difference was reported between repeat users (39% of respondents could walk 0-10 m without using a brace, and 10% with using a brace) and new users (24% of the respondents could walk 0-10 m without using a brace, and 6% with using a brace). In addition, a difference was also noted in the highest mobility class between repeat users (class f - I no longer have a mobility restriction in terms of distance (> 5 km) - is 5% for repeat users without using a brace and 17% with using a brace) and new users (class f is 0% without using a brace and 6% with using a brace). It can be concluded that the distribution of results is skewed more towards the extreme mobility classes (low and high) for repeat users than for new users.
Table III compares a combination of mobility classes with and without a knee brace. When combining the low mobility classes, the low mobility group (class a and b combined) of users without using a knee brace is predominated by repeat users compared to new users, as 45% of respondents who are repeat users are in this lowest mobility group compared with 30% for new users. When using a knee brace, the amount of users in the low mobility group was decreased with 60% for new users and 64% for repeat users. The amount of new users in the high mobility group (class e and f combined) increased by +192% when wearing a knee

For repeat users the amount of users in the high mobility group was increased by +43%, comparing the amount of repeat users while use a knee brace (30%) with the amount of repeat users without using a knee brace (21%) in the same mobility group.
DISCUSSION
This study measured the short- and long-term effects of use of a semi-rigid knee brace in patients with knee OA, using a perception-based evaluation. The results showed that 62% of all respondents indicated an improvement in daily functioning after starting using a knee brace. In a previous study comparing a braced patient group with a control group, in which patients received only conservative management without knee bracing, the patient group

reported an improvement of 50% improvement in mobility, whereas the control group reported an improvement of 36% (20). Our study supports the findings that knee bracing improves daily functioning; we note an even higher improvement for patients using a knee brace based on a larger population (62%).

The results of this study support the findings of a 2012 PROM study by Briggs et al. (7), which showed a significant improvement in quality of life using a 12-item Short Form health
survey (SF-12) (p<0.05) and pain, stiffness, and function using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) (p<0.05) while using a brace, based on a study of 39 patients. The larger population size in the current study strengthens these findings; braces, specifically designed to unload the degenerative

This study builds on earlier perception-based studies in specifying the improved quality of life in gained mobility among mobility classes (21, 22). Whilst using a knee brace, 55% of respondents indicated that their mobility was improved; they could take a long walk again (24% of respondents),

go to the local shop (18% of respondents), or no longer experienced any mobility restrictions (13% of respondents). The use of the knee brace increased mobility by 83% in these 3 groups combined. Furthermore, a 69% reduction in patients limited to their own living environment was found when comparing the group using a knee brace (8% of respondents) with the group not using a knee brace (29% of respondents).

In the scope of this study, the authors are not aware of any previous research into the effect of knee bracing in different mobility classes.
Pain reduction
This study found that pain symptoms were reduced when using a knee brace. This finding is supported by previous studies, in which Briggs et al. reported a significant improvement in pain and function (7). They have also shown that most knee braces users (69%) found pain relief to be a very important reason to continue using the brace. This is supported by Kiel & Kaiser, showing that knee bracing resulted in a broader medial joint space when walking (23), while the medial joint space is presented as a major contributor to perceived pain symptoms.
The results of this study particularize the reduction in pain obtained with knee braces to an improvement in selfreported pain symptoms of 54% of respondents after using a knee brace. Thirty percent of the respondents reported that their pain symptoms changed significantly to very significantly. Briggs et al. have also shown that it is thought that the reduced pain experienced contributes to increased confidence in the knee and consequently improves the patient's ability to maintain their general health (7).
Course of mobility limitations over time
The mobility level of patients in the mobility range greater than 50 m was high, with, on average, 85% of respondents indicating a high level of mobility when using the knee brace. When comparing new users (88%) with repeat users (84%), no significant difference was found. These results support the findings of Van Dijk et al. and Pisters et al., who showed that limitations in activities were fairly stable during the first 3 years of follow-up (24, 25).
However, the self-reported limitation in mobility when not using a knee brace was reported to be higher for the repeat users in the current study; Only 24% of new users reported a highly limited mobility level (only being able to move within their living environment), compared with 39% of repeat users. Self-reported mobility gain for patients with a knee brace who were in the mobility range greater than 50 m was shown to improve in 26% of new users and 53% of repeat users. These results support the

findings of Holla et al. (26), showing that activity limitations decreased slightly after 2 years of follow-up.
Study limitations
Perception-based methods assess pain, function, and quality of life, which are the qualitative markers of disease progression. The quality of these methods depends on the disease condition, mood, physical activities, and ultimately the score provided by patients. Although these methods are well accepted by clinicians, it is not possible to use them to quantify morphological and biomechanical changes in the soft tissue regions. Therefore, one should be cautious about making assumptions regarding the predictive value of long- and short-term effects based on the overall physical activity of the subject.
Many patients compensate for knee instability by increasing muscle activation (co-contraction) around their knee joint. This provides a stable feeling, but also has a progressive effect on knee OA due to the increased pressure on the knee joint. Wearing a stabilizing rigid knee brace ensures a reduction in muscle co-contraction and pain (27). With a reported pain reduction of 54%, it is possible that users wearing knee braces in this study used less co-contraction, which might indicate reduced progression of knee OA. Further research is needed to confirm this finding.
The use of pain medications was not assessed in this study, and the use of analgesics could have influenced the results. Although it is expected that only a few patients use pain medication when using knee braces, further research should include this information to investigate the overall reduction in pain. In addition, 9% of patients did not experience any improvements when using a knee brace, or even experienced deterioration. While several factors, such as correct knee brace fitting, over-compensation of muscles, or additional injuries, could play a role in this, further research is required to understand these outcomes.
CONCLUSION
This large-scale PROM study of the effectiveness of use of semi-rigid knee braces in patients with knee OA shows that use of a brace contributes to general daily functioning, reduces pain, and increases the possibility

to perform daily activities. For patients with OA, reduced pain enables increased mobility away from the home environment, resulting in a more active life and increased quality of life. Use of a knee brace appears to provide suitable joint support, offering pain relief and freedom of mobility.

Abstract
Introduction: The prognosis in out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains unfavorable and depends on a number of demographic and clinical variables, the reversibility of its causes and its mechanisms. Aim: To investigate the risk factors of prehospital death in patients with OHCA in Bielsko County. Material and methods: The study analyzed all dispatch cards of the National Emergency Medical Services (EMS) teams in Bielsko-Biala for the year 2013 (n = 23 400). Only the cards related to sudden cardiac arrest in adults were ultimately included in the study (n = 272; 190 men, 82 women; median age: 71 years). Results: Sixty-seven victims (45 men, 22 women) were pronounced dead upon the arrival of the EMS team, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was not undertaken. In the remaining group of 205 subjects, CPR was commenced but was ineffective in 141 patients (97 male, 44 female). Although univariate analysis indicated 6 predictors of prehospital death, including OHCA without the presence of witnesses (odds ratio (OR) = 4.2), OHCA occurring in a public place (OR = 3.1), no bystander CPR (OR = 9.7), no bystander cardiac massage (OR = 13.1), initial diagnosis of non-shockable cardiac rhythm (OR = 7.0), and the amount of drugs used for CPR (OR = 0.4), logistic regression confirmed that only the lack of bystander cardiac massage (OR = 6.5) and non-shockable rhythm (OR = 4.6) were independent determinants of prehospital death (area under ROC curve = 0.801). Conclusions: Non-shockable rhythm of cardiac arrest and lack of bystander cardiac massage are independent determinants of prehospital death in Bielsko-Biala inhabitants suffering from OHCA. Key words: out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, prognosis, risk factors.

Determinants of unfavorable prognosis for out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest in Bielsko-Biala district

Introduction
Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is an important medical, social, and economic problem. It exerts a significant burden on the health care system and its various elements, requiring multifaceted action and financial expenditure [1]. Depending on the location in which it occurs, SCA can be classified as out-of-hospital (OHCA) or in-hospital (IHCA). These separate nosological entities are often associated with different etiology, prevalence, management, and prognosis [1].
Despite the progress made in the field of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the prognosis for OHCA remains unfavorable and depends on many demographic and clinical variables as well as on the circumstances of the SCA, its mechanisms, and its reversibility [2]. The extent of action taken to prevent post-resuscitation syndrome is also not without bearing [2].
In view of international reports, the established predictors of CPR success and variables improving SCA prognosis include male sex, a shockable cardiac rhythm, the presence of a witness, prompt CPR, short duration of CPR, restoration of consciousness, and the lack of signs of shock or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [1, 2]. However, the amount of current national data on the subject is unsatisfactory.
Aim
The study aims to identify the risk factors for prehospital death in patients after OHCA in Bielsko County.
Material and methods
Ambulance dispatch cards used by the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) teams in Bielsko-Biala in 2013 (n = 23 400) were analyzed retrospectively. The study included dispatch cards pertaining to cases of SCA (n = 276). Patients below 18 years of age were excluded from the study (n = 4). Ultimately, 272 dispatch cards were analyzed. During the analyzed period, the county featured 7 EMS substations serving the city of Bielsko-Biala and the following communes: Bestwina, Buczkowice, Czechowice-Dziedzice, Jasienica, Jaworze, Kozy, Porabka, Szczyrk, Wilamowice, and Wilkowice. The EMS stations maintain 6 specialized and 5 standard ambulances in a state of around-the-clock readiness.
The information was gathered based on standard dispatch cards issued to the EMS teams. The potential mortality risk factors included basic demographic characteristics, variables associated with the circumstances, potential cause, and mechanism (the initially diagnosed rhythm) of OHCA, actions taken by witnesses (presence of witnesses at the scene, bystander CPR, the use of an automatic external defibrillator) and by the EMS team (ambulance response time, actions taken at the scene, duration of CPR, result of CPR). The primary endpoint was prehospital death defined as death diagnosed after the EMS team's arrival without CPR or the failure of CPR performed by the EMS team after arriving at the scene.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted based on procedures available in the licensed software MedCalc (v14). Quantitative variables are presented as medians (and interquartile ranges; IQR, 25th-75th percentile). Qualitative variables are presented as absolute values and percentages. Differences in quantitative variables between the groups were examined with parametric (Student's t) or nonparametric (MannWhitney U) tests based on the type of variable distribution. The distribution was verified with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. A 2 test or Fisher's exact test was used for qualitative variables. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were used to assess the relationships between qualitative variables. In order to assess the risk of prehospital mortality, the results of basic analyses were repeated in multivariate analysis, using forward stepwise logistic regression. Variables with p < 0.1 in intergroup comparisons were included. Logistic odds ratios (logOR) and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated. The model's diagnostic accuracy was verified based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and its statistical significance. The ultimately accepted criterion of significance was p < 0.05.
Results
Out of the 272 analyzed calls, in 67 cases (45 men, 22 women), death was pronounced after the arrival of the EMS team, and CPR was not attempted. In the remaining 205 cases, CPR was conducted; it was unsuccessful in 141 individuals (97 men, 44 women).
The potential risk factors for death without CPR (i.e., in the group of 67 victims) are presented in Table I. The duration of bystander CPR (p = 0.5) (Fig. 1) and ambulance response time (p = 0.2) (Fig. 2) had no bearing on the results.
The CPR failure (in the group of 205 victims who underwent CPR) was more frequent when the OHCA occurred without the presence of witnesses (OR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.2-5.2; p = 0.01) or in a public place (OR = 2.95; 95% CI: 1.5-6,0; p = 0.003), when no bystander CPR was provided (OR = 5.0; 95% CI: 2.1-11.9; p = 0.01), no cardiac massage was attempted (OR = 5.8; 95% CI: 2.4-14.4; p < 0.001), and the initial rhythm was non-shockable (OR = 3.8; 95% CI: 2.0-7.4; p < 0.001). Individuals receiving more CPR medications had a higher chance of being resuscitated (OR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-0.7; p = 0.001). The duration of CPR conducted by a witness (p = 0.4) (Fig. 3) or the EMS team (p = 0.6) (Fig. 4) and ambulance response time (p = 0.2) (Fig. 5) had no bearing on the results. The potential risk factors for the failure of CPR attempted by the EMS team after arriving at the scene are presented in Table II.
In short, the prehospital mortality risk factors (i.e., in 272 patients) included: OHCA without witnesses (OR = 4.2; 95% CI: 2.1-8.5; p < 0.001), OHCA in a public place (OR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.6-6.0; p < 0.001), no bystander CPR (OR = 9.7; 95% CI: 4.2-22.2; p < 0.001), no bystander cardiac massage (OR = 13.1; 95% CI: 5.4-31.6; p < 0.001), and initial diagnosis of a non-shockable cardiac rhythm (OR = 7.0;

Discussion
An important step in improving the still unfavorable prognosis of OHCA is to identify its potential predictors. In our material, they were ultimately identified as: no cardiac massage by witnesses/bystanders and non-shockable rhythm of SCA. These two variables alone enabled the prediction of prehospital death in as many as 80% of cases.
These observations are in accordance with the data from the relevant Polish literature. Rudner et al. [3] demonstrated in a population of Katowice inhabitants that individuals in whom OHCA occurred in the presence of wit-

nesses had a two times higher chance of being admitted to a hospital (OR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.1-4.6) and an almost four times higher chance of being discharged from the hospital (OR = 3.9; 95% CI: 0.9-18). Furthermore, the performance of CPR by a bystander was associated with a 3-fold increase in the chance of CPR success (OR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.4-4.5) and hospital discharge (OR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1-5.3), while shockable cardiac rhythm was associated with a 4-fold increase in the chance of survival until hospital admission after OHCA (OR = 3.9; 95% CI: 1.9-7.7) and hospital discharge (OR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.2-10.3), regardless of the extent of neurological injury [3]. On the other hand, in a study conducted among the adult population of Szczecin by Jankowski [4], the success of prehospital resuscitation depended only on its duration, while the presence of witnesses and their participation in CPR had no significant effect on survival; this was explained by the small percentage of cases in which the witnesses provided aid to the SCA victims.
Our results are also in accordance with international observations reported in studies from Sweden [5], Denmark [6], Korea [7], Australia [8], Japan [9], Spain [10], Canada [11], France [12], Singapore [13], and Austria [14]. The reports cited above primarily underscored the role of early bystander CPR before the arrival of emergency teams, including bystander defibrillation [5-7, 9-11, 13, 14].
In this context, it is worthwhile to note that, in multivariate analysis, it was the lack of cardiac massage (and not necessarily other types of resuscitation) that was a predictor of prognosis, regardless of the SCA mechanism. This can be most likely attributed to the marginal number of cases in which the witnesses used automatic defibrillators (only one documented case) [15]. This confirms that patient management after OHCA requires multidisciplinary action and goes far beyond the activities of medical services alone. Each element of the aid provided to the victim is equally important, as the final outcome may depend on the

weakest link in the "chain of survival". The assessment of the circumstances of OHCA translates directly into taking proper resuscitation measures and directing further specialized lifesaving action. Therefore, improving the frequency with which aid is provided to SCA victims by witnesses is of great importance for improving the victims' survival.
Interestingly, the risk of death was observed to be increased when OHCA occurred in public places, which was in contrast with the relevant literature [6-9, 11, 12, 14]. It appears to be associated with the higher likelihood of CPR being performed by family members when the SCA occurred at home. Moreover, this relationship was not confirmed by multivariate analysis.
Another variable which was found to have statistical significance for the prognosis (though only in basic analyses) was the number of agents used during resuscitation (adrenaline alone = 1 agent, adrenaline + sodium = 2 agents, adrenaline + amiodarone = 2 agents, adrenaline + sodium + amiodarone = 3 agents, etc.). Individuals who received a higher number of agents had a higher chance of surviving until being transferred to a hospital. This issue has been discussed in the literature on several occasions [4, 12, 16, 17]. In the study by Jankowski [4], higher mortality risk was observed among patients receiving adrenaline (OR = 5.63 regardless of dosage). In a study by Dumas et al. [16] the use of adrenaline was also associated with worse prognosis (OR = 2.1 for the probability of death for a dose of 1 mg, OR = 3.3 for a dose of 2-5 mg, and OR = 4.4 for doses > 5 mg). Aschauer et al. [17] also created a prediction model for unfavorable SCA prognosis based on only 4 variables: older age, non-shockable cardiac rhythm, longer CPR duration required to restore spontaneous circulation, and larger dose of administered adrenaline. Finally, a study conducted among the inhabitants of Paris demonstrated that the necessity to use more than 3 mg of adrenaline during CPR was associated with a 20-fold increase in the mortality risk [12]. However, other authors suggest that patients

who require the administration of adrenaline during CPR have a higher chance of achieving a return of spontaneous circulation, which does not necessarily influence long-term neurological functioning (e.g., according to the CPC scale) or the risk of long-term mortality [18, 19]. Repeating adrenaline doses after the cessation of circulation impairs microcirculatory perfusion in the central nervous system and exacerbates already existing metabolic disturbances [20]. This has been reflected in the current guidelines for resuscitation: their authors advise caution when considering the administration of adrenaline [1]. The discrepancy is difficult to explain, but it can be speculated that, in this study, a return of spontaneous circulation during CPR was less likely when cardiac massage and defibrillation were used alone without the need for administrating medication. Also, it is understandable that prognosis is better when the return of hemodynamically sufficient circulation occurs quickly and the CPR is shorter (e.g., when a bystander performs early defibrillation). Formulating more rational conclusions would have been easier if the dispatch cards (the standard Polish emergency medical action cards) contained information about the time between the SCA diagnosis and the administration of adrenaline. This would, however, require systemic action consisting in changing the current forms.
The present study is not free from limitations. Firstly, result generalization is limited by the relatively short time of observation and the lack of territorial differentiation of the victims. Secondly, it is a retrospective observational study and is, therefore, prone to systematic error. Thirdly, the lack of information concerning the potential causes of the cardiac arrest precludes more precise analysis going beyond a typical epidemiological description of the event. Finally, as we have no access to information concerning the course of hospital treatment, no outcomes of patients after their transfer to the Admission Room or the Emergency Room are available.
Conclusions
Non-shockable rhythm of cardiac arrest and no cardiac massage by bystanders constitute mutually independent predictors of prehospital mortality risk in inhabitants of Bielsko County after episodes of sudden cardiac arrest.

Background: Serum-ferritin levels may be associated with psychiatric symptoms among the elderly; however, this association has not been extensively studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between serumferritin levels and mental health issues in older Koreans. Methods: This cross-sectional study included large-scale national data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2012. In total, 1,802 older Koreans (65 years old) were included. The assessed psychiatric symptoms included short sleep duration, stress, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation. Any association between serum-ferritin levels and mental health issues according to sex was examined using logistic regression analysis. Results: The prevalence of short sleep duration, stress, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation was 50.9%, 21.7%, 18.2%, and 22.5%, respectively. In men, suicidal ideation decreased with increased serum-ferritin levels after multivariate adjustment for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and comorbidities. The odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of suicidal ideation by quartiles of serum-ferritin level were 1 (reference), 1.132 (95% CI, 0.569-2.252), 0.453 (95% CI, 0.217-0.945), and 0.608 (95% CI, 0.295-1.253), respectively, (P for trend=0.039). In women, no trend was observed. However, compared to the lowest quartile, short sleep duration (<7 h) and stress perception were significantly decreased in the third quartile, with odds ratios of 0.601 (95% CI, 0.461-0.888), and 0.606 (95% CI, 0.386-0.952), respectively. Conclusion: Moderate serum-ferritin levels were associated with decreased risk for suicide ideation in men, and were associated with decreased short sleep duration and stress perception in women.

INTRODUCTION
Psychological wellbeing is a prominent component of public health, and insufficient sleep affects mental and physical health among the elderly.1) Stress can cause physical problems such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, as well as mental problems such as cognitive disorder and depression. Individuals who are often exposed to stress may become depressed and develop suicidal ideation in severe cases.2) Depressive symptoms have a high prevalence rate in Korea; according to the 2011 Korea Health statistics, 4.8% of adult men, and 10.1% of adult women experience depressive symptoms.3) Depression may be an important risk factor for suicide, and Korea has a high suicide rate among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries.4)
Iron is an essential inorganic substance for normal body physiology.5) It is an important component of hemoglobin and is involved in blood oxygen activity, brain function, cognition, and behavior. It is also essential for thyroid hormone synthesis and protein metabolism.6) Serum-ferritin is an iron-binding protein that is distributed throughout the body, and serves as a biomarker of the body's iron stores.7) Reduced serum-ferritin indicates iron deficiency, which may lead to changes in mental and cerebral mechanisms, emotion, and behavior.6,8,9) In contrast, chronic inflammation and oxidative stress may act as a link between elevated serum-ferritin levels, which may contribute to cellular or tissue damage.10) A previous study revealed that increased levels of serum-ferritin were associated with major depression in patients receiving chronic hemodialysis. This suggests that systemic, lowgrade inflammation plays a role in the onset and course of the disease.11)
Consequently, we hypothesized that serum-ferritin might be associated with mental health. However, to the best of our knowledge, few reports have demonstrated this association in large-scale human studies.12,13)
This study aimed to investigate the association between serum-ferritin levels and mental health issues (such as short sleep duration,

stress perception, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation) in the Korean elderly population, by examining large-scale, nationally representative data from the Korea Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) V (2010-2012), with an ultimate goal of clarifying the mechanisms and characteristics of mental health in the elderly.
METHODS
1. Study Population
This national, cross-sectional study was based on data from the KNHANES V survey. The KNHANES was a nationwide survey conducted by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare. The survey consisted of three sections: a health interview, a health examination, and a nutritional survey. The KNHANES V survey was conducted from January 2010 to December 2012 and utilized household records developed by the 2005 Population and Housing Census in Korea to select representative Korean national samples. Twenty households from each survey section were selected with a stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling system that considered geographic area, age, and sex. A total of 25,534 individuals participated in the KNHANES V survey (Figure 1). The present study included data for important analytic variables, such as serum-ferritin levels and the mental health questionnaire results from elderly individuals aged 65 years or older. We excluded participants diagnosed with anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] <13 g/dL for men, Hb <12 g/dL for women), stroke, myocardial infarction, angina, and cancer to eliminate other factors potentially affecting serum-ferritin levels. After these adjustments, 1,802 participants were included in the statistical analysis. The Institutional Review Board of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Korea approved the KNHANES examination and survey. All participants in the survey provided written informed consent (2010-02CON-21-C, 2011-02CON06-C, 2012-01EXP-01-2C).

metric, demographic, nutritional, and medical history data. Anthropometric variables such as height and weight were measured by trained experts according to standardized protocols. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as body weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). Waist circumference was recorded midway between the lower margin of the final rib and the upper margin of the iliac crest to the nearest 0.1 cm. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physical illness information was collected with a questionnaire. Marital status was divided into two groups, single or married, and education level was divided into two groups, college-graduate level or lower-than-college-graduate level. Monthly income was reported in the South Korean currency (won) and categorized into quartiles according to household income as follows: lowest, lower-middle, upper-middle, or highest. We divided the participants based on income into two groups: a low-income group (lowest or lower-middle), and a high-income group (upper-middle or highest), and also surveyed home ownership.
Regular exercise was divided into two groups: perform or do-notperform, based on whether the participants engaged in intense physical activity more than 3 days per week for at least 20 minutes, moderate physical activity more than 5 days per week for at least 30 minutes, or walking more than 5 days per week for at least 30 minutes. Regular exercise was classified according to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Smoking was divided into two groups based on the self-reported history of cigarette smoking, i.e., current smokers (those who were currently smoking, or had smoked more than 5 packs of cigarettes during their lifetime), and non-smokers (those who had never smoked, or had smoked less than 5 packs of cigarettes during their

lifetime). Alcohol consumption was defined as having consumed at least one alcoholic drink per month in the past year. The history of comorbidity was assessed by the answers (yes or no) to questions regarding diagnosed hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Iron intake and total energy intake were assessed with the 24-hour recall method. A trained dietitian conducted the nutrition survey in the participants' homes, and used additional tools such as food models, two-dimensional food volumes, and containers to help participants recall their nutritional intake. White blood cell (WBC) counts were measured with an automated blood analyzer XE-2100 (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan), and expressed as 10^3/uL.
3. Serum-Ferritin
Blood samples were collected after at least 8 hours of fasting. They were processed, refrigerated immediately, and transported in cold storage to the Central Testing Institute in Seoul, Korea. Serum-ferritin levels were measured by immunofluorescence-mat ferritin (DiaSorin Inc., Stillwater, MN, USA), with a gamma counter (1470 Wizard; PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland). The participants were subdivided into quartiles based on serum-ferritin levels to determine the association between ferritin levels and mental health. The men's cut off values for quartiles were 58.52 ng/mL for the lowest quartile, 93.75 ng/mL for the second quartile, 154.04 ng/mL for the third quartile, and >154.04 ng/ mL for the fourth quartile. The cut-off values for women were 38.33 ng/mL for the lowest quartile, 60.56 ng/mL for the second quartile, 93.43 ng/mL for the third quartile, and >93.43 ng/mL for the fourth quartile.

4. Mental Health
We analyzed survey data on four psychiatric symptoms. Sleep duration was divided into two groups, adequate sleep (7 hours) and inadequate sleep (<7 hours).14) Stress perception was assessed by self-reports with the following question: "How stressed do you feel during your usual life activities?" Based on the report, the participants were classified into two categories, a high-stress group and a low-stress group. Depressed mood included feeling sadness or despair continuously for >2 weeks during the past year, to a degree sufficient to interfere with daily life. The participants were divided into two groups, depression and non-depression. We also asked participants if they had experienced suicidal ideation during the past year.
5. Statistical Analysis
We obtained data by complex sampling and considered strata, clusters, and weights. All analyses were performed with the sample weights from the KNHANES V survey. The clinical characteristics of men and women were compared using the Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables, and a generalized linear model for continuous variables. Data for continuous variables are expressed as mean±stan­ dard error, and data for categorical variables are expressed as mean± standard error (%, unweighted number). We performed multiple logistic regression analyses to calculate the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, for the association between serum-ferritin levels and mental health. Age, BMI, waist circumference, education level, income level, housing status, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol con-

sumption, history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension, energy intake, iron intake, and WBC counts were adjusted. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS for Windows ver. 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A P for trend <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
1. General Characteristics of the Participants
Table 1 shows the general characteristics of the participants. The study included 769 men and 1,032 women. The mean serum-ferritin level in men was significantly higher than that in women (122.43±5.71 versus 74.24±2.45 ng/mL, respectively; P<0.001). Overall, women were older, and had a higher BMI than men. Women had a lower education level and housing status, and were less likely to be smokers or consume alcohol than men. Psychiatric symptoms showed a higher rate in women (short sleep duration [<7 hours]: 42.9%±2.3% versus 56.6%±1.8%; stress perception: 11.6%±1.4% versus 28.9%±1.9%; depressed mood: 11.4%±1.4% versus 23.2%±1.7%; and suicidal ideation: 15.7%±1.8% versus 27.4%±1.8%).
2. General Characteristics of the Participants according to the Quartiles of Serum-Ferritin Levels
The characteristics of the study participants according to the serumferritin quartiles of men and women are shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. Men with low serum-ferritin levels had low household incomes (P=0.011). There were also significant differences in alcohol

3. Association between Serum-Ferritin Levels and Mental Health
Tables 4 and 5 present the ORs (95% confidence intervals) of mental health in men and women, respectively, according to the serum-ferritin quartiles. Model 1 was adjusted for age, BMI, and waist circumference. Model 2 was adjusted for age, BMI, waist circumference, education level, income level, housing status, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension, energy intake, iron intake, and WBC counts. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, serum-ferritin level was significantly associated with suicidal ideation in the fully adjusted model in men (Q1:1 [reference], Q2:1.132 [95%CI, 0.569-2.252], Q3:0453 [95%CI, 0.217-0.945], Q4:0.608 [95%CI, 0.295-1.253]; P for trend=0.039). In women, no trend was observed; however, compared to the lowest quartile, short sleep duration (<7 hours) and stress perception were significantly decreased in the third quartile, and the odds ratios were 0.601 (95% CI, 0.406-0.888) and 0.606 (95% CI, 0.386-0.952), respectively.
DISCUSSION
This study examined the association between serum-ferritin levels

and mental health in a nationally representative sample of older Koreans. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported study to explore the link between serum-ferritin and mental health.
We found that men with lower serum-ferritin levels exhibited a trend for higher risk of suicidal ideation, and compared to the lowest quartile, suicidal ideation was significantly decreased in the third quartile. High-impulsivity has been linked with low-iron status in some observational and experimental studies. Moscicki15) reported that low-iron status may be associated with suicide via the pathway of increased impulsivity. A sufficient amount of iron is particularly important for the synthesis of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in mood disorders and impulsivity.13,16) Studies on the serotonergic system have found that serotonin was reduced in the ventral prefrontal cortex region, resulting in impaired inhibition and a greater propensity to act on powerful feelings such as suicidal or aggressive feelings.13) However, in the present study, depressed mood, a considerable cause for suicide, was not associated with ferritin level. This result may be related to the characteristics of elderly depression. In the elderly, depressed mood may be less prominent than other symptoms, such as loss of interest and appetite, sleeplessness, and anergia.17)
Our study also found that moderately elevated serum-ferritin (Q3) levels were associated with a decreased risk of short sleep duration in women. This association was also independent of several confounders. The relationship between sleep duration and serum-ferritin is widely known, and low ferritin level has been associated with restless

leg syndrome (which disturbs sleep), and in a previous randomized blind study of restless leg syndrome subjects, the symptoms were relieved after oral iron supplementation.18) However, although an association with ferritin and dopamine was shown, the ultimate mechanism for restless leg syndrome was not elucidated.
Stress perception was also decreased in older women with moder-

ately elevated serum-ferritin levels. Several previous studies have explored the relationship between serum- ferritin and mental health, (mainly depression), with conflicting results.19,20) However, few studies have investigated the effect of iron status on stress, and the precise mechanism by which lower serum-ferritin levels might cause stress remains unclear.12) A possible role of iron in brain function and emo-

tional behavior is suggested by the association of mental health with decreased serum-ferritin levels.9,21,22) Poor iron status, particularly advanced iron deficiency, alters myelination, and neurotransmitter metabolism and function in brain regions such as the hippocampus, striatum, and cortex.23) In particular, a sufficient amount of iron is needed for the synthesis of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in mood disorders.24)
Additionally, the observed relationship between decreased serumferritin concentration and mental health differed in men and women in this study. The inconsistencies may simply be due to the differences in total serum-ferritin levels in men and women, since lower serumferritin concentrations were more common in women. Ikeda et al.25) found that estrogen regulates hepcidin, a liver-derived iron regulatory protein, which plays a crucial role in iron metabolism. A recent animal study showed that the serotonin transporter decreased in the frontal cortex, but increased in the nucleus accumbens in females, if an iron deficiency was present. In males, an increase in the serotonin and dopamine transporters was observed in the nucleus accumbens with iron deficiency.26)
However, the association of mental health and ferritin in males and females was observed in the moderate, but not high ferritin level subjects in our study. Serum-ferritin is an iron storage protein but also an inflammatory marker that may be released from damaged cells, and could be a marker of cellular damage.27) Therefore, increased ferritin may be caused by inflammation (and not iron overload) in subjects with a high ferritin level. Consequently, the mental health and ferritin association may be complex. For example, in another study, high ferritin levels were associated with liver or renal disease, and malignancy.28) In addition, in our study, daily iron intake was not significantly different in each group; hence, the cause for the high ferritin levels was unclear.
The principal strengths of our study were the large-scale, nationally representative sample of older Koreans, and the investigation of the association between serum-ferritin levels and mental health after stratification by sex. We also adjusted for potentially confounding factors that could influence the results. Mental health is associated with many socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics. In addition, serumferritin levels are related to patient disease history, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Also, inflammatory markers, such as WBC counts, may be additional confounding factors.29)
However, this study had some limitations. First, this was a cross-sectional study, and thus we could not identify a direct causative relationship between serum-ferritin levels and mental health. Hence, further prospective studies should be conducted to establish a causal relationship between serum-ferritin levels and mental health. Second, mental health was evaluated by self-reported questionnaires, and such research instruments may not constitute a sufficient assessment. Third, cognitive function was not included in our report because of lack of data. Cognitive function is an important reflection of mental health in the elderly; therefore, further study is needed.
In conclusion, low serum-ferritin levels were associated with an in-

creased suicidal ideation in Korean elderly men, and increased risk of short sleep duration and stress perception in Korean elderly women.

Purpose: To present a case of peripheral infiltrative keratitis mimicking infectious keratitis on the flap margin and limbus, which appeared on the first postoperative day after the laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). Methods: A 36-year-old woman who underwent uneventful bilateral simultaneous LASIK developed multiple round infiltrate along the flap margin reaching to limbus from the 11 o'clock to 6 o'clock area in both eyes. Results: The flap was lifted and irrigation was performed with antibiotics. but infiltration seemed to appear again. The infiltrate was more concentrated at the periphery and was extended to the limbus. Direct smear and culture for bacteria and fungus were negative. Topical prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops was added, infiltrative condition was resolved. Conclusions: LASIK induced peripheral infiltrative keratitis, in which infectious origin was ruled out, is reported Korean Journal of Ophthalmology 21(3):172-174, 2007
Key Words: DLK, LASIK, topical corticosteroid

Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) has been shown to be an effective treatment for myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. As with any surgical procedure, complications can arise that threaten best spectacle-corrected visual acuity. When a diffuse infiltrate enclosed in the interface appears within 2 to 6 days postoperatively without anterior chamber reaction or epithelial defect, it can be diagnosed as diffuse lamellar keratitis (DLK). It emanates intermittently or in clumps throughout a broad area.1
Possible etiologies are included oil, wax, metallic fragments, silicates, bacterial endotoxins, epithelial defects, and laser / contaminant interaction, a contaminant in the lamellar interface introduced at the time of surgery. It showed response to topical steroids. Treatment, however, largely rests on the different stages of DLK.1-3
This is a report of multiple round peripheral infiltrate developed following the flap margin and limbus mimicking infectious keratitis on the first day after LASIK.

Case Report
A 36 year old woman went through routine bilateral simultaneous LASIK on March 23, 2006, for a refractive error of -4.00 D sphere -1.00 D cylinder axis 180 in both eyes with the NAVEX SYSTEM (Nidek Advanced Visual Excimer, NIDEK, USA) in local eye clinic. The whole operation progressed unremarkably without signs of bleeding from the flap edge before or after the surgery.
0.5% Moxifloxacin eye drops and 0.1% fluorometholone eye drops were prescribed 4 times a day. The day after the operation, the patient complained watering, severe photophobia, bilateral redness and whitish changes in the cornea.
As the infiltration grew worse, she was transferred to our hospital's department of ophthalmology. Visual acuity came out 20/25 in both eyes with correction.
Both Intraocular pressure is 11 mmHg by non-contact tonometry. Through a slit-lamp examination, both lids appeared normal without any indications of meibomitis or blepharitis. Mild congestion was found in the conjunctiva. Numerous round infiltrate could be seen along the flap margin (Fig. 1), diffused from the 11 o'clock to 6 o'clock direction.
The infiltrate was more concentrated at the periphery and faded out centrally while the center of the flap was left unaffected. There were no distinguishable epithelial defects. Also, the anterior chamber showed neither cells nor flare.

Because the shape of the infiltration was diffusely round, we could not rule out the infection.
During flap lifting and antibiotics irrigation, bacterial and fungal culture were obtained. 0.5% moxifloxacin eye drops and fortified vancomycin 50 mg/ml eye drops were given in each eye for 4 times a day. The infiltration seemed to improve, but on the 2nd day after operation, the infiltrate had developed to involve the flap edge from the 2 o'clock to 11 o'clock direction and also involved the limbus in both eyes. Direct smear and culture for bacteria and fungus were negative. Blood tests were performed for human immunodeficiency disease, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antigen, rheumatoid factor, and C-reactive protein, but they all turned out negative also. But the infiltrate did not advance centrally, alone with topical antibiotics, its margin appearing clear (Fig. 2). We started administrating 1% topical prednisolone acetate eye drops every 3 hours.
On the 6th day after operation, the symptoms showed improvement. The infiltrate in the peripheral area decreased significantly, with the fogginess in the interface also diminished remarkably (Fig. 3). Refraction was -0.25 -2.00 ×10 in the right eye and -1.25 -1.75×150 in the left eye, the visual acuity improved to 20/20. The IOP in both eyes

was 10 mmHg.
D iscussion
Corneal infiltrations after LASIK are relatively uncommon complications. Because corneal infiltrates represent a nonspecific accumulation of inflammatory cells, several possible causes should be considered. Probably the most important complication is infectious keratitis. An infection after LASIK can be rapidly progressive and potentially vision threatening. If an infection has been ruled out, other etiologies can be entertained.
Generally, peripheral corneal infiltrates can be associated with several etiologies, including blepharitis-related, staphylococcus hypersensitivity infiltrates, Terrien's marginal degeneration, Mooren's ulcer, and peripheral ulcerative keratitis associated with autoimmune or collagen vascular disease.4,5
Singhal et al.6 reported one case in likeliness with our case. Young man developed a thick band of infiltrate between the flap margin and limbus extending from 2 o'clock to 9 o'clock in both eyes. The infiltrate was more concentrated at the periphery and faded centrally and progressed diffusely

into the interface leading to typical diffuse lamellar keratitis. The infiltrate responded to topical prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops
Ambrosio et al.7 Lahner et al.5 also reported respectively 2 cases of sterile peripheral infiltration after LASIK which showed good response to topical steroid therapy.
The patient concerned in the present case showed no clinical or serologic signs of connective tissue disorder. There was no evidence of meibomitis or blepharitis, and there was no history of Staphylococcal marginal keratitis as well. Although the surgery was routine, she displayed acute symptoms one day after the operation. The infiltrate appeared in multiple round shapes following the flap margin without any epithelial defects. These findings could not rule out the possibility of infectious keratitis. The patient had been using 0.5% moxifloxacin eye drops before she was asked for our consult. The patient did not seem to respond to the antibiotic so we immediately performed flap lifting and antibiotics irrigation but infiltration soon appeared again and progressed to the limbus outside of flap. We added topical steroids into the treatment starting from the second day after the operation and the patient showed a response.
Several points suggest sterile infiltrate: the absence of conjunctival injection or ciliary flush, the absence of epithelial defects or surrounding edema, the absence of anterior chamber reaction, and the response to steroids. The infiltrate showed response to intensive topical corticosteroid therapy, which cleared completely except for a mild but negligible regression in the both eyes in the last follow-up.
As in the case of the other study, we also achieved good results in our case with topical steroid therapy.
From the fact that the symptoms improved after additional steroid therapy, immune reaction or inflammatory reaction seems to be the most acceptable cause, but infection could not be ruled out completely because wide-range antibiotics were continuously being used.
Although the exact mechanism of this complication remains unclear, recognition of this entity and its

differentiation from infectious keratitis is essential to the management of these patients. Appropriate and early management usually results in a rapid disappearance of the infiltrates without affecting the final outcome. Nevertheless, it is important to maintain a high degree of suspicion for infectious keratitis because the management is very different and the potential outcome much worse if the keratitis is due to an infectious etiology. One could perform a culture and treat these cases empirically as infectious for the first 24 to 36 hours. If the cultures come back negative, one could start topical and systemic steroids.8
In conclusion, to look out the confusion between infectious keratitis and sterile keratitis, this case can be addressed as LASIK-induced bilateral peripheral infiltrative keratitis.

abstract
Baricitinib is a recently approved anti-rheumatic drug having very poor aqueous solubility and hence its performance suffers from low or inconsistent oral bioavailability. The purpose of the study was to develop and evaluate poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles of baricitinib in order to enhance in vitro dissolution and performance. Nano-suspension of baricitinib with or without PLGA, a biodegradable, FDA approved semi-synthetic polymer, was developed by nanoprecipitation method. Research methodology employed a quantitative research utilizing experimental design wherein effect of independent variables such as amount of polymer, drug: polymer ratio, types of solvent, and solvent: anti-solvent ratio were evaluated over the size and size distribution of nanoparticles along with entrapment efficiencies. Among the several organic phases evaluated, acetone was found to be suitable solvent for drug and polymer. The aqueous phase (anti-solvent) was deionized water containing 1% w/v pluronic 127 as the stabilizer of nanoparticle suspension. The optimized nanoparticles had particle size less than 100 nm (91 nm ± 6.23) with a very narrow size distribution (0.169 ± 0.003), high zeta potential (À12.5 mV ± 5.46) and entrapment efficiency (88.0%). The optimized nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy and in vitro dissolution studies. In-vitro dissolution study of PLGA nanoparticles exhibited sustained release with approximately 93% release of baricitinib during 24-h period. Ó 2019 The Authors.

1. Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation of joints such as knees, ankles, hands and feet which leads to swelling, pain and immobility (Aletaha et al., 2010). Treatment options available to treat this disease include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), corticosteroids, diseasemodifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) and injectable biologics. Baricitinib, a new sub-class of DMARD, has recently been approved as oral immediate release tablets by USFDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis especially for the patients not responding to the available therapies (Drug Approval Package: Olumiant baricitinib, 2018). It is a selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 and

2 (JAK 1 and JAK 2). Janus kinases are group of enzymes that activate signal transducers and activators of transcription enabling the inflammation and immune function (Assessment report Olumiant, 2018). Baricitinib is an aromatic polyheterocyclic compound (Fig. 1a) with molecular formula and molecular weight as C16H17N7O2S and 371.42 respectively (Assessment report Olumiant, 2018). As per assessment report, baricitinib belongs to class III of biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS), which means that it is highly soluble and poorly permeable drug, however, the same report also mentioned that baricitinib is practically insoluble. (Assessment report Olumiant, 2018). Nevertheless, it has been reported to have both solubility (0.357 mg/ml of water) as well as permeability (Log P = 1.08) challenges as per drugbank identification report (Drugbank: identification of baricitinib, 2018). Baricitinib has been reported to be soluble in organic solvents such as dimethyl sulphoxide (74 mg/ml), dimethyl formamide (50 mg/ ml) but very poorly soluble in water and ethanol (<1 mg/ml at 25 °C) (Baricitinib: technical information, 2018). Another product information on baricitinib reported poor aqueous solubility of baricitinib ($0.5 mg/ml in 1:1 mixture of phosphate buffer saline pH 7.2: dimethyl formamide) while solubility in organic solvents like such as dimethyl sulphoxide and dimethyl formamide was

The research methodology employed a quantitative research utilizing experimental design wherein effect of the dependent variables such as nanoparticle size, size distribution (polydispersity index-PDI), zeta potential and entrapment efficiency over the independent variables such as amount of polymer, drug, type of solvent, and solvent: anti-solvent ratio were investigated.

$50 mg/ml (Product information: baricitinib, 2018). Drugs with poor solubility or permeability suffer with low and or inconsistent bioavailability affecting the performance and therapeutic goals (Dahan and Miller, 2012). Moreover, low bioavailability necessitates administration of higher doses that may lead to side effects. Oral bioavailability of aqueous solution of baricitinib in 0.5% methylcellulose was reported as 48% in dogs, 54% in rats, 47-68% in monkey and 79% in human (Assessment report Olumiant, 2018). Pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-1, total clearance and elimination half-life after oral administration of baricitinib in healthy volunteer were reported as $112 nM, $1h, 740 nM Â h, $17 L/h and $8 h respectively (Assessment report Olumiant, 2018). The inter-subject variability of pharmacokinetic parameters was reported to be moderate with a range between 17 and 26% in healthy volunteers while in patients with rheumatoid arthritis it was as high as 41% (Assessment report Olumiant, 2018).
There are various techniques to improve solubility and bioavailability of such drugs. Polymeric nanoparticles based on PLGA (Fig. 1b) have been investigated extensively for the enhancement of solubility or bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs due to certain advantages such as biodegradable and biocompatible nature of the copolymer. Moreover, it is non-immunogenic, nontoxic, and approved by FDA for various biomedical and pharmaceutical applications (Makadia and Siegel, 2011). The recent literature search revealed that PLGA is one of the most widely used polymeric materials employed for the fabrication of nanoparticles. It has been reported to enhance solubility and bioavailability of several poorly soluble drugs such as resveratrol (Singh and Pai, 2014), nelfinavir (Venkatesh et al., 2015), lopinavir (Joshi et al., 2016), docetaxel (Rafiei, and Haddadi, 2017) and benzophenone (Costabile et al., 2018).
This study has been undertaken to develop and evaluate baricitinib encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles to improve dissolution and performance of the drug. There is no report on the investigation of solubility or bioavailability of baricitinib encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Baricitinib was purchased from Mesochem Technology Co Ltd (Beijing, China). PLGA polymer (50:50), Pluronic acid 127 and

Baricitinib encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles were prepared by nanoprecipitation method which involves precipitation of insoluble drugs in the aqueous phase when an organic solution of drug and polymer mixture is added slowly to the aqueous phase kept on moderate stirring (Fessi et al., 1989). Definite amount of baricitinib and PLGA were dissolved in suitable organic solvent which was then added dropwise in anti-solvent kept over moderate stirring of 700 rpm. The mixture was stirred over night to remove the organic solvent that rendered hardening of nanoparticles. Nanosuspension was centrifuged at 15000 Â rcf (Centurion scientific, UK) for 30 min to separate the nanoparticles, which was then washed with cold water and freeze- dried (Mill rock technology, Kingston, NY) for further analyses.
2.3.1. Effect of solvent Various organic solvents like acetone (AC), acetonitrile (AN),
dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EA) and tetrahydrofuran (THF), were investigated to optimize the organic phase for nanoprecipitation. Accurately weighed PLGA (50 mg) and baricitinib (10 mg) was dissolved separately in 10 ml of each organic solvent to prepare different formulation with formulation codes (F1-F5) as presented in Table 1. The prepared organic phases were added dropwise to the 50 ml of anti-solvent (1% aqueous pluronic 127) kept over magnetic stirrer rotating at 700 RPM.
2.3.2. Effect of anti-solvent To investigate the effect of anti-solvent on nanoprecipitation,
different ratio of solvent: anti-solvent (1:2, 1:3, 1:5 and 1:10) were investigated for optimization of the nanoparticles. Accurately weighed baricitinib (10 mg) and PLGA (50 mg) were dissolved in 10 ml of acetone as a solvent for both drug and polymer. The deionized water was used as anti-solvent containing 1% pluronic 127 as stabilizer. The composition of the formulations (F6-F9) are presented in Table 2.

The organic phase containing 10 mg of baricitinib and different amount of PLGA in the range of 1-10 mg/ml were prepared in 10 ml of acetone to have different formulations (F10-F13) as presented in Table 3. The prepared organic phases were then added dropwise to the 50 ml of antisolvent (1% aqueous pluronic 127) kept over magnetic stirrer rotating at 700 RPM.
2.3.4. Effect of drug The effect of drug on the particle size, size distribution and zeta
potential were investigated by preparing formulations with or without drug and or polymer. The composition of the formulations (F14-F16) are presented in Table 4. The component (s) were dissolved in 10 ml of acetone to prepare organic phases (except F16, which was prepared by suspending 10 mg of baricitinib in 1% pluronic 127 for comparison purpose).

In this study, we employed state of the art equipment, Zetasizer Nano ZS, model ZEN3500 (Malvern Instruments, UK), for particle size and size distribution measurement. It utilizes a patented non-invasive back scatter (NIBS) technology that measures the scattered light at a backscatter angle of 173° improving it's sensitivity and measuring capacity. The nanoparticles ($5 mg) were suspended in 10 ml of deionized water by vortex mixing for 30 s followed by ultrasonication for 60 s to break agglomerates if any. Appropriate volume, approximately 2 ml of the prepared nanoparticle suspension was taken in the disposable plastic cuvette. Particle size was then measured in triplicate at 25 °C. The size of nanopartilces is reported as Zaverage diameter (Eq. (3)), an intensity based harmonic mean diameter calculated by cumulant analysis using least squares fitting, therefore considered as relatively insensitive to experimental noise (Finsy and De Jaeger, 1991).

2.4. Optimization of nanoparticles
The prepared nanoparticle formulations were optimized on the basis of visual appearance (agglomeration), particle size, size distribution (polydispersity index), zeta potential and % entrapment efficiency.
2.4.1. Particle size and size distribution The particle size and size distribution was investigated by
dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique, wherein fluctualtions in the intensity of scattered light is measured as a function of movement (diffusion) of nanoparticles. The smaller the nanoparticles, the faster will be the diffusion (Brownian motion), as described by Eq. (1), derived from Stoke-Einstein diffusion equation (Eq. (2)). Faster diffusion of the nanoparticles result in rapid fluctualtions in the scattered light. These fluctuations in the scattered light is then measured by a photon counter and correlated with the diffusion coefficient of nanoparticle (hydrodynamic

2.4.2. Evaluation of zeta potential of nanoparticle suspension The zeta potential of disperse systems such as nanoemulsions
and nanosuspensions is one of the very important characteristics that helps in stability of the dispersions. It is potential difference across the phase boundaries between dispersed phase and dispersion medium. It is considered as an index of repulsion, thus higher the zeta potential, higher will be repulsion between the dispersed particles with similar charges resulting in more stable dispersions. The magnitude of zeta potential mainly depends on the charges over the dispersed phase and in the dispersion medium, which in turn is influenced by dielectric constant/ionic strength, conductivity, viscosity and pH of the dispersion medium as described by Henry equation (Eq. (4)). Therefore, evaluation of the zeta potential of nanoparticle suspension becomes very important to predict its fate such as stability, transportation or absorption within the body/body tissues. Zeta potential of nanoparticles is determined experimentally by measuring the electrophoretic mobility of the nanoparticles i.e. measurement of velocity of nanoparticles moving towards electrodes under electrical fields. The higher the velocity, the higher will be the magnitude of zeta potential. In this study, we used zetasizer nano ZS (Malvern Instrument, UK) with patented mixed mode measurement, phase analysis light scattering (M3PALS), which is capable of measuring mean zeta potential and zeta potential distribution with excellent accuracy. Briefly, the nanoparticles ($5 mg) were suspended in 10 ml of 10 mM sodium chloride by vortex mixing (30 s) followed by ultrasonication for

60 s to break agglomerates if any. The appropriate volume ($0.9 ml of nanosuspension) was then introduced with the help of syringe into specialized polycarbonate zeta cells (folded capillary cell with gold-plated electrodes, model DTS1017, Malvern Instruments) held in inverted position to avoid introduction of air bubbles. Caps for zeta cells were used to close the cell. Zeta potential was then measured in triplicate at 25 °C.

2.4.3. Drug entrapment efficiency of nanoparticles The drug entrapment efficiency of the nanoparticle formulations
was calculated by indirect method which involded sedimentation of nanoparticles by ultracentrifugation followed by analysis of unentrapped drug in the supernetant. The difference between the amount of drug added initially in the formulation and unentrapped drug found in the supernetant gives the amount of drug entrapped in formulation. Briefly, nanoparticle suspensions were centrifuged at 15000 Â rcf for 30 min. The supernetant obtained was analyzed by bouble beam UV spectrophotometer (UV 630, Jasco, Japan) at 224 nm after appropriate dilution. The % entrapment efficiency of the formulation was calculated as mentioned in Eq. (5).

2.5. Characterization of baricitinib encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles
The characterization of optimized nanoparticle was carried out by studying the size and surface morphology by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), powder properties by X-ray Diffractrometry (XRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Fourier Transform Infra Red spectroscopy (FT-IR), in vitro drug release studies and release mechanism.
2.5.1. Size and surface characterization The size and surface of baricitinib encapsulated nanoparticles
were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (Zeiss EVO LS10; Cambridge, UK). The dried nanopartilces were suspended in one ml of deionized water and sonicated for 1 min to break the agglomeration if any. A drop of nanoparticle suspension was fixed on the carbon tape (SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA) and gold coated under vacuum (Q150R sputter coater, Quorum Technologies Ltd, East Sussex, UK) in an argon atmosphere at 20 mA for 60 s (Alshehri et al., 2017).
2.5.2. X-ray diffractometry (X-RD) of nanoparticles The X-ray diffractometry of the pure baricitinib and baricitinib
encapsulated PLGA nanopartilces was conducted to compare

powder characteristics before and after nanoencapsulation using Altima IV, X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan). The appropriate amount of dried nanopartilces and pure drug samples were placed on the XRD sample holder and pressed with help of glass slide. The X ray diffraction patterns at 2h were then obtained by scanning the samples between 5° and 60° at a step size and step time of 0.02° and 0.5 s respectively (Ansari, 2016).
2.5.3. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) The differential scanning calorimetry of the drug and drug
encapsulated nanoparticles was carried out by using DSC-N 650 (SCINCO, Italy). Approximately 5 mg of pure drug sample and drug encapsulated nanoparticles were crimped into aluminum pans. Empty aluminum pan was crimped similarly to be used as reference material. The sample and the reference were then p laced in sample holder and scanned between 50 and 250 °C at a rate of 10 °C per minute with nitrogen gas flowing at 20 ml per minute.
2.5.4. Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR) Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy of the drug and drug
enclosed nanoparticles was conducted by using the potassium bromide (KBr) disc technique on the FT-IR instrument (FT/IR-4600, Jasco, Japan). Approximately 5 mg of drug or drug encapsulated nanoparticles was mixed and triturated with equal amount of KBr in mortar. The obtained mixtures were then compressed by Quick Press KBr pellet kit to obtain thin films. The sample film is mounted in sample holder and scanned between a wavenumber range of 400-4000 cmÀ1 after taking background scan.
2.5.5. In vitro release study In vitro release study of nanoparticles was performed by sample
and separate method (Shen and Burgess 2013). The nanoparticle sample containing $10 mg drug was weighed and introduced into 25 ml of release media (phosphate buffer pH 6.8, containing 0.5% w/v of Sodium lauryl sulphate) kept on thermostated (37 ± 1 °C) biological shaker rotating at 100 RPM (LBS-030S-Lab Tech, Korea). An aliquot of 1 ml was sampled at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after the addition of nanoparticles in release media. Fresh media was introduced after every sampling to maintain the sink condition. Withdrawn samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rcf for 30 min then analyzed by double beam UV spectrophotometrically at 224 nm. The release kinetics (mechanism of drug release) of nanoparticles were studied by fitting the release data to zero order, first order, Higuchi and Korsmeyer-Peppas plots (Mu and Feng, 2003). The release rate constants k and n of the models were calculated by linear regression analysis.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Formulation of baricitinib encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles
Fabrication of baricitinib encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles were achieved by nanoprecipitation method (Fessi et al., 1989). It is one of the simplest methods of fabrication of nanopartilces based on bottom up technology. It involved solubilization of baricitinb and PLGA in a suitable organic solvent followed by slow addition of the prepared organic phase into aqueous phase resulting in nanoprecipitation. We prepared several formulations and investigated the effect of various independent variables such as amount of PLGA, baricitinib: PLGA ratio, nature of organic solvent, and solvent: anti-solvent ratio on the fabrication of nanoparticles.

3.2. Optimization of baricitinib encapsulated nanoparticles
The development and optimization of nanoparticles were performed by investigating the effect of several independent variables such as amount of polymer, amount of drug, types of solvent and anti-solvent with varying ratio over the dependent variable such as size, size distribution, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency of nanoparticle suspension.
3.2.1. Effect of solvent Several solvents were investigated to select the optimum sol-
vent for nanoprecipitation based on absence of agglomeration and parameters such as nanoparticle size, size distribution, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency. Formulation 1 (F1) containing acetone was optimized and selected as solvent for polymer and drug based on absence of agglomeration, the lowest size (120 nm), smallest PDI (0.091), the highest zeta potential (À8.5 mv) and good entrapment efficiency (Fig. 2). The entrapment efficiency of formulation in acetonitrile (F-2) and dichloromethane (F3) were higher with 93.2% and 91.9% respectively. However, these formulations were not chosen as optimum owing to larger nanoparticle size (PDI) of 964 nm (0.804) and 608 nm (0.643) for F-2 and F-3 respectively. The effect of solvent on the size, size distribution and entrapment efficiency of nanoparticles is not well understood. Smaller sizes of nanoparticles in formulation F-1 may be ascribed to better solubility of PLGA in acetone and better diffusion of acetone in the anti-solvent compared to other solvents. Moreover, low boiling point, high dielectric constant and high water miscibility of acetone may be advantageous in producing smaller size nanoparticles (Huang and Zhang 2018).
3.2.2. Effect of anti-solvent Various ratio of solvent: anti-solvent (1:2, 1:3, 1:5 and 1:10)
were tested for optimization of the nanoparticles based on size, PDI, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency. Decrease in the solvent:antisolvent ratio from 1:2 to 1:5 resulted in reduction of particle size and PDI but at the cost of loss in the entrapment efficiency. Further decrease in the phase ratio resulted in larger nanoparticles with higher entrapment efficiency. A solvent: antisolvent ratio of 1:5 (formulation number F-8) was chosen as the optimum formulation based on the smallest size (91 nm), the

lowest PDI (0.169), the highest zeta potential value (À12.5) with entrapment efficiency of 88.0% (Fig. 3). The smaller sizes of nanoparticles at smaller solvent:antisolvent ratio could be attributed to low viscosity of the mixture and better diffusion of solvent in the antisolvent (Sahu and Das, 2014).
3.2.3. Effect of concentration of PLGA on nanoparticles Organic solutions of PLGA with various concentration were
investigated for optimization of the nanoparticles based on size, PDI, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency. Increasing concentration of polymer in organic solution resulted in increase in size and entrapment efficiency of the nanoparticles (Fig. 4). Formulation F-10 that contains the lowest concentration of PLGA (1 mg/ ml of in acetone) resulted in the smallest nanoparticles (88 nm) but with the lowest entrapment efficiency (69.1%). Formulation F 14, with highest concentration of PLGA (10 mg/ml in acetone) exhibited the highest drug entrapment efficiency (90.8%) but at the cost of comparatively larger nanoparticles (158 nm). This increase in the size of nanoparticles, upon the increment of PLGA concentration in the acetone, may be due to the increased viscosity that might have reduced the diffusion of PLGA form acetone to the anti-solvent (Ansari, 2017).
3.2.4. Effect of drug and polymer on the nanoparticles The effect of drug on the particle size, size distribution and zeta
potential was investigated by preparing formulations with or without drug and or polymer (Fig. 5). The nanoparticles of drug alone (formulation F-14) prepared by nanoprecipitation of organic solution of baricitinib resulted in large nanoparticles (427 nm) with high PDI (0.46) and low zeta potential (À8.6 mV). Similarly, nanoparticles of polymer alone (formulation F-15) prepared by nanoprecipitation of organic solution of PLGA resulted in larger nanoparticles (635 nm) with higher PDI (0.86) and lower zeta potential (À5.5 mV). The larger size of nanoparticles with very high PDI and very low zeta potential are indicative of particle growth or aggregation which could be due to absence of polymer. Polymeric materials present in organic phase (formulation F1-F13) prevent aggregation of nanosuspension by forming a layer around the nanoprecipitates once it is formed thus control and stabilize the size of particles. The mechanism of stabilization of size of nanoparticles could include either steric stabilization or electrostatic

repulsion due to presence of surface charges or a combination of both. The drug suspension (F16) exhibited even poorer particle characteristics with average particle size of 935 nm, the highest PDI (0.96) and the lowest zeta potential value (À1.1 mV).
Based on the combined effect of types of solvent, solvent: antisolvent ratio (phase ratio) and PLGA concentration (drug: polymer ratio) over the desired properties of nanoparticles such as the lowest size, the lowest PDI, the highest zeta potential and high entrapment efficiency, formulation F-8 was selected as optimized formulation for further evaluations. The smaller nanoparticles are known to be absorbed or up taken by mucosal cells better than their larger counterparts (Win and Feng, 2005). The particle size, PDI and zeta potential of nanoparticles were evaluated by zeta sizer nano ZS (Malvern, UK). An image of size analysis and zeta potential analysis of F-8 is presented in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 respectively.
The characterization of nanoparticle suspension in term of zeta potential is one of most important tool for prediction of stability of dispersions. It is considered as an index of repulsion, thus the more is the value of zeta potential, the more will be stability of nanosuspension. A higher zeta potential means higher electric charge

on the surface of the NPs that prevents aggregation of the nanoparticles. In the present investigation, we found an average zetapotential of around À10.5 mV for all the prepared formulation with the value of À12.5 ± 5.6 mV for the optimized one (F-8). It has been reported that absolute Zeta potential values above 30 mV provide good stability (Jiang et al., 2009). However, large molecular weight solids or polymers are known to stabilize the suspensions by steric hindrance despite of low zeta potential (Honary and Zahir, 2013).
3.3. Characterization of nanoparticles
The characterization of optimized nanoparticle formulation (F8) was carried out by studying the size and surface morphology by SEM, powder properties by XRD, FT-IR, DSC and drug release study and release mechanism.
3.3.1. Size and surface characterization The size and surface of nanoparticles were further characterized
by Scanning Electron Microscopy (Zeiss EVO LS10; Cambridge, UK). The SEM photographs of baricitinib encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles (F8) are shown in Fig. 8. The size of the nanoparticles were in

the nanometer range while shape of the nanoparticles were found to be spherical. The sizes obtained in the SEM image are not consistent with those obtained in dynamic light scattering studies by zetasizer nano (Malvern, UK). The larger particles observed in the photomicrograph could be due to particle growth either during freeze drying or during sample preparation for imaging studies which involved dispersion of dried particles in the deionized water.
3.3.2. X-ray diffraction study of baricitinib encapsulated nanoparticles The X-ray diffraction study of pure baricitinib and baricitinib
encapsulated nanoparticles were performed to investigate particle nature of baricitinib before and after encapsulation. The XRD spectra of pure baricitinib and baricitinib encapsulated nanoparticles

are presented in Fig. 9. The spectrum of pure baricitinib exhibited several characteristics sharp peaks between 12.5 and 42.5° with very high intensity from 200 counts reaching upto 1600 counts. These peaks are indicative of crystalline nature of the baricitinib (Fig. 9a). However, the spectrum of PLGA (Fig. 9b) did not exhibited peaks which is indicative of non-crystalline nature of the polymer. It has been reported that PLGA composed of L isomers of polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid are crystalline, whereas those composed of racemic mixtures i.e. both levo and dextro rotatory forms are amorphous in nature. Furthermore, PLGA copolymers composed of less than 70% glycolic acid are known to be amorphous (Dinarvand et al., 2011). In the present study, we used D, L-PLGA (50:50) which exhibited amorphous nature in our X-ray diffraction

study (Fig. 9b), showing consistency with the available literatures (You et al., 2005; Dinarvand et al., 2011). The XRD spectrum of baricitinib encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles (Fig. 9c) exhibited non-crystalline behaviour (amorphous nature) with almost no intense peak except 2 broad and diffused peaks with low intensity of approximately 385 and 393 counts at 19.3 and 23.2 degree respectively. This behaviour may be due to amorphization of crystalline baricitinib during nanoencapsulation within the PLGA polymer, causing loss of all high intensity peaks of crystalline baricitinib observed in Fig. 9a.
3.3.3. Differential Scanning calorimetry of nanoparticles Differential Scanning calorimetry of pure baricitinib and barici-
tinib encapsulated nanoparticles was performed to compare the characteristics of baricitinib before and after nano-encapsulation. The DSC thermograms of baricitinib and baricitinib encapsulated nanoparticles are presented in Fig. 10. These DSC thermogram of

baricitinib (Fig. 10b) exhibited sharp characteristic endotherm (melting point peak) at 215.3 °C. However, thermogram of baricitinib encapsulated nanoparticles (Fig. 10a) exhibited only a short endotherm at 55.3 °C, which correspond to the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer PLGA. The absence of a sharp characteristic endothermic peak of baricitinib indicated the encapsulation of drug within the polymer. Furthermore, the drug may be molecularly dispersed as an amorphous mixture within the polymer. The melting point rage of the baricitinib reported in literature is between 212 and 215 °C (European Patent Application, 2018; Baricitinib: API STANDARDS, 2018). The melting point we observed in this study was 215.3 °C, which was very close to the reported values. Likewise, the glass transition temperature of polymer PLGA (50:50), we observed here (55.3 °C) is also very close to the reported values (45-55 °C) in the literature (Pyo Park and Jonnalagadda, 2006,).
3.3.4. Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy of PLGA nanoparticles FT-IR spectroscopy of pure baricitinib and PLGA nanoparticles
encapsulated with baricitinib was performed to find out any chemical or molecular interaction between the baricitinib and PLGA polymer. The FT-IR spectra of baricitinib and baricitinib encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles are presented in Fig. 10. The FT-IR spectrum of baricitinib (Fig. 11a) exhibited several strong absorption bands at wavenumbers of 3203.18, 3117.37, 2847.38, 2256.31, 1857.43 and 1579.41 cmÀ1, corresponding to NAH stretching, @CAH stretching (aromatic), ACAH stretching of the methyl/ methylene groups, C,,N stretching, C@N stretching and C@C (aromatic) stretching respectively. The spectrum of baricitinib encapsulated nanoparticles (Fig. 11b), did not exhibited the characteristic absorption bands which were observed in the spectrum of baricitinib (Fig. 11a), rather two weak absorption bands at 2889.81 and 1760.69 cmÀ1, which may be assigned to the ACAH stretching and C@O stretching of the methyl and carbonyl groups present in the PLGA polymer (Erbetta et al., 2012). The absence of characteristic absorption bands of baricitinib in the spectrum of PLGA nanoparticles indicates physical entrapment of baricitinib in the nanoparticles.

3.3.5. In vitro release study of baricitinib encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles
The in vitro release studies of baricitinib and baricitinib encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles were conducted in phosphate buffer pH 6.8 with 0.5% w/v of sodium lauryl sulphate to maintain the sink condition and to mimic the in vivo environment. The in vitro release profiles of pure baricitinib and baricitinib encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles (F-8) are shown in Fig. 12. The PLGA nanoparticles exhibited biphasic release pattern with an initial burst

release of baricitinib (38%) within 2 h followed by slow release of drug over a period of 24 h (93%). The burst release of the baricitinib from nanoparticles may be due to adsorbed drug on the surface of the PLGA polymer. The drug release during the sustained release phase may result from slow degradation of PLGA in the dissolution media.
The in vitro release data were fitted to various kinetic models to understand the mechanism of release of baricitinib from the PLGA nanoparticles. The drug release profile for baricitinib encapsulated

4. Conclusions
The baricitinib encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles produced by nanoprecipitation method had small size with very low PDI and good entrapment efficiency. In vitro release profile exhibited a

sustained release behaviour resulting in 89% release in 12-h period while 93% over 24-h period. PLGA polymer had more pronounced effect on sustaining the drug release rather than enhancing the solubility of the drug encapsulated. This sustained release behavior may be utilized for the management of chronic rheumatoid arthritis and may be helpful in reduction of side effects by minimizing the dose of baricitinib. We plan to conduct an efficacy study and or bioavailability studies in the animals in near future.

ABSTRACT
Introduction: Psychosocial suffering involves diverse human, social and economic costs. Some 34.4% of workers in Switzerland report chronic stress related to their jobs. Medical consultations for suffering at work aim to maintain--or renew--patients' abilities to make decisions and act following a diagnosis of psychological suffering related to their work; they also aim to help workers return to their workstations or remain there. Workplace interventions by consulting occupational physicians can go beyond the subjective issues: they can be offered to employees, in anticipation of a return to work when this appears feasible from the outset. Objective: To qualitatively evaluate perceptions of workplace interventions and identify their effects by collecting the verbatim statements of employees and their employers. Materials and methods: Qualitative single-centre study of workplace interventions conducted by the Consultation Service for Suffering at Work's occupational physicians for patients seen between January 2015 to December 2017. Nineteen workplace interventions took place, out of 184 different consultations. The verbatim statements of employees and their employers will be collected over a variable timeframe, using semi-structured face-to-face interviews. These will then be recorded, transcribed and analysed. Fourteen patients refused the workplace intervention. Their professional path will be collected for comparison and exploratory purposes. Conclusion: This exploratory research project will provide a better understanding of the issues surrounding work-related psychological suffering and of which strategies support patients most effectively.

1. Introduction
Many studies have linked work-related stress with health status, whether cardiovascular diseases such as coronary diseases [1,2], metabolic syndrome [3], stoke [4], musculo-skeletal disorders [5] or mental health troubles such as depressive disorders [1,6,7] and anxiety [7].
Burnout occupies a special place given the persistent difficulty in defining and classifying this concept [8]. Recently, the WHO organization classified burn out as a problem associated with employment or unemployment and as a factor influencing health status [9]. As the classification states, burn out is a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. It is characterized by three dimensions: 1) feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; 2) increased mental distance from one's job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job; and 3) reduced professional efficacy. According to this classification, burnout refers specifically to

phenomena in the occupational context. Never the less, others factors or the lack of can contribute to the onset of burnout such as demographic factors (age, marital status and children) [10] or personality traits such as neuroticism [11]. Some professions are at higher risk of burn out such as health care providers, teachers and helping professions [12].
In Switzerland, findings from recent studies on mental health among employees have been worrying. Rates of employee-reported chronic stress linked to their occupations rose from 26.6% in 2000 to 34.4% in 2010 [13]. Those figures result from a repeated telephone survey of a representative sample of the active Swiss population in the frame of the European Working Conditions Survey. The Swiss health survey conducted in 2012 on a representative sample of the permanent resident population of Switzerland aged over 15 (more than 21,000 people) showed that 12% of men and 10% of women professionally active considered that their work negatively affected their health. Fourteen percent of men and 20% of women with a professional activity in 2012

had symptoms of psychological distress [14]. These findings are part of a context in which the workforce task
represents 5.042 million in 2017 [15] out of a Swiss population of a little more than 8.5 million [16]. The Swiss labor market is characterized by a high rate of companies in the tertiary sector (76%), with a predominance of the healthcare sector. Small companies are the most numerous [17]. In 2017, the Swiss and EU unemployment rates were 4.8% in Switzerland according to the ILO definition [18] and 6.6% in the EU [19]. Employment conditions are dependent on cantonal laws, employee's contract, and employer's general terms. The average working hours are around 41 h per week with a maximum of 45 h per week for normal working hours according to Swiss employment law. Employees in industry sector work around 40 h per week while workers in the service sector work slightly longer hours. Part time work is frequent, especially for women.
Comparisons between Swiss and (EU) data have showed that the country's workers perceived the professional pressures to be greater [20,21], Switzerland's working environment provides its workers with greater decision-making options about their jobs and better support from their management [20]. In 2015, five year after these results, more than six out of ten employees say that their activity involves high work rates or work under very strict and very short deadlines [22].
The protection of employees' health with respect to psychosocial risk factors is stated for in Article 6 of the Labor Law. The State Scretariat for Economic Affairs provides information and prevention measures such as the production of information leaflets for employers [23]. Faced with a proven case of suffering at work, the Cantonal Labor Inspectorate is competent. To meet article 6 demands and to protect the health of employees, the employer may use associations (stressnostress.ch) or public occupational health institutes such as unisanté. Otherwise occupational physicians, occupational psychologists or ergonomists offer their services in the form of a mandate.
For epidemiological surveillance purposes, Switzerland participates in the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) held every five years by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (EUROFOUND).
Of the 31858 physicians practicing in Switzerland in 2012, 142 practice occupational health, most of the time in institutions with internal occupational health services [24]. Therefore, most companies do not have an occupational doctor or a health management system. Resources must be optimized.
Unisanté and the Community Psychiatry Unit began work together in 2009 to develop an occupational health consultation service specifically dedicated to psychological suffering in the workplace named the Consultation Service for Suffering at Work (CSSW). If it is thought necessary, these consultations can be supplemented by a workplace intervention by one of the Unisanté's occupational physicians.
Different types of work intervention tried to ensure return to work or maintain employees in the workplace. Usually, companies do not initiate these interventions unless a legislative intervention forces them.
A recent synthesis [25] reported on systematic reviews on work place interventions that impact absenteeism and productivity. The overall conclusion is that work intervention that intended to improve both mental and physical health together, psychosocial intervention and real work conditions implementation for anxiety disorders, had moderate impact on mental health. Positive workplace intervention outcomes result when disability management programs existed in the workplace.
A finish study examined how companies manage work related stress in collaboration with health occupational services [26]. It was based on the premise that interventions involving employees, health practitioners and employers, and implementing adaptations to the context of work are more effective than other interventions types. Forty companies participated to the survey. The result showed a lack in stress management and a variable cooperation with occupational health services, sometimes seen as the responsible of stress management and

sometimes not. Overall, work-related stress management activities in the workplace have been conducted in only few enterprises.
Some country like Japan enacted official "guideline of promotion of mental health for employees in the workplace [27]. Consequently, Employee Assistance Programmes (EAP) were developed.
EAP are employer-sponsored systems to help workers who experience mental health problems that may affect their job. Comprehensive EAP engage in identification, assessment, motivation, referral, shortterm counselling, monitoring and follow-up activities and help with a variety of personal problems [28].
An evaluation of EAP conducted in the first decade of the millennium [29] found 42 programs, mostly conducted in the USA. These programs use a broad range of methodologies. The study concluded that those programs produced positive outcomes including saving organisations money as well as positive change in those who sought counselling. Nevertheless, the authors raise the problem of non-consensual indications for these programs and the stigmatisation that the use of these techniques still generates in the companies.
Other workstation intervention models have been proposed, such as "Organisational interventions", and evaluated [30]. These interventions target the stressors in the work environment, rather than the stress response of the individual employee. They aim to alter the psychosocial work environment by changing some aspect of the organisation, such as structures, policies, processes, climate, programmes, roles, tasks.
Individual intervention from outside the companies/organisations such as the ones we practice at our consultation are, to our knowledge, not evaluated.
Considering that the subjective experience, which an employee might report during a consultation, needs to be expanded upon in light of the employer's vision, workplace interventions by occupational physicians were proposed at the CSSW.
When considering a work place intervention, the occupational physician from the CSSW evaluates the following criteria:
whether a poor relational situation at work is deemed reversible,
· whether the employee's perception of their professional situation · can be reconfigured,
How strongly the employee is attached to their job, career, role,
· working environment, line of business, employer and the values
they see in any of these elements.
1.1. The framework for a workplace intervention
According to our practice, the workplace intervention involves an occupational physician visiting a company independently of any established patient-care plan or return-to-work plan (case management).
It does not signify the presence of an ongoing acute psychological disorder, nor the continued need for support from a caregiver for the patient to recover.
Our workplace intervention does not allow us access to the modes of adaptation or collective defences that might appear in the company. As a result, one dimension of the analysis eludes us, and this might create an obstacle to the changes initiated.
Our workplace intervention is a one-off; it does not lead to followup intervention. The employee remains involved in his recovery and will lead pre-recovery contact with his employer. The intervention is careful not to over-medicalise what is essentially an occupational situation.
As to legal aspects, the workplace intervention framework is strict and subject to the rules of medical and professional secrecy and medical deontology. Professional confidentiality is a guarantee vis-à-vis the employer.
After the workplace intervention, a restitution consultation is performed with the patient. It is not an account of what was said with the employer but an opportunity to specify the conditions for returning to the workplace.

1.2. Carrying out the intervention
Our design of a workplace intervention consists of a single meeting between the Unisanté's occupational physician and the employee's management. It occurs with the agreement of the employee, his doctors and the employer. The employee agrees to the intervention in writing either during the consultation or after consultation with his attending physician and/or specialist. The employee must have informed his superiors or management that he is in a care situation and that an occupational physician wishes to meet with them. The patient's occupational physician and general practitioner subsequently communicate and must both agree to an intervention.
When there is favourable feedback from the employer, consenting to a meeting, the intervention is planned via email with the company manager, a direct supervisor or the human resources department. On average, a workplace intervention takes up about 1 h of the employee's company's time. The employee is not present.
After the intervention, the employee comes to the CSSW for a second consultation both in order to clarify or expand upon the initial analysis and to support the resumption of communication with his workplace and management. This restitution respects professional confidentiality vis-à-vis the employer and respects each party's specific roles. It is not about reporting the interview transcript.
If necessary, the occupational physician will have further telephone contact with the patient's attending doctor. The collaborative nature of the CSSW allows it to call upon a psychiatrist when necessary to provide additional focus on the intervention.
To the best of our knowledge, no studies to date have qualitatively or indeed otherwise evaluated such workplace interventions by occupational physicians. We chose a qualitative approach to this evaluation because it allowes for a more comprehensive and precise understanding of the mechanisms underlying the workplace intervention we provide.
2. Study objective
This study aims to qualitatively assess perceptions of workplace interventions by occupational physicians and their effects by gathering the verbatim statements of employees and their employers.
3. Materials and methods
This is a qualitative single-centre study protocol examining the workplace interventions conducted by occupational physicians from French-speaking Switzerland's CSSW. A qualitative design was chosen because of the selection bias involved in consultations. In addition, some of the Unisanté's occupational physicians prefer to deal with situations of suffering at work whereas others deal with cases of more general practice-type occupational diseases and disorders. Moreover, the indications for a workplace intervention depend on each consultant's practices and experience, and those indications are neither systematic nor standardised. The advantage of a qualitative design is that it allows a finer-grained analysis of the information and answers given and it generates research hypotheses that can be tested later using other methods.
From January 2015 to December 2017, the CSSW saw 184 new patients. Nineteen workplace interventions were performed, and 14 further indications for workplace interventions were refused by the patients.
3.1. Population
The present study protocol concerns the 19 patients seen by the CSSW occupational physicians between January 2015 and December 2017 and for whom a workplace intervention was carried out.
All patients consulting the CSSW were eligible for inclusion, whether or not they had a work-associated somatic problem, whether or not

their case had involved a workplace intervention by another healthcare professional prior to the consultation and regardless of the duration their medical care by the Unisanté or another institution.
Refusal to participate in the study, whether by the employee or his employer, will be the sole criterion for non-inclusion.
Patients for whom a workplace intervention by an Unisanté occupational physician was carried out but for whom no follow-up consultation could be made to discuss it, or who cannot be reached with regards to the present study, will be considered as lost patients.
As a comparison, the career trajectories of the 14 patients who refused the workplace intervention will also be collected.
3.1.1. Collection of consent Patients who had the workplace intervention and their employers
will receive written consent forms inviting and encouraging them to sign up and participate in the present study [Annexes 1a and 1b]. A stamped addressed envelope to the Unisanté will be included. It will be made clear that any refusal to participate in the research project will in no way influence any possible future request for medical care by the Unisanté. Participants will be informed of anonymity and their right to withdraw from the study at any point. Permission to tape-record the interviews and use material anonymously will be asked for each participant. In the absence of any answer after one month, a follow-up telephone call will be made, or email will be sent, every month for three months. After this period, no answer will be considered a refusal to participate in the study. Both written informed consent forms will be attached to the patient's clinical record.
Consent to participate in the study will also be collected from patients who have not had the intervention at the workplace (appendix 1 c).
3.1.2. Data collection The study protocol includes a short, descriptive, quantitative com-
ponent in order to better illustrate its qualitative aspects. For the purposes of the consultation, the Unisanté's occupational physician collected information relating to the patient's antecedents and sociooccupational situation [Appendix 2] and noted the recommendations made to the patient in his clinical file. The following data will be extracted from the consultation's medical notes for use in this research : age, sex, level of education, profession, type of company, years in the company, career path, hierarchical composition of work unit, breaks in the career path, medical history and addictions, the professional situation's current impact on health, means invisaged for improving all aspects of the situation, elements indicating the need for a workplace intervention, and recommendations made to the patient.
For the qualitative part of the study protocol, concerning the employee and their employer who had the workplace intervention, we have chosen a semi-structured, face-to-face interview approach, which will last 30-45 min, and be audio-recorded and transcribed.
One interview will be conducted with the patient and another with his employer. An interview guide has been produced to harmonise patients' (Appendix 3) and employers' interviews (Appendix 4). The analysis of their perceptions of the workplace intervention will seek answers to the following questions:

· Did you have any prior information about the workplace intervention? What information did you receive in addition to that from the
· Unisanté doctor? What did you think when you were informed about the possibility of a workplace intervention? Were you reassured, worried or suspicious? Did the procedure for the intervention suit you?
· Was the workplace intervention helpful to you with regards to your · health, balancing professional concerns against personal ones,

support for the resumption of your professional activity, your relationship with your employer later on, and so on? Was the workplace intervention followed by your return to work?
· How long afterwards?
Was a single workplace intervention sufficient?
· Has the workplace intervention helped to stabilise your professional · situation in the company?
How did you perceive the consultation for suffering at work prior to
· the workplace intervention?
Have you had the opportunity to inform your colleagues about the
· workplace intervention? What were their reactions?
How do you think your employer and your colleagues perceived the
· workplace intervention?
3.1.2.2. For the employer
· Did you have any prior information about the workplace intervention? What information did you receive about the workplace intervention from the Unisanté doctor?
· What did you think when you were informed about the possibility of a workplace intervention? Were you reassured, worried or suspicious? Was the procedure for the intervention consistent with what you
· had imagined when it was presented to you by telephone or email?
Did you appreciate the intervention? Was it helpful? Was it suffi-
· cient? Was it followed by the employee's return to work? Did it
stabilise his work situation?
· How do you think your other employees perceived the workplace intervention?
The end of data collection is planned at 15 months from the beginning of the study; the end of the data entry period is planned at 16 months. Data analysis is planned to end at 36 months.
3.1.2.3. For the employees who had not had the workplace intervention. After collecting consent to a phone interview, patients will be asked by phone to give details about their professional career starting from the consultation date. The interviewer will fill in a questionnaire that contains the same topics as the original professional questionnaire (Appendix 5), with emphasis on transitions and their causes.
4. Analysis
A quick descriptive analysis of the population will be carried out using the following variables extracted from the patient's consultation report: age, sex, level of study, profession, type of company, years in the company, career path, hierarchical composition of the work unit, breaks in the career path, medical history and addictions, the professional situation's current impact on health, means invisaged for improving all aspects of the situation, elements indicating the need for a workplace intervention, and recommendations made to the patient.
All the face-to-face interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed in full and read by the authors several times to obtain an overview of the data. Emerging themes will be identified, coded with tags and categorised according to conceptual frame outlined above without a preestablished code list. Similar themes will be combined in categories. Categories will be compared and contrasted in the employees group, the employers group and both. These categories will be used to generate interpretations and scenarios.
Interpretations and scenarios about their professional path will also be built from the data collected by the professional questionnaire of patients who refused the intervention in the workplace.

5. Ethics
This research study, the confidential data generated and its management will be in line with the principles set out in the current versions of the Declaration of Helsinki, the Essentials of Good Epidemiological Practice issued by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, Swiss law and the requirements of the relevant Swiss regulatory authorities. The protocol will be submitted to SwissEthics [31] for validation.
6. Discussion
The present study should lead to a better understanding of which support strategies are the most effective and enable us to better adjust consultations for suffering at work, as well as their link to possible adaptations in the workplace. This study should help us to promote the practice of workplace intervention for the benefit all patients who consult for suffering at work.
Our individual workplace interventions are isolated projects with respect to time and organisational structure, and not integrated into company strategy, as authors recommend [32]. Our approach may result in short term and limited effects [33]. Moreover, a memory bias is likely to occur.
Another limitation of our study is that it does not have a control group. The 14 people for whom a workplace intervention was desirable but refused could not constitute a valid comparison group because of a likely different or even altered relationship between the employer and the patient employee making this patient group not comparable with that of the patients who had received the intervention. We have nevertheless been keen to describe their characteristics and career paths for explorative purposes.
Despite these limitations, this study can help us better understand the underlying mechanisms and factors that could make a workplace intervention successful. From there, other design interventions in the workplace could be proposed. Their validation will probably require to use more robust protocols such as randomized controlled trials.

abstract
Demands for mechanical accuracy of medical linear accelerators are increased due to the stereotactic and modulated rotational treatments. Mechanical inaccuracies affect the size and shape of the mechanical and radiation isocenters. In practice, the mechanical isocenter is defined by the intersection of rotational axes. However, there are no simple tools to check the properties of the mechanical isocenter in 3D. We introduce a new photography-based method for quick and sub-millimeter accurate determination of the mechanical isocenter. The method is based on image-processing algorithm and modified front pointer. The results demonstrate the quick measurement and visualization of the mechanical isocenter. Ó 2017 The Authors.

Introduction
Medical linear accelerators with a rotating gantry are based on an assumption that the rotational axes of the gantry, collimator, and treatment couch intersect in a single point, an isocenter [1]. Therefore, the definition of the isocenter is based on a surface that covers the cluster of isocenter points determined by rotational axes of the linear accelerator. Because of mechanical inaccuracies of the axes rotations it is better to speak about isocenter volume than isocenter point.
According to the AAPM quality assurance (QA) protocol for medical accelerators [1], mechanical and radiation isocenters are recommended to be verified regularly. However, feasible and accurate techniques or tools for QA of the mechanical isocenter in 3D are not available. At present, the mechanical isocenter is usually assessed by two pointers, a front pointer moving with a gantry, collimator or couch rotations and a fixed pointer independent on rotations whose distances should be measured [2]. The distances can also be measured using photo-detector plate if the front pointer is replaced by a laser [3]. Due to the lack of easy and accurate systems to register these distances in 3D with all collimator and gantry angle combinations, these kind of tests does not necessarily reach sub-millimeter accuracy in 3D.
Many techniques have been introduced and published for the determination and QA of radiation isocenter [4-8]. These methods

are often based on radiochromic film, electronic portal imaging devices (EPID) or phosphor panels. However, the radiation isocenter may deviate from the mechanical isocenter [9] justifying independent determination of mechanical isocenter because a small and accurate radiation isocenter can be achieved only if the mechanical isocenter is verified to be stable and precisely adjusted.
Verification of the accuracy of the mechanical isocenter requires an exact, repeatable, and automated method to track changes over time. In the present investigation we introduce a new photography-based method for the determination of mechanical isocenter. A modified front pointer, camera and an automatic image-processing algorithm were used to determine and visualize the size and shape of the mechanical isocenter in three dimensions. The method is based on automated analysis of the series of single images acquired during gantry and collimator rotations. The developed method for quick evaluation of mechanical isocenter with sub-millimeter accuracy produces also trend curves to detect slight temporal changes in size and shape of the mechanical isocenter.
Materials and methods
Technical solution
The introduced system consists of a standard digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera, remote trigger, flash module, modified front pointer, and image-processing software (MATLAB, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA). The standard front pointer (Varian Medical Systems Inc, Palo Alto, USA) was modified by fixing a high-contrast

ball with a radius of 12 mm to the tip of the front pointer (Fig. 1a). This ball is an imaging object and the center of the ball is automatically detected by the image-processing software from images captured at different collimator, gantry, and couch angles. The software also includes tools for image preparation, isocenter visualization and trend curve analysis.
Image capture
In the beginning of the isocenter test, the center of the ball was positioned at the assumed mechanical isocenter indicated by the patient positioning lasers. For data acquisition the camera was placed on the couch and the front pointer was fixed to the gantry (Fig. 1a). Images were captured by using a remote trigger to prevent camera movements during image acquisition. Imaging parameters (aperture, exposure time, ISO value, and focusing) were kept constant for all images. The depth of focus was adjusted to be short to blur the image background thus helping automated ball detection from the captured images.
The first image set with camera on the couch with couch angle 0° was acquired during rotation of the gantry and collimator angles from À180° to 180° and from À165° to 165°, respectively. In the second image set, the couch angle was 270° and the front pointer was imaged using same gantry and collimator angles, except the gantry angles between 180° and 315° to avoid collision of the gantry with the couch.
Data analysis
All the acquired images with corresponding gantry angle, collimator angle, and couch angle were loaded in image-processing

software and the ball was recognized from each image. The recognition starts by thresholding the ball in hue-saturation-value color space. The edge of the ball is then determined using Sobel edge detection method [10] and center of the ball is determined using the circle Hough transform [11]. These circle center coordinates correspond now to location of the front pointer in pixel space. The pixels are converted to millimeters by using the diameter of the ball (12 mm) as a reference.
Using the acquired images at different angles the centers of front pointer ball were determined in x, y, and z-directions (Fig. 1b). First, ball displacements due to gantry and collimator rotations were determined in the gantry rotation plane (xz-plane). Second, the

For y-displacement the gantry angles between 180° and 315° are missing because the couch prevents gantry rotation at these angles.

displacements in the yz-plane were analyzed. The determined coordinates with gantry and collimator angles 0° was used as an origin for both image sets. Finally, the results from these separate image sets were used to calculate the front pointer ball displacements in x, y, and z-directions relative to the previously selected origin.
Feasibility and sensitivity tests
All feasibility tests were performed using a linear accelerator (Varian 600C; Varian Medical Systems Inc, Palo Alto, USA) which has been commissioned for use for over ten years. The feasibility tests were done by using the same front pointer and holder as used in routine machine QA.
Sensitivity of the image-processing algorithm was tested by fixing the front pointer to the micrometer which was used to move the ball 0.2 mm in one direction in steps of 10 mm while the images were acquired after each step.
Results
Sensitivity measurements of the developed tool are shown in Fig. 2 which illustrates the measured displacements as a function of micrometer reading. The excellent correlation demonstrates that the automatic image-processing software detects the ball displacements within sub-millimeter accuracy. Steps in the detected movements are 32 mm which was the size of the image pixel in this image set.
Three-dimensional visualization of the displacements of the front pointer ball for different gantry and collimator rotations are illustrated in Fig. 3a. Measured displacements are shown as dots and the assumed isocenter point (0, 0, 0) is shown as an asterisk (/). Fig. 3b shows the surface defined by the outermost dots of the measured ball locations illustrating that the shape of mechanical isocenter is not spherical. Fig. 3 also illustrates that the assumed mechanical isocenter indicated by the patient positioning lasers is not in the middle of the measured isocenter volume.
Fig. 4 illustrates measured front pointer ball displacements for different gantry angles with 0° collimator angle. The point (0, 0, 0) is the initial setup point of the front pointer ball with gantry and collimator angle of 0°. Importance of the 3D analysis of the mechanical isocenter can be justified by comparing the results from Figs. 3 and 4. The results in Fig. 4 show that all the measurements are within the AAPM's 2 mm tolerance for the mechanical isocenter. However, 3D results in Fig. 3 with gantry and collimator rotations show that there is one collimator and gantry angle combination that yields 2.18 mm displacement for the front pointer ball, exceeding the AAPM's tolerance.
Discussion
Shifts of the mechanical isocenter can have a significant impact on the delivery of the radiation therapy in situations where high accuracy of the mechanical isocenter is important. The demand for high accuracy relates to highly modulated fields and to treat-

ment plans with high dose gradients [1]. Factors such as gantry sag due to the gravity, wearing of the mechanical components of the gantry, and misalignment of the components of the accelerator head might affect the accuracy of the mechanical isocenter.
A robust mechanical isocenter testing system with submillimeter accuracy is needed for the routine QA tests at all radiotherapy departments. Currently, the mechanical isocenter is usually tested using 2D measurements [4]. However, results in Figs. 3 and 4 clearly justify the need for 3D measurements of the mechanical isocenter. The current system could serve as a more acceptable QA tool to fulfill AAPM recommendations [1].
Current system might also be a useful installation and acceptance tool for a new linear accelerator when the mechanical isocenter needs adjustment. These initial tests may serve a basis for later periodic QA measurements. Resulting trend curves might be valuable in predicting need for the maintenance and they may indicate slow weakening in the mechanical properties of the linear accelerator.
Conclusions
The present investigation suggests that the photography-based system for checking mechanical isocenter may offer a requested improvement to the current situation where the assessment of the mechanical isocenter is often neglected due to very tedious measurements. With the new system the mechanical isocenter can be quickly measured and visualized from captured photographs using modified front pointer.

ABSTRACT Arbor Acres Plus male broilers (n = 1,152) were obtained at hatch and allocated to 1 of 6 diets from hatch to d 10 post-hatch. There were 16 replicate cages per diet and 12 birds per cage. Five of the diets were formulated to contain graded concentrations of standardized ileal digestible (SID) Ca at 0.60, 0.50, 0.40, 0.30, or 0.20%. A sixth reference diet was formulated using total Ca coefficients for each ingredient and contained 0.96% total Ca. Available P (avP) was maintained at 0.48% in all 6 diets. Data were subjected to an analysis of variance and the model included diet and block. Means were separated using contrasts to determine linear or quadratic effects of SID Ca and using the Dunnett's test to compare the reference diet to all SID Ca diets. There was no effect of graded levels of SID Ca on intake or gain. Birds fed diets containing 0.60, 0.50, 0.30, or 0.20% SID Ca ate (P < 0.05) or gained (P < 0.05) more compared with birds fed the reference diet. Mortality corrected FCR improved (linear, P < 0.05) as

the SID Ca concentration in the diet increased from 0.20 to 0.60%. Tibia ash percent was greatest in birds fed 0.50% SID Ca and lowest in birds fed 0.20% SID Ca (quadratic, P < 0.05). Tibia ash percent was lower (P < 0.05) in birds fed diets formulated to contain 0.20% SID Ca compared with birds fed the reference diet. No other differences in tibia ash were reported. Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) or retention of P was greater (P < 0.05) in birds fed diets formulated using SID Ca compared with birds fed the reference diet. The AID of P increased (linear, P < 0.05) as the SID Ca content in the diet decreased from 0.60 to 0.20%. The AID or retention of Ca was similar in birds fed 0.60 or 0.50% SID Ca and increased as SID Ca decreased to 0.20% (quadratic, P < 0.05). Regression equations developed using bone ash and apparent P retention estimate the SID Ca requirement of Arbor Acres Plus broilers from hatch to d 10 post-hatch was 0.53 and 0.49%, respectively. This corresponds to a SID Ca to available P ratio of 1.1 to 1.02.

INTRODUCTION
Calcium and P are the most abundant minerals in the body and are predominantly found in the skeleton. Deficiencies of Ca or P or an imbalanced Ca to P ratio result in reduced growth performance, feed efficiency, bone mineralization, and may even lead to death in severe cases. However, excess dietary Ca can negatively impact feed efficiency and P and amino acid digestibility (Amerah et al., 2014). Understanding the amount of dietary Ca and P that are digested, absorbed, and used by the animal is vitally important for bird welfare

Poultry diets are currently formulated using total Ca and digestible, non-phytate or available P (avP). Considerable efforts have been made to determine the digestible Ca coefficients of limestone, monocalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, and meat and bone meal for broilers (Anwar et al., 2015, 2016,a,b,c, 2017, 2018; Zhang and Adeola, 2018; David et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019). Unfortunately, a standard method to determine digestible Ca coefficients for feed ingredients is not currently available and numerous experimental methods have been employed. These include differences in the basal diet (corn or semipurified), Ca or P concentration or ratios, adaptation time the birds are fed the experimental diets, the presence or absence of phytase, and evaluation of different limestone sources and particle sizes. However, combining the current information of

the digestible Ca coefficients for the different feed ingredients may provide information and guidance for future developments of a digestible Ca system for broilers. Recently, Walk et al. (2021) presented the mean, minimum and maximum standardized ileal digestible (SID) Ca coefficients for a few commonly used feed ingredients. Some of these coefficients were then used in the current study (Table 1) to determine the SID Ca requirement of fast-growing broilers from hatch to d 10 post-hatch. Due to the impact of particle size and phytase on the calcium digestibility of limestone (Kim et al., 2018 ), the SID Ca coefficient for the limestone used in the current study was estimated using particle size, in vitro solubility at 15 and 30 min, and an equation from Kim et al. (2019). Furthermore, because dietary phytate can impact Ca digestibility, phytase was supplemented at levels expected to create nearly `phytate-free diets' in the current experiment (Cowieson et al., 2017; Walk and Olukosi, 2019).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The animal protocol for this research was approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of DSM (China) Animal Nutrition Research Center and complied with the guidelines in the European Union council directive 2010/63/ EU for animal experiments. This experiment was conducted at DSM (China) Animal Nutrition Research Center Co., Ltd (Bazhou, P. R. China).
One thousand one hundred and fifty two Arbor Acres Plus male broilers were obtained on day of hatch and randomly allocated to 1 of 6 experimental diets in battery cages. There were 12 birds per cage from hatch to d 10 post-hatch. Each diet was fed to 16 replicate cages. All birds were reared in cages in an environmentally controlled room with a lighting program of 23L:1D during the first week and 20L:4D afterward until the end of the trial. The temperature of the room was adjusted according to breed guidelines. Birds were allowed ad libitum access to feed and water.
Dietary treatments consisted 5 diets formulated to contain graded levels of SID Ca at 0.60, 0.50, 0.40, 0.30, or 0.20%. The ingredient SID Ca coefficients used to

create the graded concentrations of SID Ca are listed in Table 1. The diets were formulated to meet or exceed all nutrient requirements for fast growing broilers, with the exception of Ca. To mitigate any cofounding effects of dietary phytate on Ca digestibility, the SID Ca diets were formulated to contain 3,000 FYT/kg phytase (Ronozyme HiPhos GT, DSM Nutritional Products, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) at the expense of 0.19% available P. To ensure graded concentrations of SID Ca were achieved, a large batch of the 0.60 and 0.20% SID Ca diets were mixed and then combined at 75:25, 50:50, or 25:75 ratios to create the 0.50, 0.40, or 0.30% SID Ca diets, respectively (Table 2). The SID Ca diets also contained xylanase (Ronozyme Multigrain, DSM Nutritional Products, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) and protease (Ronozyme ProAct CT, DSM Nutritional Products, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) at the expense of energy, protein, and amino acids (Table 2).
The sixth experimental diet was formulated using total Ca values for all ingredients and contained 0.96% total Ca. This diet served as the reference diet to compare against the SID Ca diets and validate the estimated SID Ca requirements. All nutrients in the reference diet met or exceeded requirements and were equivalent to the nutrients in the SID Ca diets, with the exception of Ca. No exogenous enzymes were added to the reference diet. All 6 diets were formulated to contain 0.48% available P.
Birds were weighed by cage prior to placement (d 0) and d 10 to determine mean BW and calculate mean BW gain (BWG). Feed addition and feed left were weighed at d 0 and 10 to calculate feed intake (FI). Body weight gain and FI were used to calculate feed conversion ratio (FCR). Mortality was recorded daily and any culled or dead birds were weighed. Feed intake and subsequently FCR were adjusted according to the number of bird days per cage.
From d 8 to 10, excreta were collected daily from 12 replicate cages per treatment, pooled within cage, and frozen until further analyses. On d 10 after weighing, all birds in replicate cages 1 to 12 were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. Ileal digesta (defined as the Meckel's diverticulum to 40 mm proximal to the ileocecal junction) was collected by flushing with distilled water, pooled within cage, and immediately frozen. Left tibias were obtained from 2 birds of average BW per cage and pooled within cage to determine tibia ash.
Digesta and excreta were freeze dried to a constant weight. Diets, digesta, and excreta were ground to pass a 0.5-mm screen and then analyzed for Ca, P, and Ti using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES; Optima TM 8000, Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT) after microwave digestion (method 985.01; AOAC International, 2006). Diets and ileal digesta were analyzed for amino acids using a 24-h hydrolysis in 6 N hydrochloric acid at 110°C under an atmosphere of N. Samples were oxidized in performic acid before acid hydrolysis for methionine and cysteine analyses. Samples for tryptophan analysis were hydrolyzed using barium hydroxide. Amino acids in

hydrolysates were determined by HPLC (Agilent Model 1260, Santa Clara, CA) coupled with pre-column derivatization with FITC. Amino acids, Ca, P, and Ti were then used to determine apparent ileal digestibility (AID), digestible nutrient intake and nutrient retention. Tibias were stripped of adhering tissues, dried and fat extracted prior to ashing for determination of tibia ash percent. Xylanase and protease activities in the SID Ca diets were analyzed using methods based on dyelabeled substrates (Azo-Xylan and Suc-Ala-Ala-ProPhe-pNA, respectively). Phytase activity was measured by Method PHY-102/06E DSM and one phytase unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 mmol of inorganic phosphate from 50 mM phytate per minute at 37°C and pH 5.5.
Statistical Analysis
Data were subjected to an analysis of variance using JMP Pro v. 15.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Cage served

as the experimental unit. Prior to statistical analyses, the distribution platform was used to verify normality. Any outliers, determined as 3 times the root mean square error plus or minus the mean of the response, were removed from the statistical analysis. Growth performance, livability, tibia ash, AID, and retention were analyzed using the fit model platform. Livability data were transformed using Box-Cox transformations in the fit model platform. For all parameters, the statistical model included diet and block. If diet effects were significant, means were separated using orthogonal contrast statements to determine linear and quadratic effects of SID Ca and Dunnett's Multiple Comparison tests to compare the reference diet (control group) against the diets formulated using SID Ca. Finally, the SID Ca requirement was estimated using the fit Y by X, fit special platform including linear or nonlinear models and uncentered polynomials in JMP Pro v. 15.0 (SAS, Cary, NC). Significance was accepted at P < 0.05.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The ingredient SID Ca coefficients used in the feed formulation to obtain the required dietary SID Ca concentrations are presented in Table 1. Physiological properties of limestone, including particle size, in vitro solubility and geological location, can influence in vivo Ca digestibility (Kim et al., 2019). Therefore, the digestible Ca coefficient for limestone was estimated using the pH 3 glycine buffer equation for Ca digestibility established by Kim et al. (2019). This equation used in vitro solubility at 15 and 30 minutes and particle size and was a good predictor of in vivo Ca digestibility (adjusted R2 = 0.98; Kim et al., 2019). For all other ingredients the SID Ca coefficients were obtained from a review article by Walk et al. (2021). Due to the low contribution of Ca in endogenous losses in poultry, Walk et al. (2021) found no significant difference between the SID and AID Ca coefficients within the ingredients. Therefore, the mean of the digestible Ca coefficients for each ingredient was used to formulate the experimental diets (Table 2).
Formulated and analyzed total Ca and P and enzyme activity recovered in the experimental diets were as expected when considering analytical variation and overages in the enzyme premix (Table 3). Initial BW was 49.9 § 0.2 g and not influenced by treatment (P = 0.70) or block (P = 0.77). Broilers ate and gained approximately 17% less than Arbor Acres Plus breed guidelines, which may be the result of the housing system (battery cages vs. floor pens; Santos et al., 2012). Livability from hatch to d 10 post-hatch was 97.9% and not influenced by diet (P = 0.07; Table 4). There was no linear or quadratic effect of SID Ca concentration on FI or BWG (Table 4). However, birds fed diets formulated to contain 0.60, 0.50, 0.30, or 0.20% SID Ca ate (P < 0.05) or gained (P < 0.05) more when compared with birds fed the reference diet. Birds fed 0.60% SID Ca were more efficient compared with birds fed 0.20% SID Ca (linear, P < 0.05). There were no differences in FCR between birds fed diets formulated using SID Ca or birds fed the reference diet. The greater growth performance and intake of birds fed the SID Ca diets may be attributed to a few factors: the use of exogenous enzymes to

improve nutrient utilization (Stefanello et al., 2015), a high dose of phytase to result in nearly complete phytate destruction (Walk and Olukosi, 2019; Walk and Rama Rao, 2020), and a more precise concentration of digestible Ca and P in the diet. The lack of any impact of graded concentrations of SID Ca on FI or gain was not expected and may be attributed to the inclusion of a high dose of dietary phytase (Walk et al., 2012a) in all of the SID Ca diets. The young age of the birds and a high Ca content in the residual yolk sac may be another factor contributing to the lack of an effect of SID Ca concentration on FI or gain in the current trial. For example, the Ca content of the yolk increases by 71% from embryonic d 0 to 17.5 (Hopcroft et al., 2019). Previous authors reported no difference in daily FI or daily gain of broilers fed 0.40, 0.60, or 0.80% total Ca from hatch to d 4 post-hatch, whereas further increases in total dietary Ca significantly decreased daily intake and gain (Mansilla et al., 2020).
Tibia ash percent was greatest in birds fed 0.50% SID Ca and decreased as the SID Ca content in the diet decreased to 0.20% (quadratic, P < 0.05). A regression equation, using tibia ash percent, estimated the SID Ca requirement of Arbor Acres Plus broilers from hatch to d 10 post-hatch at 0.53% (Figure 1) and this corresponds to a digestible Ca to avP ratio of 1.10. These results are similar to those reported by Angel (2017) who recommended a digestible Ca to digestible P ratio of 1.15 in broilers from hatch to d 10 post-hatch.
To validate the use of the ingredient SID Ca coefficients and the estimated SID Ca requirement, it was important to compare the SID Ca diets with the nutrient adequate reference diet. In this regard, tibia ash percent was similar between birds fed the reference diet and birds fed diets formulated using SID Ca, except birds fed 0.20% SID Ca, which was lower (P < 0.05) than tibia ash of birds fed the reference diet (Table 5). These results indicate the Ca and P content in the SID Ca diets was adequate for skeletal development, except at the lowest SID Ca concentration, and provide an extra level of confidence in the estimated SID Ca requirement predicted using tibia ash percent.

Apparent ileal digestibility or retention of P was greater (P < 0.05) in birds fed all diets formulated using SID Ca when compared with birds fed the reference diet (Table 6). The inclusion of high doses of dietary phytase in the SID Ca diets would have contributed to the increase in P digestibility and retention compared with birds fed the reference diet, which contained no exogenous enzymes. However, reducing dietary Ca has also been reported to significantly improve P digestibility (Walk et al., 2012b; Amerah et al., 2014) and in the current study, the AID of P was improved as the SID Ca content of the diet decreased from 0.60 to 0.20% (linear, P < 0.05). Decreasing the dietary SID Ca from 0.60 to 0.20% also increased (linear, P < 0.05) digestible P

intake. Digestible P intake was lower (P < 0.05) in birds fed diets formulated to contain 0.60, 0.50, or 0.40% SID Ca and greater (P < 0.05) in birds fed 0.20% SID Ca had compared with birds fed the reference diet (Table 6). Finally, P retention was greatest in birds fed 0.50% SID Ca and decreased as the SID of Ca in the diet decreased to 0.20% (quadratic, P < 0.05; Table 6). A regression equation, using P retention, estimated 100% of the SID Ca requirement of Arbor Acres Plus broilers from hatch to d 10 post-hatch at 0.49% (Figure 2), which corresponds to a digestible Ca to available P ratio in the diet of 1.02.

reference diet (Table 6). Calcium retention was lower (P < 0.05) in birds fed 0.60% SID Ca and greater (P < 0.05) in birds fed 0.40, 0.30, or 0.20% SID Ca compared with birds fed the reference diet (Table 6). The AID or retention of Ca was similar between birds fed 0.60 or 0.50% SID Ca and increased as SID Ca in the diet decreased to 0.20% (quadratic, P < 0.05). Birds fed 0.20% SID Ca had a lower digestible Ca intake compared with birds fed 0.60% SID Ca (linear, P < 0.05; Table 6). The digestible intake of Ca was greater (P < 0.05) in birds fed 0.60 or 0.50% SID Ca and lower (P < 0.05) in birds fed 0.30 or 0.20% SID Ca compared with birds fed the reference diet. Previous authors have reported no effect of decreasing total dietary Ca on Ca digestibility (Mutucumarana et al., 2014) while others have reported

significant increases in Ca digestibility (Gautier et al., 2017) as total Ca decreased in the diet.
The negative impact of increasing dietary Ca (particularly from limestone) on amino acid digestibility has been previously reported (Amerah et al., 2014). Formulating diets on a SID Ca basis may improve the AID of amino acids by removing the detrimental impact of excess or nondigested dietary Ca. In the current study, the AID of only His, Pro, Leu, Met, or Met + Cys were influenced by the SID Ca content in the diet (Table 7). In general, the AID of His, Met or Met + Cys linearly (P < 0.05) decreased as the SID Ca content of the diet decreased (Table 7), whereas birds fed 0.50% SID Ca had the greatest AID of Pro or Leu and digestibility decreased as the SID Ca concentration of the diet decreased to 0.20% (quadratic, P < 0.05). These results are contradictory to those of Amerah et al. (2014) who reported an improvement in the AID of amino acids as total dietary Ca decreased from 1.30 to 0.51% and may highlight differences associated with formulating diets using SID Ca instead of total Ca.
In the current experiment, there was no difference in the AID of amino acids, except the AID of Pro, Met, or Met + Cys when birds were fed the reference diet compared with birds fed diets formulated using all levels of SID Ca (Table 7). However, FI was greater in birds fed diets formulated using SID Ca coefficients and this resulted in a greater (P < 0.05) digestible amino acid intake of Asp, His, Pro, Phe, Met, or Met + Cys compared with birds fed the reference diet (Table 8). This was especially true at the higher concentrations of dietary SID Ca and the digestible intake of Glu, Ser, Gly, Pro, Cys, or Met + Cys decreased as the concentration of SID Ca in the diet decreased from 0.60 to 0.20% (linear, P < 0.05; Table 8). Whereas for His, Phe, or Met, digestible intake was greatest in birds fed intermediate concentrations of SID Ca, resulting in a quadratic (P <

Interest in using digestible requirements of nutrients, such as amino acids and P, promotes the prudent use of feed ingredients, reduces nutrient excretion into the

environment, may reduce feed costs, as well as optimizes interactions or ratios with other nutrients in the diet. Formulating broiler diets using digestible amino acids significantly improved growth performance, feed efficiency and profitability when compared with the use of

the feed formulation, without exogenous enzymes. 3If the effect of diet was significant (P < 0.05), a Dunnett's Multiple Comparison test was performed to compare the least square means of birds fed the

total amino acids in feed formulations (Rostagno et al., 1995 ; Dari et al., 2005). In the current experiment, while the benefits of the exogenous enzymes in the SID Ca diets cannot be ruled out, the formulation of diets using digestible Ca coefficients compared with total Ca concentrations contributed to greater growth performance and improvements in the AID or retention of P, Ca and a limited number of amino acids when compared with birds fed the reference diet.
Regression equations, developed using tibia ash, Ca or P digestibility, digestible intake, and retention are presented in Table 9. Response variables that are the most sensitive to Ca and P concentrations in the diet are bone ash, growth performance, and Ca and P digestibility. Growth rate and efficiency are optimized at concentrations of Ca that are suboptimal for bone mineralization

(Bedford and Rousseau, 2017; Lagos et al., 2019; Mansilla et al., 2020). In the current experiment, there was no effect of graded levels of SID Ca on body weight gain and the linear impact of dietary SID Ca on FCR or the AID of P or Ca suggest the requirement is greater than or less than that tested in the current experiment for these parameters. However, there was a nonlinear effect of SID Ca on bone ash percent and apparent P retention. These response variables estimated the SID Ca requirement for Arbor Acres Plus broilers from hatch to 10 d post-hatch, when fed diets nearly devoid of dietary phytate, was 0.53 and 0.49%, respectively (Table 9). This corresponds to an SID Ca to available P ratio of between 1.10 and 1.02. Furthermore, there was a good relationship (R2 = 0.92, P < 0.001; Figure 3) between the formulated SID Ca concentrations and the measured

Figure 3. Relationship between the formulated (&) and measured digestible () ileal Ca of 10-day-old broilers fed graded concentrations of
standardized ileal digestible (SID) Ca. The measured digestible Ca was 0.60, 0.54, 0.48, 0.44, or 0.38% for broilers fed diets formulated to contain 0.60, 0.50, 0.40, 0.30, or 0.20% SID Ca, respectively. Adjusted R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.02, P < 0.0001. The analyzed digested ileal Ca of birds fed the PC () was 0.48% compared with the formulated SID Ca of 0.42% or formulated total Ca of 0.96%.

Ca digested by the birds, particularly in birds fed 0.60 or 0.50% SID Ca, and this corresponded to a measured digestible Ca of 0.60 or 0.54%, respectively. However, as the SID Ca content in the diet decreased below the estimated requirements, the AID of Ca increased and this resulted in an 8, 14, or 18 percentage unit increase in the measured Ca digested by birds fed 0.40, 0.30, or 0.20% SID Ca, respectively. Birds will regulate Ca and P homeostasis via the kidneys, bones, plasma, and small intestine (Proszkowiec-Weglarz and Angel, 2013). The extent of how Ca and P are regulated is dependent on the ratio and sufficiency of either nutrient in the diet. In a P-adequate diet, as in the current trial, birds fed SID Ca below the estimated requirement increased Ca digestibility in the small intestine which resulted in a deviation from the expected values. The lack of a need to upregulate Ca utilization (i.e., no increase digestibility) in birds fed diets containing 0.60 or 0.50% SID Ca further support the estimated SID Ca requirement is between 0.53 and 0.49% for fast-growing broilers from hatch to d 10 post-hatch.
In conclusion, formulating broiler diets using SID Ca coefficients resulted in significant improvements in body weight gain, FCR, and P and Ca digestibility or retention compared with broilers fed diets formulated using total Ca and without enzyme supplementation. These results indicate further improvements in nutrient utilization and efficiency are possible with more precise feed formulation applications, such as using SID Ca coefficients for feed ingredients. Bone ash and P retention data suggest the SID Ca requirement of male, Arbor Acres Plus broilers from hatch to d 10 post-hatch is between 0.49 and 0.53%. This corresponds to a SID Ca

to available P ratio between 1.02 and 1.10. Confirmation of these results, the impact of available or SID P concentration, and determination of the SID Ca requirements of older birds and of different genetic strains is required to implement SID Ca requirements as standard practice in broiler feed formulations. These initial results suggest formulating broiler diets using SID Ca coefficients and phytase to nearly completely remove phytate, results in benefits beyond feed efficiency and bone ash, such as improved amino acid utilization and P retention.

ABSTRACT
Introduction and importance: Diagnosis and treatment of dropped gallstones (DG) complications can be delayed due to a low index of suspicion by treating physicians. This delay may derive from incomplete surgical notes that disregard and underreport DG. This report highlights the management of two cases of DG-related abscesses with incomplete surgical notes and how a high index of suspicion can bear positively on treatment results. Case presentation: Two patients, a 62 and a 71-year-old female, presented intraabdominal abscess' resulting from DG from a prior laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). In neither patient did the surgical notes report the occur­ rence of DG. Both patients were treated with percutaneous drainage; however, their recovery was markedly different. In one case, an association with DG was not suggested until after several months of repeated abscess occurrence. In the other case, it was suggested early in the treatment, allowing for a shorter and improved recovery. Clinical discussion: DG diagnosis is hindered by incomplete surgical notes and a low index of suspicion. Im­ provements in management can occur only if surgeons dependably report DG episodes. Percutaneous drainage of DG abscess under local anesthesia is less invasive than a laparoscopic or surgical approach and can be performed on an outpatient basis with or without using various stone fragmentation tools. Conclusion: A high index of suspicion of DG can positively impact the treatment of these cases, therefore, reporting DG events during surgery is necessary. Percutaneous drainage with saline irrigation is safe and effective in selected patients with DG abscesses.

1. Introduction
Dropped gallstones (DG) can occur in 2.3% to 40.0% of laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LC) as a result of gallbladder perforation during surgical dissection and extraction [1-11]. Complications arising from DG have become more recognized in recent literature, with an estimated incidence of 0.04-19% adverse events [1]. Previously, DG were thought to carry no risk for the patient [2], and their retrieval was not considered mandatory during a complicated cholecystectomy [11,12]. Several re­ ports have described many of the possible complications associated with DG [1,3-7]; however, the most common complication is the intra­ abdominal abscess [3].
Diagnosis of DG is challenging and frequently delayed because of an atypical clinical presentation, unexpected locations, and a low index of suspicion by the physicians [2]. Previous reports have shown that sur­ geons frequently underreport DG occurrence [8], which may also bring

about a low index of suspicion. This report highlights the management of two patients with intraabdominal abscesses due to DG in a teaching/ community hospital of the national health system (C.C.S.S). To our knowledge, percutaneous extraction of DG has been attempted in only 12 cases [2,4,9-11,14-16].
This report highlights the importance of recording the occurrence of DG in surgical notes to include this diagnostic possibility in the event of complications arising from DG, with the hope of helping other physi­ cians arrive at this diagnosis sooner and positively impact patient treatment.

2.1. Case 1
A 62-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department with a history of right upper quadrant pain since a previous LC three months prior; she also had recently begun to feel feverish. Physical examination revealed mild abdominal tenderness in the right flank. Diagnostic workup included a computed tomography (CT) scan that revealed a 50 mL hepatic abscess in the right lobe (Fig. 1). The radiologist's report of the CT described an abscess with calcifications, but the possibility of dropped gallstones was not suggested.
A review of the surgical records disclosed a complicated procedure with only a partial resection of the gallbladder. However, the surgeons did not mention dropped gallstones.
A decision was made to proceed with PD. Using a standard Seldinger technique, a 10.5 Fr multipurpose catheter (Cook Medical LLC., Bloo­ mington, Indiana, USA) was placed under CT guidance in the abscess (performed by M. Zeledon/I. Siles). Approximately 30 mL of pus was aspirated, but no stones were extracted (Fig. 2). The patient quickly recovered and was discharged with the catheter in-situ and antibiotic treatment for five days. The catheter was removed from the asymp­ tomatic patient ten days following the procedure in the outpatient clinic.
Two months after the PD, the patient returned to the Emergency Department with fever, pain, and swelling in the skin area at the prior catheter site. The patient was diagnosed with a skin abscess secondary to the preceding PD, and it was treated with superficial drainage of the skin abscess, antibiotics, and discharged home.
A month later, the patient again returned to the Emergency Department with the same symptoms. Further imaging studies were performed during this new consultation, and a CT scan found a second 36 mL subcapsular hepatic abscess in the same area as the one prior. At

this time, PD was not possible because the hospital did not have cath­ eters available, and the patient was treated only with antibiotics. During the patients' evaluation, an Infectious Disease specialist suggested that persistent postoperative intraabdominal infectious loci from the LC should be suspected.
Previous CT scans were re-evaluated with in-hospital radiologists. The image of the overlooked calcifications in the abscess was interpreted as possible DG.
Surgical management was proposed, and the patient accepted. However, due to operating room scheduling constraints in our institu­ tion, the surgery was pushed back for nine months. During this period, she complained of pain in the right upper quadrant. She had another episode of skin infection that required local drainage, which evolved into a chronic skin fistula in the right flank with purulent discharge.
An exploratory laparoscopy (performed by M. Zeledon) revealed the presence of several DG in the area of Morrison's pouch. However, the DG were not found freely in the peritoneal cavity, as they had "burrowed" themselves in the abdominal wall under the parietal peritoneum. The abdominal wall was explored, and several small, irregular, dark gall­ stones were removed. The largest was 1.5 cm in diameter.
Despite removing the stones, the patient presented purulent discharge from the previous skin site with no fever or pain for several months after the procedure. After re-consultation with the Infectious Disease specialist, the patient was placed on chronic antibiotic treatment for six months. She presented accelerated progress and was able to interrupt antibiotic treatment after five months. A final CT scan reported no signs of residual abscess or calcifications/dropped gallstones. At 24 months since the last procedure, the patient has remained asymptomatic without recurrence of pain or abscess.

2.2. Case 2
A 71-year-old female consulted the outpatient clinic six months after an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient complained of right flank pain on inspiration ever since the operation, but previous consultations with the Emergency Department did not reveal the cause. She reported experiencing bouts of chills but no fever, and a physical examination revealed no abdominal discomfort, only mild pain on inspiration. An abdominal ultrasound revealed the presence of an intraabdominal abscess of approximately 139 cc in the right flank. The patient was referred for elective PD.
A review of the surgical records found no mention of a complex surgery, gallbladder perforation, or dropped gallstones.
During the PD procedure, the initial CT revealed multiple small, round calcifications inside the abscess (Fig. 3). The possibility of drop­ ped gallstones was suggested before proceeding, and a large caliber catheter was chosen. A multipurpose 14F catheter (Cook Medical LLC., Bloomington, Indiana, USA) was placed under CT guidance (performed by M. Zeledon/I. Siles)., and approximately 100 cc of pus including multiple, small, round, dark bile stones were aspirated (Fig. 4). After the procedure, the patient was discharged with the catheter in-situ with an eight-day antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) treatment.
Instructions were provided to continue with at-home lavage of the

abscess, injecting 100 mL of saline solution into the catheter, and then aspirating at least once a day. Family members reported obtaining multiple, small, round bile stones during the first two weeks. Three weeks after the PD, the catheter was removed. An abdominal ultrasound found no evidence of a residual abscess one month later. The patient mentioned a dramatic improvement in her pain and general quality of life, with occasional mild discomfort in her flank. At five months after the catheter removal, the patient was asymptomatic with no recurrence of symptoms.
3. Discussion
This case report reveals 1) incomplete surgical notes and a low index of suspicion hinder DG diagnosis; 2) percutaneous drainage with saline irrigation is safe and effective in selected patients with DG abscess. The cases presented herein show the difference between two patients, in which the suspicion of DG was a pivotal point in their management. In both cases, the surgical notes omitted the occurrence of DG; this hin­ dered diagnosis by lowering the index of suspicion of the treating physicians.
Open or laparoscopic drainage under general anesthesia has been commonly used to treat DG abscesses [1-11,14]. Open drainage, how­ ever, is associated with the added morbidity of a larger wound as well as

4

M. Zeledo´n-Ramirez et al.
the risks of complications such as seroma, hematoma, or wound dehis­ cence [7,9]. A laparoscopic approach is less invasive than an open drainage and the DG abscess cavity can be easily identified and visual­ ized [7]; however, it requires general anesthesia. Percutaneous drainage of DG abscess can be performed under local anesthesia. In addition, it is less invasive than the surgical or laparoscopic approach and can be performed on an outpatient basis [11]. Both patients expressed their preference for the minimally invasive option and were very satisfied with their results.
Percutaneous minimally invasive techniques are well suited to small calculi in DG abscesses, which require superficial drainage, antibiotics and posterior stone evacuation with or without using a variety of tools such as facial dilators, stone baskets, electrohydraulic or ultrasonic lithotripsy [2,9,10,14-16]. In retrospect, the DG in case 1 could have been removed with the help of irrigation and some of the stone frag­ mentation tools.
4. Conclusion
DG diagnosis is hindered by incomplete surgical notes and a low index of suspicion. Reports have suggested that surgeons that perform a LC where DG occurred should compulsorily report this incident in the surgical notes, even if the stones were retrieved, and inform the patient and their general practitioner to alert them of any possible complication [8].
The ideal treatment option for intraabdominal abscess due to drop­ ped gallstones (percutaneous drainage vs. surgical exploration) is still debated. However, percutaneous drainage with saline irrigation with or without using various stone fragmentation tools seems to be the treat­ ment of choice in selected patients with DG abscess.

Haploinsufficiency of the sex-determining genes at MATa restricts genome expansion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Kazumasa Oya1 and Akira Matsuura2,3,*
SUMMARY In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mating type of haploid cells is determined by the presence or absence of the MATa idiotype containing MATa1 and MATa2, which encode the transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by rapid turnover, but the physiological relevance of this property remains unclear. Here, we show a direct link between their intracellular levels and sexual stability. Polyploid cells with fewer MATa copies had unstable sexual phenotypes, causing morphological changes and an increase in cell death; these effects were mediated by hyperactivation of the mating pheromone response pathway. Thus, the MATa1 and MATa2 genes are haploinsufficient genes, and the reduction in their product levels causes sex fluctuation. Chromosome III harboring the mating type locus is the most prone to loss in diploids. We propose that the haploinsufficiency of MATa compensates for the drop-out prone nature of chromosome III, thereby suppressing speciation through increased genome size via polyploidization.
INTRODUCTION Because of its relevance to development, behavior, evolution, and diversity, the mechanism of sex determination has been studied extensively. Sexual dimorphism controlled by the sex-determination system is ubiquitous among eukaryotic organisms from yeasts to humans. Genetic analysis has allowed extensive analysis of the regulation of dichotomous sex and reproduction in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Herskowitz, 1988). S. cerevisiae haploid cells show either an a- or a-mating type; mating two cells of different mating types produces an a/a diploid. Yeast mating types are determined by the mating type (MAT) locus, which is located on chromosome III and contains either the MATa or MATa idiotype (Klar, 1987). Mata1, which is expressed from MATa, and Mata1 and Mata2, which are expressed from MATa, are transcription factors with multiple targets that give rise to the differences among these three distinct cell types (Galgoczy et al., 2004). MATa contributes to determining haploid mating type, with Mata1 promoting expression of a-specific genes (asg) and Mata2 suppressing a-specific genes (asg) (Strathern et al., 1981). In contrast, MATa is involved in the repression of haploid-specific genes (hsg) in diploid cells but not in the determination of the haploid mating type (Strathern et al., 1981). Therefore, the sexual phenotype (a or a) in haploid yeast is determined by the presence or absence of the MATa (Hanson and Wolfe, 2017).
Because chromosome III is equivalent to sex chromosomes in other eukaryotes, the MAT locus and chromosome III may be involved in speciation, analogous to sex chromosomes in higher eukaryotes (Payseur et al., 2018). Chromosome III is among one of the shortest of 16 chromosomes in S. cerevisiae, and the most prone to loss in diploid yeast (Kumaran et al., 2013). Although an a/a diploid is intrinsically non-mating, it acquires mating ability upon loss of chromosome III, or when a MAT idiotype is mutated or deleted (Haber, 1974). In artificial hybridization by the rare mating of a diploid S. cerevisiae cell with a haploid Saccharomyces kudriavzevii spore/cell, the complete loss of one copy of chromosome III confers mating ability to S. cerevisiae (Morard et al., 2020). It has been speculated that the deletion of one idiotype at the MAT locus is also responsible for whole-genome duplication (WGD), as has occurred in the history of the Saccharomycetales lineage (Marcet-Houben and Gabaldo´ n, 2015).
Previous studies have shown that the sex-determining MATa products show constant and rapid turnover during vegetative growth, so as not to interfere with mating type switching (Laney and Hochstrasser, 2003; Nixon et al., 2010). Therefore, we speculated that such MATa regulation is also involved in the

expression of the sexual phenotype. In this study, we devised a method of controlling the levels of intracellular sex-determining transcription factors using polyploid yeast cells and addressed the relationship between their intracellular levels and sexual stability.

RESULTS The copy number of sex-determining MATa genes affects polyploid cell morphology and death rate
To examine the effects of decreased levels of Mata proteins on the sexual phenotype in polyploid cells, we generated a series of mutants with altered ratios of the MATa copy number to genome set number (M/G ratio). We then examined the effect of the M/G ratio on mortality and morphological parameters such as size, roundness, and slenderness. In MATa polyploid strains with a normal M/G ratio of 1, cell size tended to increase, and cell shape tended to elongate, with increasing ploidy (aa, aaa, and aaaa; Figure 1A). The aaa and aaaa strains were significantly larger and longer (increased by 1.47 and 2.17 times in size and 1.08 and 1.18 times in slenderness, respectively) than the aa strain (Figure 1B), consistent with the findings of previous polyploidy studies (Galitski et al., 1999). Interestingly, we found that a decrease in the M/G ratio in MATa polyploid cells caused highly elongated, amorphous Barbapapa-like cell morphologies (DDDa; Figure 1A), which is typical of cells under prolonged exposure to mating pheromones or those that display activation of the abnormal/unsuppressed mating pheromone response pathway (mating pathway) (Siekhaus and Drubin, 2003; Tanaka and Yi, 2009; Udden and Finkelstein, 1978). The DDDa cells showed reduced circularity (0.89-0.77) and were 1.61 times larger and 1.23 times longer than aaaa (Figure 1B). Diseased cells were apparent in the DDDa culture, as confirmed by selective propidium iodide (PI) staining of dead cells. The PI-positive fraction increased with ploidy, and as the M/G ratio decreased, the latter effect was independent of the ploidy level (Figure 1C). In comparison, tetraploid cells with complete loss of MATa (DDDD) and only one copy of MATa (aDDD; 6.13 G 2.88%) had a lower percentage of dead cells compared to DDDa cells (Figures 1A and 1C). These cells were not significantly different from aaaa cells in the morphological parameters (Figures 1A and 1B). These results are consistent with the observation that matD cells with no MATa behave as an a-mating type (Strathern et al., 1981).
Since a high concentration of mating pheromones can induce rapid cell death (Zhang et al., 2006), we examined the relationship between the mating pathway and mortality in M/G ratio mutants. STE4 encodes the beta-subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein downstream of mating pheromone receptors involved in the mating pathway; receptor signaling is blocked by the loss of Ste4 protein (Hartwell, 1980). In mutants lacking STE4, the morphological changes induced by a reduced M/G ratio were suppressed regardless of ploidy; ste4D M/G ratio mutant strains were comparable to the ploidy-matched MATa polyploid strains in the three parameters (Figures 1B and 1D), and showed a decreased proportion of PI-positive cells (Figure 1C), indicating that the phenotypes induced by the decreased M/G ratio are dependent on the mating pathway. This result suggests that the DDDa Barbapapa-like morphology is caused by the activation of the mating pathway (Figure 1A).
Because Mata1 promotes MATa-specific gene expression, whereas Mata2 represses MATa-specific gene expression, we expected that mata1D DDDa and mata2D DDDa would show phenotypes similar to DDDD and DDDa, respectively. Unexpectedly, however, the abnormal morphologies were suppressed in the single mutants (Figures 1B and 1E). In particular, the induction of mata1D or mata2D resulted in the recovery of circularity (0.77 in DDDa to 0.92 or 0.90, respectively), which was close to the DDDD circularity (0.89). The increased cell death was also suppressed completely by mata1D and partially by mata2D (Figure 1C). These results indicate that the reduced expression of these two genes is involved in the synthesis of the DDDa phenotype.

Figure 2. A decrease in the M/G ratio causes a decrease in the intracellular amounts of Mata1 and Mata2 proteins (A) Western blot analysis of Mata1-13Myc and GFP-Mata2. Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining corresponding to the Western blot is shown in the bottom panel. The total protein content of the samples was adjusted by CBB staining prior to the SDS-PAGE. With these samples, detection by anti-Myc and anti-GFP is performed in independent membranes. (B) Bar graphs show the relative ratio of Mata1 and Mata2 corrected by CBB staining.
We then quantified the amounts of Mata1 and Mata2 proteins in M/G ratio mutants by Western blotting. Both proteins decreased with the M/G ratio, with Mata2 exhibiting greater depletion (Figures 2A, 2B, and S1). Previous studies estimated the half-lives of Mata1 and Mata2 as $15 and $5 min, respectively (Hochstrasser and Varshavsky, 1990; Nixon et al., 2010). Therefore, we speculated that the different effects of the M/G ratio on the amounts of Mata1 and Mata2 were due to the differences in their respective half-lives.
Finally, we examined the effect of the M/G ratio using a series of ectopic MATa expressed from loci other than the native MAT. Aberrant morphologies were observed at an M/G ratio of <1, with a lower M/G ratio associated with greater severity of aberrant morphology; the introduction of ectopic MATa reversed the abnormal morphology of M/G ratio mutants (Figure 3A). For each ploidy, a decrease in roundness and an increase in size and slenderness were observed when the M/G ratio was less than 1 (Figure 3B). Complementation with ectopic MATa also normalized mortality to the same rate as in the wild type (MATa + 3 3 ectopic MATa tetraploid; 4.92 G 2.99%). These results confirmed that the phenotype of M/G ratio mutants was dependent on the relative copy number of MATa, and indicated that reduced expression of the sex-determining MATa has adverse effects on S. cerevisiae cells.
Cells with a decreased M/G ratio cannot maintain a stable sexual phenotype As described above, the morphology of M/G ratio mutants is associated with the mating pathway. Activation of the mating pathway requires the presence of both mating type cells, or at least the simultaneous expression of a pheromone specific to one mating type cell and its receptor normally expressed in cells of the other mating type. Since the phenotypes of the M/G ratio mutants suggest an abnormality in the sex-determination system, we generated fluorescent reporters that facilitated monitoring the expression of mating type-specific genes. These reporters express green fluorescent protein (GFP) and mCherry downstream of the promoters of MATa-specific MFA1 and MATa-specific MFALPHA1, respectively, which enables mating type discrimination by fluorescence observation. As expected, GFP fluorescence was observed in wild-type (WT) MATa cells, mCherry fluorescence was observed in WT MATa cells, and no fluorescence was observed in WT MATa/MATa diploid cells (Figure 4A). Moreover, no fluorescence was observed in haploid mata1D cells that lost the expression of both asg and asg (Bender and Sprague, 1989), and fluorescence of both was observed in mata2D cells (which express both asg and asg) (Bender and Sprague, 1989), confirming the efficacy of our fluorescence mating type reporters (Figure 4A). We found that DDDa emitted not only red fluorescence but also some green fluorescence, although it is genetically MATa (Figure 4A). This suggests that the M/G ratio mutants cannot stably express either the a- or a-mating type, leading to sex fluctuation.
Our observations with the mating type reporters suggested that not only the pheromone-encoding genes used to make the reporters but also other a- and a-specific genes, such as receptors, were expressed abnormally. We noticed that the mCherry fluorescence of DDDa cells was markedly higher than that of a cells (Figure 4B), suggesting that the activity of the MFALPHA1 promoter is enhanced in DDDa cells. As the expression of mating pheromone genes was activated by the mating pathway (Roberts et al., 2000;

Strazdis and MacKay, 1983), we suspected that, in M/G ratio mutants, pheromones secreted by mutants or their clones bind to their ``own'' receptors, thereby activating the mating pathway even in clones derived from a single cell.
The mating pathway is hyperactivated in cells with a lower M/G ratio Since mating type instability is thought to activate the mating pathway via the binding of mating pheromones to their receptors, we verified the fluorescence intensity of FUS1pr-GFP, using flow cytometry to evaluate the activation level of the mating pathway in the M/G ratio mutants. The FUS1 promoter is commonly used to measure the transcriptional response of the mating pathway (Banderas et al., 2016; Hagen et al., 1991; Paliwal et al., 2007; Takahashi and Pryciak, 2008). Indeed, the M/G ratio mutants had greater FUS1pr-GFP fluorescence, indicating mating pathway activation (Figure 4C). However, the activity of our FUS1pr-GFP reporter was saturated in mutants with M/G ratios of 1/3 and 1/4. The reporter activity in these mutants was much higher than that of the mata2D and sst2D mutants, which are constitutively activated mating pathway mutants (Figure 4C) (Bender and Sprague, 1989; Siekhaus and Drubin, 2003). Thus, hyperactivation of the mating pathway explains the high death rate (Figure 1C) in M/G ratio mutants.
Morphological changes and a high percentage of dead cells in the M/G ratio mutants are not observed after mating with MATa cells Consistent with the mating type instability phenotype (Figures 4A-4C), M/G ratio mutants showed substantial mating with MATa cells, in addition to normal mating with MATa cells (Figure 5A). However, no octaploid cells formed when DDDa was cultured alone, under conditions where triploid cells formed by mating in a co-culture of haploid matD cells and haploid MATa cells (Figure S2), suggesting that the phenotype of M/G ratio mutants mating with MATa cells is unstable. This indicates that the bimater phenotype of M/G ratio mutants is caused by mating type fluctuation, and not solely by chromosome loss, which was reported to occur in polyploid mitosis (Comai, 2005; Kumaran et al., 2013; Mayer and Aguilera, 1990).
Interestingly, M/G ratio mutants showed no morphological changes; despite the increase in ploidy, the DDa and DDDa strains were smaller and shorter (reduced by 0.81 and 0.75 times in size and 0.93 and 0.79 times in slenderness, respectively) after mating with MATa cells (Figures 5B and S3). Moreover, mating with MATa cells resulted in fewer PI-positive in DDDa cells (tetraploid DDDa; 17.78 G 2.92% to pentaploid aDDDa; 10.81 G 3.71%). The Mata1, Mata1, and Mata2 transcription regulators, which are involved in controlling the expression of mating type-specific genes, are rapidly turned over by degradation of control of the ubiquitin proteasome system (Johnson et al., 1998; Laney and Hochstrasser, 2003; Nixon et al., 2010). By contrast, in the a/a diploid with both MATa and MATa idiotypes formed by mating, Mata1 and Mata2 are stabilized by binding to each other and forming an a1-a2 repressor (Johnson et al., 1998). This supports our model, in which the phenotypes of M/G ratio mutants are due to rapid turnover of Mata proteins normally found in MATa haploid cells, and shows that the expression of Mata proteins with a reduced number of MATa copies is sufficient for function if the product is stabilized after mating.
DISCUSSION The S. cerevisiae mating type determination system harbors instability Although it was previously thought that the S. cerevisiae mating type was determined by the presence or absence of MATa (Hanson and Wolfe, 2017), we show that the amount of MATa products is also important for sex determination; furthermore, we found that an insufficient quantity of MATa products induces unstable sex-specific gene expression (Figures 4A and 4B). We speculate that this is due to the rapid turnover of MATa products. In addition to the regulation of Mata proteins turnover described above, it is interesting to note that the expression of MATa1 is repressed in the presence of the a1-a2 repressor (Johnson, 1995). In fact, we observed that, in the a/a-mating type state, a decrease in MATa products was not problematic (Figures 5B and S3), which supports the idea that this phenomenon is caused by rapid turnover. Nixon et al. (2010) discussed that the rapid turnover prevents simultaneous display of both a- and a-mating

type phenotypes during mating type switching, and does not interfere with the definition of the new mating type (Nixon et al., 2010). Consistently, pheromone receptors, which are the most upstream factors in the mating pathway, are constitutively taken up by endocytosis (Davis et al., 1993; Jenness and Spatrick, 1986).
In this study, we demonstrated the impact of decreased MATa products on sexual identity and mating using polyploid cells. We previously observed Barbapapa-like cells when Mata proteins were expressed from MATa on a centromeric plasmid in haploid matD cells (unpublished observation). Since plasmid-borne gene expression is highly variable from cell to cell (Chou et al., 2015), we assume that this phenotype is caused by a shortage of Mata proteins in a fraction of cells with low expression of MATa genes from the plasmid. Thus, we speculate that the ratio of MATa-derived protein amounts to genome size is critical for the stable expression of the sexual phenotype regulated by MATa, irrespective of the ploidy.
Low levels of Mata proteins result in mating pathway confusion In homothallic strains of S. cerevisiae, switching between the a- and a-mating type phenotypes is completed within the span of a single division cycle, and pheromones and receptors, for example, must also be replaced within this span (Herskowitz, 1988). The mating type reporters used in this study were based on free GFP and mCherry, and their half-lives in yeast cells are longer than the duration of the cell cycle (Mateus and Avery, 2000; Natarajan et al., 1998). This property allows the respective fluorescence emission to continue even after the corresponding gene is repressed. Therefore, our reporters represent sexual history rather than the sex at the moment. Taking advantage of this character, we demonstrated that a decrease in MATa copy number in polyploid cells caused sex fluctuation, as manifested by the expression of asg and asg (Figures 4A and 4B), and hyperactivation of the mating pathway (Figure 4B). In addition, hyperactivation was also manifested by strong expression of FUS1pr-GFP (Figure 4C).
Although DDDa cells exhibited abnormal asg gene expression, they still behaved as the a-mating type, as judged by rare mating with an a-mating type tester (Figure 5A) and no conspicuous mating in DDDa culture (Figure S2). Our reporters, which reflect the expression of mating pheromones, provide insight into the specific phenotype of DDDa and the underlying mechanisms by revealing the sexual history. DDDa showed a bias toward mCherry over GFP, i.e., stronger expression of asg than asg (Figure 4B). Furthermore, our reporter analysis revealed intriguing differences in the expression levels of asg and asg between mata2D and DDDa, although the expression of asg was derepressed in both mutants (Figures 4A-4C).
When a and a cells are fused to form a zygote, activity of the mating pathway is attenuated through the interaction of MATa-specific Asg7 and MATa-specific Ste3 (Roth et al., 2000). Our flow cytometry data showed that the expression levels of GFP and mCherry in mata2D were comparable to those in MATa and MATa, respectively (Figure 4B), despite activation of the mating pathway (Figure 4C). This was presumably mediated by the attenuation of the mating pathway through the interaction of MATa-specific Asg7 and MATa-specific Ste3, which is thought to be important in the zygotic fusion event (Roth et al., 2000) and was proposed to occur in mata2D cells (Rivers and Sprague, 2003). By contrast, DDDa expressed less asg than asg, which would result in insufficient attenuation by Asg7-Ste3, causing hyperactivation of the mating pathway. In conclusion, we assume that DDDa, which is genetically MATa, causes pheromone-receptormediated activation of the mating pathway due to transient expression of the a-mating type phenotype caused by a quantitative deficiency of MATa products.
MATa is composed of haploinsufficient genes encoding transcription factors The above-described properties are related to the fact that the two proteins expressed from MATa, Mata1 and Mata2, are transcription factors with multiple targets. In cells expressing MATa, Mata1 promotes asg expression and Mata2 represses asg expression, so that the cells stably express the a-mating type (Strathern et al., 1981). It is conceivable that, if the amount of each MATa product is insufficient, the transcriptional

Figure 5. M/G ratio mutants still maintain the a-mating type, and their phenotypes are normalized after mating (A) Confirmation of mating type through mating with a- and a-tester strains. As selection markers, tester strains have the LEU2 gene and sample strains have the HIS3 gene. On the SC -Leu -His plate, only zygotes could grow.

state of all target genes cannot be maintained. In other words, MATa products have a threshold for the sexual phenotype, and the morphological changes and increased mortality in M/G ratio mutants occurred (Figures 1A-1C, 3A, and 3B) because it was below this threshold (Figures 2A and 2B).
For Mata2 to act as a transcriptional repressor, it needs to form a complex with Mcm1, which is also involved in cell cycle regulation (Herskowitz, 1989; Keleher et al., 1988). Apart from the prediction that the overproduction of MATa products interferes with mating type switching (Laney and Hochstrasser, 2003; Nixon et al., 2010), we confirmed that MATa2 overexpression causes phenotypes such as growth defects (Figure S4). Since loss-of-function MCM1 mutants have a similar phenotype (Lim et al., 2003), this result may be due to the depletion of Mcm1 by preferential complex formation by excessive Mata2. Taken together with our finding that the phenotype of a MATa polyploid depends on the amount of intracellular Mata (Figures 1A-1C, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, and 4A-4C), these data argue for the need to balance the expression of MATa, neither too much nor too little. This is in line with the dosage-stabilizing hypothesis explaining haploinsufficient (HI) genes, such that a decrease in expression of their products causes a decrease in fitness, while an increase in expression is toxic (Morrill and Amon, 2019). We speculate that MATa has evolved as an HI idiotype.

OPEN ACCESS
HI genes are thought to be ``stuck'' in evolutionary terms, i.e., are unable to regulate gene expression in response to gene dosage variation (Morrill and Amon, 2019). The narrow range of expression of HI genes and significantly reduced fitness when they are outside this range indicate that HI genes are highly sensitive to changes in genome size. The accumulation of HI genes on chromosome III is thought to be the result of selection pressure that prevents diploids from losing this chromosome (de Clare et al., 2011; Delneri et al., 2008). We hypothesize that the haploinsufficiency of MATa, which we discovered, also reduces the fitness of diploids with loss of function of MATa or loss of chromosome III. The loss of a MATa locus in diploids would lead to the production of triploid cells incapable of normal meiosis; S. cerevisiae must have evolved such a mechanism to suppress the emergence of such diploids. In other words, we speculate that the haploinsufficiency of the sexdetermining transcription factor genes at MATa prevents diploids from re-entering the mating stage.
The haploinsufficiency in MATa idiotype suppresses genome expansion Significant events in the genome evolution of S. cerevisiae include WGD and alterations to the sex-determination mechanism (Dujon and Louis, 2017; Hanson and Wolfe, 2017). WGD provides the potential for new functional divergence between paralogous genes and creates a reproductive barrier to ancestral species, leading to speciation (Otto, 2007). WGD is involved in speciation of S. cerevisiae, as indicated by genome comparison between S. cerevisiae and Lachancea waltii (Kellis et al., 2004). As for the mechanism of mating type determination, the transcriptional circuit regulating asg expression of the ancestral species was altered in S. cerevisiae (Hanson and Wolfe, 2017). Mata2, which activates asg expression in ancestral yeast a-mating type cells, was lost in the S. cerevisiae lineage, and S. cerevisiae now uses a Mata2 repressing mechanism of asg expression (i.e., expression asg by default) (Sorrells et al., 2015; Tsong et al., 2003). We speculate that MATa haploinsufficiency evolved after the loss of MATa2 because it depends on the mating type determination mechanism that exhibits an a-mating type by default. It should be noted that the evolution of the asg regulatory circuit is assumed to occur at the same time as WGD, about 100 million years ago (Tsong et al., 2006; Wolfe and Shields, 1997).
Despite experiencing WGD, the current genome of S. cerevisiae is comparable in size to the genome of the pre-WGD yeast L. waltii (approximately 12 and 11 Mb, respectively) (Goffeau et al., 1996; Kellis et al., 2004). This suggests a size-limiting mechanism in the genome of S. cerevisiae, which may be the haploinsufficiency of MATa identified in this study. In conclusion, we speculate that the haploinsufficiency of MATa cooperates with HI genes accumulation on chromosome III to compensate for the loss-prone nature of chromosome III and to suppress speciation with an increased genome size.
Limitations of the study This study demonstrated that the MATa idiotype is composed of HI genes and that the concentration of their products is involved in the stability of mating type in S. cerevisiae, suggesting that the haploinsufficiency of MATa may affect genome evolution of S. cerevisiae. Although spontaneous diploidization is a relatively common phenomenon under certain stressful conditions and polyploid cells can be easily produced (Galitski et al., 1999; Harari et al., 2018), WGD occurred only once, about 100 million years ago, in the Saccharomycetales lineage (Wolfe and Shields, 1997). We hypothesize that the accumulation of HI genes on the mating type chromosome and the haploinsufficiency of MATa may explain why WGD was an unusual event in the history of the order Saccharomycetales. However, since our research has so far focused exclusively on S. cerevisiae, we have not been able to discuss the evolution of Saccharomycetales. It would be interesting to address the haploinsufficiency of sex-determining genes in species other than S. cerevisiae in a future study.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table S1. All strains were derived from BY4742. Gene disruption and tagging were conducted using the conventional one-step PCR-mediated method (Longtine et al., 1998). Polyploid strains were created by mating, and their ploidy was confirmed by DNA content measurement as described below. Yeast cells were grown in YPD medium, consisting of 1% yeast extract (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), 2% hipolypepton (Nihon Pharmaceutical Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and 2% glucose (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), SD consisting of 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (BD Biosciences), 0.5% (NH4)2SO4 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan), and 2% glucose, SC supplementing amino acids and nucleobases to SD medium at the concentrations described previously (Maruyama et al., 2016), and SDCA supplementing 0.5% casamino acid (BD Biosciences) to SD medium. KanMX, hphMX and natMX strain selections were performed in YPD plates containing 250 mg/mL G418, 300 mg/mL Hygromycin B and 100 mg/mL Nourseothricin, respectively. Yeast strains used in the presented experiments are as follows:

METHOD DETAILS Yeast strains, plasmids, and media To construct a completely isogenic strain, the mating type of BY4742 was artificially converted from a to a to create OYA38 (BY4742 MATa). First, BY4742 was transformed with YCp50-GAL-HO (Herskowitz and Jensen, 1991), then HO was induced by culturing in medium containing galactose (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids or ammonium sulfate, 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, 0.5% casamino acid and 3% galactose (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan)) at 30C for 6 h. Second, the culture was spread on a SDCA plate and formed a single colony. Third, those responsive to a-factor were selected, and then those losing the plasmid were selected in a medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid.
OYA1 (BY4742 mat::kanMX) was created by transformation of matD with a PCR-based mat::kanMX deletion cassette generated by amplifying kanMX from pFA6a-kanMX (Wach et al., 1994) using primers, MAT del F and MAT del R. Transformants were confirmed by PCR using primers, MAT check F and MAT check R, and sensitivity to a-factor.
MATa/MATa diploid strains were created by rare-mating. To construct a MATa/MATa diploid strain, MATa haploid strains were transformed with plasmids with different auxotrophic markers (pRS313, pRS315) (Baccarini et al., 1983), mixed and cultured overnight on YPD medium plate, and then selected on a SC -Leu -His medium plate in which only the zygote could grow. Then, plasmids were naturally lost by incubation in YPD medium. In the same way, MATa/MATa/MATa triploid strains were constructed by mating a MATa haploid strain and a MATa/MATa diploid strain, and MATa/MATa/MATa/MATa tetraploid strains were constructed by mating MATa/MATa diploid strains with each other. These strains were confirmed to be a-mating type by assessing the formation of sexual agglutination in a co-culture with the MATa tester but not with the MATa tester.
matD/matD diploid strains were created by mating by complementation of matD with MATa-harbored YCpMATa or MATa-harbored YCpMATa plasmid, restoring fertility as an intact a- or a-mating type, respectively. To construct a matD/matD diploid strain, matD strains were transformed with YCpMATa or YCpMATa (Shin et al., 1997) and plasmids with different auxotrophic markers (pRS313, pRS315), mixed and cultured overnight on YPD medium plate, selected on a SC -Leu -His -Ura medium plate in which only the zygote could grow, and then selected for loss of YCpMATa and YCpMATa on 5-FOA medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, 0.5% casamino acid, 0.1% 5-fluoroorotic acid, 50 mg/mL uracil and 2% gulcose) plate. Then, cells that lost auxotrophic marker plasmids by incubation in YPD medium were picked up. Similarly, matD/matD/matD triploid strains were created by mating a matD haploid strain and a matD/matD diploid strain, and a matD/matD/matD/ matD tetraploid strain were created by mating matD/matD diploid strains with each other. These strains were confirmed to be a-mating type by assessing the formation of sexual agglutination in a co-culture with the MATa tester but not with the MATa tester.
matD/MATa diploid strains (M/G ratio mutants) were created by mating. To construct a matD/MATa diploid strain, a matD strain with YCpMATa and a MATa haploid strain with pRS313 mixed and cultured overnight on YPD medium plate and selected on a SC -His -Ura medium plate in which only the zygote could grow. Then selected for loss of YCpMATa on 5-FOA medium plate. Then, cells that lost pRS313 by incubation in YPD medium were picked up. Similarly, matD/matD/MATa triploid strains were created by mating a matD/matD diploid strain and a MATa haploid strain, and matD/matD/matD/MATa tetraploid strains were created by mating a matD/matD/matD triploid strain and a MATa haploid strain. These strains were confirmed by PCR using primers, MAT check F and MAT check R, to have two distinct products corresponding to MATa and matD.

Similarly, the M/G ratio mutant strains shown in Figure 3 were created by mating. First, strains with M/G ratio = 2 (OYA126 MATa ho::MATa), = 3 (OYA280 MATa ho::MATa Chr3::MATa) and = 4 (OYA281 MATa ho::MATa Chr3::MATa Chr14::MATa) were created by sequential introduction of ectopic MATa constructs. Then, the M/G ratio mutant strains were constructed by mating strains having ectopic MATa with each ploidy strain of matD.
In the mating of M/G ratio mutant strains and MATa strain, the strains were also each transformed with plasmids with different auxotrophic markers (pRS313, pRS315), mixed and cultured overnight on YPD medium plate, selected on a SC -Leu -His medium plate in which only the zygote could grow. Then, auxotrophic marker plasmids were naturally lost by incubation in YPD medium.
Since ste4D strains were not capable of mating, pRS317-STE4 was transformed to restore fertility, and ste4D M/G ratio mutants were produced using the method for producing M/G ratio mutants described above.
The mating type reporters are two constructs expressing MFA1 promoter-driven GFP and MFALPHA1 promoter-driven mCherry introduced into intergenic region between SAM50 and SSN8 on Chromosome XIV and HO locus on Chromosome IV, respectively.
To construct cells harboring Chr14::MFA1pr-GFP-kanMX, two PCR fragments were isolated, one amplified with the primers M13U-MFA1P F and NLS-MFA1P R using genomic DNA of BY4742 strain as a template, and the other amplified with the primers NLS-F1 F and Chr14 R using the plasmid pFA6a-GFP(S65T)kanMX6 (Wach et al., 1997) as a template, resulting the two PCR products were MFA1 promoter and GFP-kanMX sequence. Then, the two resulting fragments were amplified using overlapping PCR with the primers Chr14-M13U F and Chr14 R. The final PCR product was transformed into Chromosome XIV (Location: Chromosome XIV 583,958^583,959) and correct insertion was confirmed by PCR.
Cells harboring ho::MFALPHA1pr-mCherry-hphMX was constructed in the same way using the corresponding primers (M13U-MFALPHA1P F, NLS-MFALPHA1P R, HO-R1 R and HO-M13U F), and the plasmid pBS35 (Hailey et al., 2002) as a template.
The FUS1pr-GFP reporter is a construct expressing FUS1 promoter-driven GFP into HO locus. To construct cells harboring ho::FUS1pr-GFP-kanMX, a fus1::FUS1pr-GFP strain was first constructed through the conventional one-step PCR-based gene replacement. The fus1::FUS1pr-GFP strain was created by replacing the FUS1 ORF of BY4742 with PCR product containing the GFP gene and the kanMX marker gene, using amplified with the primers FUS1pr-F1 F and FUS1 del R and the plasmid pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-kanMX6 as a template. Transformants expressing the GFP from the FUS1 promoter were selected on plates containing G418. Next, to construct a strain in which the HO gene was replaced with FUS1pr-GFP, a fragment was amplified with the primers M13U-FUS1pr F and HO-R1 R using genomic DNA of the fus1::FUS1pr-GFP strain as a template, and then using that fragment as a template, ho::FUS1pr-GFP-kanMX fragment was amplified with the primers HO-M13U F and HO-R1 R. Transformants were selected on plates containing G418 and correct insertion of the fragment was confirmed by PCR.
To quantify Mata1 and Mata2 by Western blotting, Myc and GFP were tagged, respectively. Strains expressing Mata1-13Myc were generated by the conventional one-step PCR-based transformation, using the primers MATa1 Ctag F, MATa1 Ctag R, and the plasmid pFA6a-13Myc-kanMX6 (Longtine et al., 1998). Transformants expressing MATa1-13Myc were selected on plates containing G418. Strains expressing GFP-Mata2 were generated by PCR-based transformation and subsequent marker excision described previously (Khmelinskii et al., 2011), using the primers MATa2 Ntag F and MATa2 Ntag R, and the plasmid pMaM189. First, cells in which the amplified fragment was introduced to express GFP-Mata2 from the NOP1 promoter were selected on SDCA plates. Then, cells which express GFP-MATa2 from the MATa2 promoter were selected in a medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid. Those selected were cells in which the URA3-NOP1 promoter sequence was popped out by homologous recombination. Correct insertion of the fragment was confirmed by PCR.
Ectopic MATa is defined as MATa (MATa1 and MATa2) genes introduced at different locus from the native MAT locus. In this study, constructs ho::MATa, Chr3::MATa, and Chr14::MATa were generated to introduce MATa

genes at three different locus, HO on Chromosome IV, intergenic region between YCRWdelta11 and FEN2 on Chromosome III, and intergenic region between SAM50 and SSN8 on Chromosome XIV, respectively. To construct ectopic MATa strains, three strains, each with a selection marker gene near MAT locus, were constructed through PCR-based gene insertion. The downstream region of MATa was replaced with PCR products containing the selection marker gene and homologous flanking regions downstream of MATa.
To construct the ho::MATa-His3MX strain, the PCR products were amplified with the primers MATa down marker F and MATa down marker R using the plasmid pFA6a-His3MX6 (Wach et al., 1997) as a template. The strain transformed with this PCR product is the MATa-His3MX strain, which has His3MX downstream of their MAT locus. Next, the fragment was amplified using genomic DNA of the MATa-His3MX strain as a template with the primers M13U-MATa up F and MATa check R. Then, using that resulting fragment as a template, ho::MATa-His3MX construct was further amplified using the primers HO-M13U F and HOR1 R, resulting to replace HO gene with MATa-His3MX.
Chr 3::MATa-kanMX strain and Chr 14::MATa-natMX strain were constructed in the same way using the corresponding primers (Chr3-M13U F, Chr3R, Chr14-M13U F, Chr14R) and plasmids (pFA6a-kanMX6 and pFA6a-natMX6 (Goldstein and McCusker, 1999)). The final PCR products were transformed into Chromosome III (Location: Chromosome III 170,287^170,288) and Chromosome XIV (Location: Chromosome XIV 583,958^583,959), and correct insertion was confirmed by PCR.
To construct MATa1 overexpression strains, native MATa1 promoter was replaced with a PCR product containing homologous flanking regions upstream of MATa1 ORF and TEF1 promoter or NOP1 promoter. The PCR products were amplified with the primers MATa1 Ntag F and MATa1 Ntag R, and the plasmid pMaM173 or pMaM189 (Khmelinskii et al., 2011) as a template. Correct insertion of the fragment was confirmed by PCR.
MATa2 overexpression strains were constructed in the same way using the corresponding primers (MATa2 Ntag F and MATa2 Ntag R).
Auxotrophic mutations were rescued by sequential integration of the corresponding wild-type genes as described previously (Maruyama et al., 2016). ura3 and lys2 mutations were complemented by PCR fragments amplified from genomic DNA; URA3 fragments was amplified with the primers URA3 up and URA3 down using genomic DNA of X2180-1A, and LYS2 fragments was amplified with the primers LYS2 up and LYS2 down using genomic DNA of BY4741. his3 and leu2 mutations were complemented by fragments cloned on plasmids; HIS3 fragment was cut out by BamHI and XhoI from pJJ215 (Jones and Prakash, 1990), and LEU2 fragment was cut out by HpaI and SalI from pJJ283 (pJJ252) (Jones and Prakash, 1990). Transformants were then selected by SDCA, SC -Lys, SC -His, or SC -Leu plates.
To construct the plasmid pRS317-STE4, the STE4 fragment was amplified with the primers STE4 GRC F and STE4 GRC R using genomic DNA of BY4742 strain as a template. The fragment was cotransformed into the ste4D strain with HindIII and SacI-digested pRS317 (Sikorski and Boeke, 1991), and the gap-repaired plasmid was then isolated from the transformant.
Microscopy Yeast cells grown to late log phase in overnight culture were collected by centrifugation (3,000 rpm for 30 s), and then the cells were observed. Fluorescence microscopy was performed by DeltaVision (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) and Bright field microscopy was performed by BZ-X810 (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Images taken in DeltaVision were captured using softWoRx image acquisition and analysis software.
For quantification of cell morphology, overnight culture was stained with FITC-ConA for 30 min, washed with PBS, imaged with BZ-X810, and analyzed with ImageJ.
Analysis of mating type reporters Yeast cells were grown to log phase and resuspended in PBS. Flow cytometric analysis was conducted with the CytoFLEX S flow cytometer with 488-nm (for GFP) and 561-nm (for mCherry) lasers (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Approximately 10,000 events were acquired for each sample.

Analysis of FUS1pr-GFP reporter Yeast cells were grown to log phase and resuspended in PBS containing 1 mg/mL Propidium iodide (PI). Flow cytometric analysis was conducted with the CytoFLEX S flow cytometer with 488-nm (for GFP) and 561-nm (for PI) lasers. Dead cells detected by PI staining were excluded, and approximately 10,000 events were acquired for each sample.
Quantification of live/dead cells Yeast cells were grown to log phase and resuspended in PBS containing 1 mg/mL PI at room temperature for 10 min. Microscopic analysis was conducted with the BZ-X810. At least 200 cells were scored for every strain and the percentage of dead cells stained with PI was calculated.
Mating test A single colony of each sample strain was picked up with a sterile toothpick and spread as a separate thick vertical strip. On a separate YPD plate, tester strains were spread in the same way. The two plates were incubated at 30C overnight. By replica plating, strips from the plate of the sample strain were stamped onto a new YPD plate through a sterile velvet cloth. Then, tester strains were transferred to another velvet cloth in the same way, and stamped so that tester strains and sample strains were oriented perpendicular to each other onto the YPD plate that already had sample strains. The plate was incubated overnight at 30C, then stamped through a sterile velvet cloth into a selective medium in which only zygotes could grow, and incubated at 30C for 3 days.
Western blot analysis Protein extraction was performed based on alkaline-trichloroacetic acid method with some modifications. 1.0 OD600 unit of cells was removed from culture, pelleted and stored at À80C. The pellets were suspended in 200 mL of an alkaline solution (1.85 M NaOH-7.4% 2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Then, 200 mL of 50% trichloroacetic acid was added and incubated on ice for 10 min. Samples were boiled for 5 min prior to SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Immunoblot analysis was performed with the indicated antibodies, and the immunoreactive proteins were visualized using ImmunoStar Zeta (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.).
DNA content measurement Flow cytometry analysis method were modified from a previous study (Matsui et al., 2013). Cells were grown overnight and fixed with 70% ethanol at 4C overnight. Then the cells were washed and suspended in 50 mM sodium citrate, treated with 250 mg/mL RNase A at 50C for 1 h, and then treated with 1 mg/mL proteinase K at 50C for 1 h. The resuspended cells were stained with 16 mg/mL propidium iodide at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA content of cells was measured on a CytoFLEX S flow cytometer.
Spot assay Yeast cells grown to log phase were counted on a haemocytometer and diluted with DW to 1 3 10^7 cells/ ml. The diluted solutions were serially diluted 10-fold and then spotted onto SDCA plate medium. Colonies were photographed after 2 days.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Statistical analysis were performed using statistical software R (Figures 1B, 1C, 3B, 4C, and S3).
Microscopy image analysis For analysis of cell size, roundness, and slenderness, images of cells stained with FITC-ConA were analyzed with ImageJ. Each parameter calculated as Area, Circularity, and Major axis/Minor axis (Fit Ellipse) in Analyze Particles, respectively. For each strain, 30 unbudded cells were measured.

Background: Understanding socio-demographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis can inform priorities for cancer control. Patients and methods: We analysed data on the stage at diagnosis of East of England patients diagnosed with any of 10 common cancers, 2006-2010. Stage information was available on 88 657 of 98 942 tumours (89.6%). Results: Substantial socio-demographic inequalities in advanced stage at diagnosis (i.e. stage III/IV) existed for seven cancers, but their magnitude and direction varied greatly by cancer: advanced stage at diagnosis was more likely for older patients with melanoma but less likely for older patients with lung cancer [odds ratios for 75-79 versus 65-69 1.60 (1.38-1.86) and 0.83 (0.77-0.89), respectively]. Deprived patients were more likely to be diagnosed in advanced stage for melanoma, prostate, endometrial and (female) breast cancer: odds ratios (most versus least deprived quintile) from 2.24 (1.66-3.03) for melanoma to 1.31 (1.15-1.49) for breast cancer. In England, elimination of sociodemographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis could decrease the number of patients with cancer diagnosed in advanced stage by 5600 annually. Conclusions: There are substantial socio-demographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis for most cancers. Earlier detection interventions and policies can be targeted on patients at higher risk of advanced stage diagnosis. Key words: cancer, demographic, diagnosis, inequalities, socio-economic, stage

introduction
Eliminating population exposure to known lifestyle and environmental risk factors would only prevent up to 45% of all new diagnoses of cancer, and this potential may not be achievable for many years [1]. Therefore, in addition to primary prevention efforts to decrease cancer incidence, current cancer control policies aim to reduce the proportion of patients diagnosed at advanced disease stage. Early-stage detection renders currently available treatments more effective and can therefore amplify the impact of primary prevention initiatives to help decrease cancer-related deaths [2, 3].
However, the evidence about how to achieve earlier stage detection is still developing [3]. The great majority of cancer patients are diagnosed after first presenting to a general

practitioner with symptoms relating to their cancer [4]. In those patients, interventions to improve awareness and appraisal of cancer symptoms could help to decrease the time interval between symptom onset and presentation to a doctor [5]. Such interventions could be further targeted and tailored on population groups at higher risk of advanced stage diagnosis, for example older women (who are at higher risk of late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer compared with younger women) [6, 7] or men (who are at higher risk of late-stage diagnosis of melanoma compared with women) [8]. For cancers with large socio-demographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis, such targeting may be judged particularly appropriate. However, for most common cancers, up-to-date UK evidence about whether socio-demographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis exist and their magnitude and direction is limited.
Against this background, we set out to examine sociodemographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis for 10 common cancers. Our aim was to explore and characterise variation in

advanced stage at diagnosis for different cancers and patient groups to help inform priorities for cancer control.
methods
data
We analysed information on the stage at diagnosis of East of England patients with cancer aged 30 years or over with a new diagnosis of (International Classification of Diseases-10 code): colon (C18), rectal (C19-20), lung (C34), melanoma (C43), female breast (C50), endometrial (C54), ovarian (C56), prostate (C61), renal (C64) and bladder (C67) cancer during 2006-2010. This represents the longest most recent period for which stage information was available with high completeness for all 10 cancers. Together, the respective cancer sites represent 67% of new cancer diagnoses in England (2009) and 57% of all cancer deaths. Anonymous data were extracted from the Eastern Cancer Registration and Information Centre (ECRIC), a cancer registry covering a population of 5.7 m. This registry has an excellent record of registration quality as indicated by measures, such as death-certificate only registrations of 0.02% in 2010 compared with an average national rate of 1.6% [9]. Uniquely among English cancer registries, currently it holds stage at diagnosis information for a high proportion of tumours [10]. As part of the registration process, stage at diagnosis was assigned by CHB and BAR, based on clinical, imaging and pathological information according to the TNM classification [11]. Information on the income domain of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2004 score of the Lower Super Output Area of patients' residence at diagnosis was available as part of the registration record and was subsequently used to define socio-economic status quintiles (1 = least deprived, or `affluent'; 5 = most deprived) [12]. The use of this index (i.e. of the income domain of IMD) is standard practice in UK cancer statistics and research because it avoids the potential for endogeneity between health outcomes (e.g. cancer stage at diagnosis) and composite (multidimensional) deprivation measures already incorporating measures of health deprivation.
analysis
The main analysis was confined to patients with known stage (complete case analysis). We defined advanced stage at diagnosis as diagnosis in stages III/IV. We used a two-step modelling approach, which allows us to examine overall socio-demographic differences before investigating how they vary by cancer [13].
Initially, a logistic regression model was used to predict advanced stage diagnosis, adjusting for age group (65-69-year olds used as reference), gender (men as reference), deprivation quintile (least deprived group as reference), cancer (rectal cancer as reference); tumour type (morphology); and for breast, colon and rectal cancers, whether the cancer was detected symptomatically or by screening (diagnosis of cancer within 90 days from a screening episode defined screening-detected cancers). We used this initial model which only included main effect variables to summarise overall associations between age, gender and deprivation with advanced stage at diagnosis across all studied cancers. Because of interactions between sociodemographic variables and cancer (P < 0.001 for all), in subsequent analysis we used a series of separate logistic regression models for each cancer.
We assessed the robustness of the findings using different sensitivity analyses. We re-ran the initial model using different definitions of advanced stage categories, i.e. diagnosis in stages II-IV versus stage I; or in stage IV versus stages I-III. We also explored potential confounding of gender, deprivation and age inequalities by ethnicity by repeating the analysis adjusting for ethnic group in the two-thirds of all patients for whom ethnicity information was available. We explored potential bias

arising from missing stage information using multiple imputation of missing stage repeating the analysis in a complete dataset including patients with imputed stage [7, 14, 15]. All exposure variables included in the analysis models were complete, and data were only missing for the outcome variable (stage). In this case, the analysis model will provide unbiased estimates of associations under the missing at random (MAR) assumption (that outcome data are MAR given the exposure variables). However, the MAR assumption can be made more reasonable if stage is imputed on additional variables to those used in the analysis. We therefore imputed stage using an imputation model including information on survival, tumour histological grade, basis of diagnosis (i.e. whether the diagnosis was verified with histology or not), and oestrogen receptor status (for patients with breast cancer only) in addition to all the variables used in the analysis models. Imputation variables were complete, except for grade and oestrogen receptor status (used in imputation models only). Survival was censored at 365 days so that a reasonably consistent approach was applied to patients of any age regarding competing mortality risk. For the imputation model to be congenial with the analysis, model imputation was stratified by cancer. Multiple imputation was conducted using chained equations which created 20 imputed datasets.
We illustrate the potential population health impact of the findings by estimating the number of cancers diagnosed in advanced stage in England annually that could be prevented by eliminating gender, deprivation and old age inequalities. Potential improvements were estimated only where there was significant variation. For the prediction of potential proportions, the odds ratio values for patients belonging to patient groups with higher probability of advanced stage diagnosis were set to that of the relevant group with the lowest odds ratios. As more deprived patients with cancer are under-represented in the East of England compared with the England average, we used inverse probability weights calculated using the national deprivation group-specific incidence of each cancer. We focused on the impact of eliminating age inequalities on patients aged 65 or over because this age group includes about two-thirds of all patients with cancer and because of concerns about poorer relative survival and avoidable excess cancer deaths in older patients [16, 17]. Confidence intervals for these impact values were estimated using a bootstrap with 1 000 replications, accounting for both the uncertainty in stage inequalities and the uncertainty in the distribution of different patient groups.
In order to account for the fact that patients may attend the same health care organisation and that some tumours occur in the same patient, we use a sandwich estimator throughout. All analysis was conducted in STATA 11 (StataCorp. 2009, College Station, TX), including using the ice and mim commands used for multiple imputation [18]. See also supplementary file S1, for additional details on methods, available at Annals of Oncology online.
results
In total, there were 98 942 patients diagnosed with a relevant cancer during the study period. Information on stage at diagnosis was available for 88 657 (89.6%) of all patients, and among those patients the proportion of those diagnosed in stages III/IV varied substantially by cancer (Table 1 and supplementary file S2, available at Annals of Oncology online).
Considering socio-demographic inequalities for all cancers together, there was strong evidence that advanced stage at diagnosis was less likely in women and more likely with increasing level of deprivation (P = 0.003 for gender and P < 0.001 for deprivation, Table 2). Advanced stage also varied by age (P < 0.001), being more likely in older age. There was strong evidence that the associations between advanced stage at

associations between age and stage at diagnosis varied greatly between cancers (Figure 2). Older patients with melanoma, prostate, endometrial and breast cancer were more likely to be diagnosed in advanced stage compared with patients aged 65-69 (P = 0.01 for endometrial and P < 0.001 for others). Conversely, older patients with bladder, lung and renal cancer were less likely to be diagnosed in advanced stage compared with 65-69-year-old patients (P = 0.002, P < 0.001, and P = 0.009, respectively).
The sensitivity analysis (carried out using the initial model) produced overall similar findings (supplementary files S3-S6, available at Annals of Oncology online). Multiple imputation produced similar findings to those obtained by complete case analysis for gender, deprivation and age inequalities, although it indicated a slight underestimation of associations with advanced stage diagnosis in older patients.
In England, there are 186 000 new diagnoses for the 10 studied cancers every year (2009), and we estimated (see Methods) that 73 000 (39%) of those cancers are diagnosed in advanced stage currently. For the seven cancers with evidence of socio-demographic variation in stage at diagnosis there are 146 000 new diagnoses, and we estimated that 52 000 (36%) of those cancers are diagnosed in advanced stage currently. If it were possible to eliminate all gender, deprivation and old age inequalities in stage at diagnosis, there would be 5600 fewer cases diagnosed in advanced stage in England annually (Table 4) representing 3% of all diagnoses of the 10 studied cancers. Alternatively, this figure represents an 8% reduction in the advanced stage cases of all 10 studied cancers, or an 11% reduction in the advanced stage cases of the seven cancers for which there was evidence of potential gains in early stage diagnosis. Prostate, melanoma and endometrial cancer have the largest proportional early diagnosis gains. About 5000 of those tumours (90%)

comprise reductions in advanced stage at diagnosis for prostate (2000 cancers), breast (1000 cancers), lung (1300 cancers) and melanoma (700 cancers), with colon, rectal and ovarian cancer contributing no cases.
discussion
We found substantial and potentially avoidable gender, deprivation and age inequalities in advanced stage diagnosis of seven common cancers and relatively limited sociodemographic variation in stage at diagnosis of three other cancers. Among cancers with substantial inequalities, the size and direction of differences in advanced stage diagnosis varied greatly by cancer. The results were robust to various assumptions investigated with sensitivity analyses, including adjustment for ethnic group. Multiple imputation of missing stage indicated that the effect of age in older patients may have been slightly underestimated. Potential elimination of sociodemographic inequalities could help diagnose a substantial number of patients with cancer in earlier stage. Although, in absolute terms, most of these earlier detection gains relate to four common cancers, there are also notable relative gains for endometrial cancer.
The findings should be interpreted taking into account evidence about the socio-demographic differences in awareness and appraisal of cancer symptoms; and on the promptness by which cancer is suspected in symptomatic patients with different cancers. For melanoma, breast and endometrial cancers the observed socio-demographic inequalities in advanced stage at diagnosis are unlikely to reflect delays in suspecting and investigating cancer after symptomatic presentation to a doctor: these cancers are among the `easiest to suspect and diagnose' and delays after presentation are limited [13, 19]. Therefore, inequalities in stage at diagnosis for those three cancers are likely to reflect socio-demographic differences in awareness and interpretation of cancer symptoms which have been previously described [20-22].
For lung, renal and bladder cancer, we observed `negative' age gradients in advanced stage at diagnosis among patients aged 65 or over (older patients having lower probability of diagnosis at advanced stage). Similar associations between older age and stage at diagnosis of lung cancer have been reported previously in both related and other patient populations [7, 19, 23]. These findings are unlikely to reflect improved awareness and appraisal of cancer symptoms for lung, renal and bladder cancer in older compared with younger patients. Healthcare factors however may be implicated. Older patients tend to have more co-morbidities, which may lead to incidental identification of lung or renal cancers through imaging investigations (e.g. by chest X-ray or abdominal ultrasound, respectively, for symptoms unrelated to cancer). This may reflect a paradoxical apparent benefit of increasing level of co-morbidity, similar to other improvements in care reported for patients with multiple conditions [24]. An alternative explanation may be that these patterns reflect cognitive or psychological barriers by the doctors in suspecting cancer in middle-aged patients.

*The models for these eight cancers (i.e. colon, rectal, lung, melanoma, female breast, ovarian, renal and bladder cancer) were adjusted for tumour type, gender
and screening detection status (as applicable) and age and deprivation. Deprivation was treated as a continuous variable. Age was treated as two continuous variables (above and below the reference group) included together in the model (see also supplementary file S1, available at Annals of Oncology online). The model for endometrial cancer was adjusted for tumour type and linear terms for young and old age groups (see footnote * above). For deprivation, both a linear and a squared term were included, given evidence that such parameterisation improved model fit (P = 0.023). The presented odds ratio values for each deprivation group are derived by the combination of the linear and the squared terms [i.e. odds ratio = 1.48 (95% CI 1.12-1.95) and odds ratio = 0.92 (95% CI 0.86-0.99), respectively]. The model for prostate cancer was adjusted for tumour type and linear terms for deprivation category and young age group (see footnote * above). Old age group was treated as a categorical variable, because of strong evidence that such parameterisation improved model fit (<0.001). CI, Confidence Interval.

symptoms before specialist referral exist (with younger patients more likely to be referred to hospital less promptly)--such patterns also exist for patients with lung, renal and bladder cancer [13]. Another hypothesis is that these three cancers have more (and perhaps more specific) symptoms in older age.

Given that there is no robust evidence to explain the inverse age inequalities in the stage at diagnosis of lung, renal and bladder cancer, research to establish the causes of these patterns should be considered a priority. If the mechanisms responsible for these inequalities are better understood, interventions to reduce

*Details are provided in Methods section. Note that the estimated potential combined impact of eliminating inequalities in stage at diagnosis by gender, deprivation and old age is not equal to the sum of the individual impacts because certain individuals may be subject to more than one inequality. No data shown for colon, rectal and ovarian cancer, because of no evidence of socio-demographic variation by gender (as applicable), deprivation or old age group (see Table 3).

advanced stage diagnosis in middle-aged patients with lung, renal and bladder cancer may be feasible.
The findings substantially amplify previous research [7, 23, 25-33]. Particular strengths of the present study are that it encompasses several common cancers; it examines old age alongside other socio-demographic inequalities; it takes into account potential confounding by tumour type, ethnicity and (for breast, colon and rectal cancer) screening detection status; it uses highly complete stage information and explores potential bias arising from missing information in sensitivity analysis; and it illustrates the population health impact of eliminating socio-demographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis. Adjustment for tumour type minimises the potential

for confounding of socio-demographic differences in stage at diagnosis by socio-demographic differences in tumour morphology because of differential prior long-term exposure to risk factors.
An important limitation is that (unlike adjusting for breast and colorectal screening status), it was not possible to adjust for whether patients with prostate cancer were diagnosed with or without symptoms [e.g. because of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in asymptomatic men]. There is ongoing uncertainty about the potential benefits of asymptomatic detection of prostate cancer [34]. Although the uptake of PSA testing in the UK is overall low, it is higher among older and least deprived patients [35]. Consequently, among symptomatic

patients, deprivation gradients in advanced stage of prostate cancer may be lower than those observed in our study; conversely, old age gradients may indeed be larger than those estimated by our study. Therefore, we urge caution against the potential for the prostate cancer findings to be dismissed as clinically unimportant. Melanoma, breast and prostate cancer in England have higher incidence among patients with higher socio-economic status [36], and it is likely that the observed higher frequency of advanced stage at diagnosis among more deprived patients partly reflects over-diagnosis of nonadvanced stage disease among the more affluent patients.
A further limitation is the lack of availability of national data with similarly high complete information on stage for the studied cancers and period: this prevented expanding the analysis to a wider population. The relatively small number of patients for some rarer cancers may have prevented the detection of moderate or small inequalities in stage at diagnosis (e.g. this may apply to gender and deprivation differences in stage at diagnosis of bladder cancer, Table 3). Incidence patterns by age and gender between the study population and England are very similar. However, there are relative fewer patients with cancer in the most deprived group in the study population. For this reason, weights accounting for this difference were used in the estimation of the population health impact of eliminating socio-demographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis.
Among the seven cancers with substantial sociodemographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis, the size and direction of these associations varied widely. This complexity may signal a substantial potential for achieving earlier detection by targeting interventions to improve awareness and appraisal of cancer signs and symptoms on specific population groups [6, 8]. Policymakers could consider targeted approaches focusing either on a cancer or a specific population group. For example, given strong deprivation, old age and gender inequalities for this cancer, melanoma awareness interventions could particularly target more deprived old men. Among older people, interventions may specifically focus on improving awareness and appraisal of symptoms and signs of cancers associated with age inequality as a `bundle' (e.g. `breast and endometrial cancer' awareness interventions for older women, or `melanoma and prostate' cancer awareness interventions for older men). National strategies can combine both cancer and population group approaches. Development and validation of new, tailored and more effective awareness interventions is likely to be required [6], given the persistence over time of some of these inequalities [21].
The absence of socio-demographic variation in stage at diagnosis of three cancers (colon, rectal and ovarian cancer) should not be interpreted as an indication that patient awareness interventions for those three cancers are not justified. Such interventions are currently being implemented for colorectal cancer [37], while evidence increasingly supports their consideration for ovarian cancer [38]. The findings need to be interpreted in relation to their temporal context (2006- 2010). Evidence from breast cancer and melanoma which both benefited from long-standing awareness campaigns indicates that when such interventions are effective [39], they tend to also generate health inequalities (younger and more affluent

original articles
people typically being able to benefit more so than older and less affluent people) [40]. Avoiding potential inequality that can be generated by future effective patient awareness campaigns about colorectal and ovarian cancer presents a challenge.
In conclusion, for most cancers, there are appreciable sociodemographic inequalities in stage at diagnosis, and this realisation can help motivate and support targeting of interventions on patients at higher risk.

Abstract: Few studies have investigated the association between tuberculosis (TB) and Parkinson disease (PD). This nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study investigated the risk of PD in patients with TB.
We selected patients newly diagnosed with TB (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification: 011) from 2000 to 2009 in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database as the TB cohort. The comparison cohort (the non-TB cohort) was frequency matched to the TB cohort at a ratio of 4:1 by sex, age, and the index date. We analyzed the risks of PD by using Cox proportional hazard regression models.
A total of 121,951 patients with TB and 487,800 non-TB controls were enrolled in this study. The TB cohort had a 1.38-fold risk of PD compared with the non-TB cohort after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities (aHR, 95% CI: 1.30-1.46). The adjusted risk of PD in the TB and non-TB

cohorts increased in subgroups regardless of age, sex, and comorbidities. Combined effect of TB and comorbidities on the risk of PD were significant in patients with TB who had diabetes (aHR: 2.26, 95% CI: 2.02-2.52), hypertension (aHR: 2.23, 95% CI: 2.04-2.44), head injury (aHR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.95-2.77), chronic kidney disease (aHR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.49- 2.72), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aHR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.66- 2.05), depression (aHR: 4.66, 95% CI: 3.59-6.05), dementia (aHR: 3.70, 95% CI: 2.99-4.59), and stroke (aHR: 2.56, 95% CI: 2.28-2.87). The risk of PD was higher in a follow-up within 1 year (aHR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.58- 2.00) and decreased with the follow-up period in the TB cohort.
Patients with TB have an independently 1.38-fold risk of PD. The risk of PD decreased with the follow-up period in the TB cohort. Physicians should be aware of the risk of PD in patients with TB when treating such patients.

INTRODUCTION
T uberculosis (TB), a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains one of the most crucial public health issues worldwide.1 The World Health Organization Global Tuberculosis Report estimated that approximately 9.0 million people developed TB in 2013.1 TB is characterized by intracellular survival strategies of tubercle bacilli2 that results in chronic pulmonary inflammation and release of proinflammatory cytokines.3 In addition to pulmonary consequences such as bronchiectasis, pleural fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),4,5 TB is also associated with nonpulmonary diseases including malignancy,6 ischemic stroke,7 acute coronary syndrome,8 chronic kidney disease (CKD),9 and depression.10
Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressively neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both motor and nonmotor manifestations such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, postural instability, autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and sensory and sleep difficulties.11 The prevalence of PD in industrialized countries is estimated to be 0.3% in the general population and approximately 1% in people older than 60 years,12 which causes substantially increased economic burden and mortality in the United States and Europe.13,14 Aging, genetic susceptibility, and numerous environmental factors play a role in the onset of PD.15,16 Epidemiologic studies have shown that diabetes,17 hypertension,18 head injury,19 CKD,20 COPD,21 depression,22 dementia,23 and stroke24 are associated with the PD.

Infectious diseases may contribute to PD development.25-32 Acute parkinsonian has been reported in subjects infected with influenza virus.26,27 A case-control study has disclosed that PD is significantly related to several infections including mumps, scarlet fever, influenza, whooping cough, and herpes simplex.28 Another nationwide population study has shown an association between central nervous system (CNS) infections and a higher future risk of PD.29 Recently, a positive epidemiological association between hepatitis C virus infection and PD has been found.30 Moreover, some studies have also demonstrated that Helicobacter pylori, a pathogen on the luminal surface of the gastric epithelium, correlates with high PD severity.31,32
A large TB treatment trial conducted in the United States and Canada has shown a low mortality rate directly caused by TB.33 Because TB is representative of chronic infection,2 we consider that systemic manifestations other than mortality, such as neurodegenerative diseases, should be a concern. Taiwan remains a TB-endemic area. In 2008, the TB incidence was 62 per 100,000 population, but the TB mortality was only 3.3 per 100,000 population.34 Few studies have examined the association between TB and PD. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide, population-based cohort study to investigate whether TB increases the risk of PD.
METHODS
Data Source Thirteen insurance programs were reorganized into the
nationwide, single-payer Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) program in 1995, and the NHI program covered 99%

of 23 million Taiwan residents in 2000. After the Taiwan NHI program was established, claims data were collected and compiled in a large, computerized database, the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). The claims data include registry for beneficiaries, registry for catastrophic illness, and registry for contracted medical facilities and are updated every year. The NHIRD is maintained and made accessible for scientific research purposes by the National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan. We used all inpatient files from 1 subset of the NHIRD to sample the study population. These specific subject datasets are including all the inpatient information of Taiwan residents from 1996 to 2011 (source: http://nhird.nhri.org.tw/en/Data_Subsets.html). The diseases in inpatient files are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM).
To ensure patient privacy, the original identification numbers are removed from NHIRD data before release for research purposes. This study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of China Medical University (CMUH104-REC2-115).
Study Population This population-based retrospective cohort study investi-
gated the association between the risk of PD (ICD-9-CM: 332) and TB (ICD-9-CM: 011). Figure 1 shows a flowchart of patient selection. There are 200,552 patients with TB diagnosis in this database from 1996 to 2011. The TB cohort comprised patients newly diagnosed with TB (n ¼ 121,222) from 2000 to 2009, and then excluded TB patients with PD diagnosis date before the date of TB diagnosis (n ¼ 3271) and missing information on sex

or age (n ¼ 0). There are 121,951 TB patients enrolled in the TB cohort. The index date was defined as the date of TB diagnosis. For each TB case, we randomly selected 4 persons without medical claims for TB care, frequency matching with age (every 5-year span), and sex of individuals in the non-TB cohort in the same period. The index year of entry for a subject eligible for this study was the same year on which the individual was identified and included in the study cohort from the claims data. The exclusion criteria of non-TB cohort were the same as the TB cohort. After the frequency matching method, the number of non-TB cohort is 487,800. Patients were followed up from the index date to PD diagnosis, withdrawal from the NHI program, or December 31, 2011.
We also considered confounding factors other than demographic factors; that is, the history of coexisting conditions such as diabetes (ICD-9-CM: 250), hypertension (ICD-9-CM: 401- 405), head injury (ICD-9-CM: 310.2, 800, 801, 803, 804, 850, 851, 853, and 854), CKD (ICD-9-CM: 585), COPD (ICD-9CM: 490-492, 494, and 496), depression (ICD-9-CM: 296.2, 296.3, 296.82, 300.4, and 311), dementia (ICD-9-CM: 290, 294.1, and 331.0), and stroke (ICD-9-CM: 430-438). Conditions diagnosed before the index date were considered comorbidities.
Statistical Analyses The SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used
for all data management and statistical analyses. The Student t test was used to analyze the difference in the continuous variable of age between both cohorts, and the results are presented as the mean and standard deviation (SD). The x2 test was used to analyze the difference in categorical variables, including sex, age group, and comorbidity history, between the TB and non-TB cohorts. The cumulative incidences of PD were calculated for the study cohorts by using the following formula:

dividing the number of PD events by the sum of follow-up years (per 1000 person-yr). The cumulative incidence curves of PD were created using the Kaplan-Meier method and tested for differences by using the log rank test. Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of PD in the TB and non-TB cohorts.
To control the confounding risk factors, the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models when the crude hazard ratios (crude HRs) of PD was achieved the statistically significant effect in particularly risk factor. P values <0.05 indicated significance for 2-sided tests.
RESULTS Table 1 shows a comparison of demographics and comorbidities between the TB and non-TB cohorts. The cohorts had a similar mean age (63 y; SD, 19.4) and similar sex ratios (men, 71.9%) after frequency matching. The TB cohort had a higher prevalence of comorbidities than the non-TB cohort did. Table 2 shows the risk of PD in each different risk factor. These risk factors were selected for adjustment because they presented the statistically significant effect in PD, including sex, age groups (age <65-year old; age !65-year old), TB, diabetes, hypertension, head injury, CKD, COPD, depression, dementia, and stroke (crude HR P value <0.001). After adjusted by multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, the aHR of PD was higher 1.25-fold in women than in men. The risk of PD got increased with age (aHR ¼ 11.1, 95% CI: 10.2-12.1 for !65-year old). The risk of PD was great than subject without particularly comorbidity, for example: diabetes patient had 1.15-fold risk of PD than non-diabetes patient (95% CI: 1.08-1.23). By the end of the follow-up period, the cumulative incidence of PD was higher in the TB cohort than in the non-TB cohort (log rank test P value <0.0001, Figure 2).

Table 3 illustrates that the incidence rate of PD was higher in the TB cohort (2.83 per 1000 person-yr) than in the non-TB cohort (2.38 per 1000 person-yr), and the IRR of PD was 1.19fold (95% CI: 1.17-1.22) higher in the TB cohort than in the non-TB cohort. After adjustment for age, sex, and all comorbidities, patients with TB had a 1.38-fold increased risk of PD compared with the people without TB (aHR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.30-1.46). Sex-stratified analysis showed that the risk of PD was higher in men with TB than in men without TB (aHR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.25-1.44) and higher in women with TB than in women without TB (aHR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.31-1.66). The agespecific incidence of PD increased with age in both cohorts, with the highest incidence in patients with TB aged older than 65 years (5.76 per 1000 person-yr). Age-stratified analysis showed a higher risk of PD in patients with TB than in people without TB for ages <65 years (aHR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.40-2.03) and !65 years (aHR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.14-1.30). Compared with patients in the non-TB cohort without comorbidity, the risk of PD was higher in those in the TB cohort without comorbidity (aHR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.21-1.47). Patients in the TB cohort with

comorbidity had a 1.32-fold higher risk of PD (95% CI: 1.22- 1.42) compared with those in the non-TB cohort with comorbidity.
Table 4 shows the combined effect of TB and comorbidities on the risk of PD in relation to a reference group without TB and comorbidities. Most comorbidities without TB diagnosis were presented higher risk of PD such as diabetes (aHR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.37-1.58), hypertension (aHR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.47-1.63), CKD (aHR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.48-2.10), depression (aHR: 2.89, 95% CI: 2.43-3.45), dementia (aHR: 2.78, 95% CI: 2.41-3.20), and stroke (aHR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.72-1.96). We observed the greatest risk of PD occurrence than reference group in TB with coexistent comorbidity such as TB with diabetes (aHR: 2.26, 95% CI: 2.02-2.52), hypertension (aHR: 2.23, 95% CI: 2.04-2.44), head injury (aHR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.95-2.77), CKD (aHR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.49-2.72), COPD (aHR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.66-2.05), depression (aHR: 4.66, 95% CI: 3.59-6.05), dementia (aHR: 3.70, 95% CI: 2.99-4.59), and stroke (aHR: 2.56, 95% CI: 2.28- 2.87), respectively.

Tuberculosis and Parkinson Disease

FIGURE 2. The cumulative incidence of Parkinson disease was higher in the TB cohort than in the non-TB cohort (log rank test P value <0.0001.
Table 5 presents the risk of PD in patients with TB stratified by the follow-up period. The aHR was calculated according to the follow-up period from the index date to the date of PD diagnosis. We observed that the aHR was 1.78-fold (95% CI: 1.58-2.00) higher in the TB cohort than in the non-TB cohort for a follow-up period within 1 year. Compared with the non-TB cohort, the aHR of PD was 1.35 (95% CI: 1.24-1.47) in the TB cohort for a follow-up duration of 1 to 5 years. The aHR of PD decreased with the follow-up period in the TB cohort.
DISCUSSION This is the first nationwide, population-based cohort study to investigate the association between TB and PD. After adjustment for sex, age, and comorbidities, a Cox proportional hazard

model showed that patients with TB had a 1.38-fold higher risk
of PD compared with the general population.
We observed that patients with TB had a significantly
higher PD incidence than did those without TB, regardless of
sex, age, and comorbidities (Table 3). These findings strength-
ened the observation that TB influences PD independently. The
role of infection in PD is far from being confirmed. The
pathogenesis of PD is associated with loss of dopaminergic
neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the widespread presence of a-synuclein aggregates.15 Viruses, the
influenza virus in particular, can enter the substantia nigra and cause cell death directly.26,27 In addition, viral infections
may initiate a cytokine ``storm'' in the brain, with sequelae
including the activation of microglia and apoptosis of neurons.30,35 The brain is protected by the blood-brain barrier;
therefore, CNS infections are more likely to have neurological consequences than peripheral infections.29 However, increasing
evidence indicates that neuroinflammation may be caused by non-CNS infections.36-38 The association between H. pylori
and PD highlights that gastrointestinal tract represents a vulner-
able area through which pathogens can induce CNS neuroinflammation.31,32,39 TB, a common chronic infection of the lung known to induce proinflammatory responses,3 may also play a
key role in the pathogenesis of PD.
In addition to neuroinflammation, there may be other
mechanisms that explain this observation. The parkin protein,
an ubiquitin ligase in the innate defense mechanism, plays a key
role in ubiquitin-mediated autophagy against invading M. tuberculosis.40 PARK2 mutations in humans are well-known
risk factors for PD, and some polymorphisms in the regulatory
region of PARK2 result in reduced expression of the parkin protein.41 Therefore, mutations in PARK2, which imply an
impaired innate defense mechanism against M. tuberculosis,
may lead to increased susceptibility to PD.
We observed that the risk of PD decreased with the follow-
up period in the TB cohort (Table 5). A similar correlation has
never been found between infections and PD in previous
studies. Two possible explanations are proposed for this obser-
vation. First, the national guidelines for TB diagnosis and

treatment have been developed by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the past decade.42 Taiwan has also implemented the World Health Organization recommended strategy of the Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course program.42 Under these policies, the treatment success rate among new smear-positive cases reported in 2009 after 12 months of follow-up was 87%.34 The reduction in the risk of PD with the follow-up period in our study may indicate that the successful treatment of TB not only cures TB but also subsequently reduces the risk of PD.
Second, first-line medications for TB include rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.43 Among these medications, rifampicin has a cytoprotective role under a variety of
6 | www.md-journal.com

experimental, non-TB conditions.44 It suppresses the formation of a-synuclein aggregates, alleviates mitochondrial oxidative stress, and reduces microglial activation, thereby improving neuron survival under inflammatory conditions.44 Although additional research is required, rifampicin may be used not only to treat M. tuberculosis but also to prevent development of PD for subjects with active TB.
This study has several limitations. First, the NHIRD lacks information on patient behaviors and crucial PD risk factors, such as smoking, obesity or BMI, alcoholism, exercise, occupation, and dietary habits. Second, several relevant clinical variables, such as laboratory data, imaging results, and culture reports, were unavailable in our study; therefore, we could not

assess the severity of TB and chronic inflammation in patients. Third, the diagnosis of PD was based on clinical presentation, because neuroimaging findings are not available in the NHIRD. Finally, the evidence obtained from a retrospective cohort study generally has lower statistical quality than that obtained from randomized trials, because of potential biases related to adjustment for confounding variables. Bias resulting from unknown confounders might have affected the results despite our meticulous study design and control for confounding factors.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that patients with TB exhibited a 1.38-fold higher risk of PD compared with the general population by using a nationwide, population-based database containing a high number of TB cases. The risk of PD decreased with the follow-up period in the TB cohort. Physicians should be aware of the risk of PD in patients with TB and should provide adequate treatment to such patients to prevent PD development.

Prognostic and clinicopathological significance of long non-coding RNA UCA1 in colorectal cancer
Results from a meta-analysis
Xiaoqun Liu, MDa, Xiangdong Liu, MDb, Tiankui Qiao, MDa,, Wei Chen, MDa

Abstract Objective: Urothelial cancer-associated 1 (UCA1), an oncogenic long non-coding RNA, was aberrantly upregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to further explore the clinical value of UCA1 in CRC.
Methods: Eligible studies were retrieved by searching Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied to assess the prognostic role and clinical significance of UCA1.
Results: A total of 7 eligible studies with 775 cancer patients were recruited in the meta-analysis. The results showed that UCA1 overexpression was significantly correlated with poor overall survival in patients with CRC (HR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.77-2.87, P < .001). There was also a significantly negative association between high UCA1 levels and tumor differentiation (OR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.87- 4.31, P < .001), lymph node metastasis (OR = 3.48, 95% CI: 2.24-5.41, P < .001), distant metastasis (OR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.32-5.38, P = .006), tumor node metastasis stage (OR = 3.01, 95% CI: 2.16-4.18, P < .001), tumor invasion depth (OR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.03- 4.61, P = .04), and tumor size (OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.56-3.32, P < .001).
Conclusions: Our study revealed that UCA1 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis and more advanced clinicopathological features, suggesting that UCA1 may serve as an indicator for unfavorable outcome of patients with CRC.

1. Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is not only the fourth most frequent malignancy but also ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, which has threatened human health seriously. According to the GLOBOCAN 2018 database, approximately 1.8 million new cases and 861,600 deaths were caused by CRC in 2018.[1] Although great advances on

therapy strategies have been achieved, the clinical outcome of CRC still is far away from satisfaction.[2] Therefore, there is an
urgent need to understand the precise molecular mechanisms
underlying tumorigenesis as well as to identify new therapeutic
targets for CRC. Nowadays, advantage of molecular biomark-
ers in diagnosis and prognosis of multiple malignancies
has been highlighted, which might provide more exact clues
for supervising individual therapy and monitoring disease progression.[3,4]
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), accounting for 70% of the human genome, are defined as a class of RNA molecules with length larger than 200 nucleotides.[5] In the past, lncRNAs were
once considered as transcriptional noise in the genomic RNAs.
However, a growing body of evidence has suggested the regulation
role of lncRNAs on gene expression at the epigenetic, transcriptional, or posttranscriptional levels.[6,7] In particular, the effect of
lncRNAs on tumorigenesis has attracted attention recently and become widely acceptable.[8] More importantly, the expression of
lncRNAs was indicated to be dysregulated in multiple malignan-
cies, which is responsible for diverse biological processes, such as tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis.[9,10]
Subsequently, emerging evidence has suggested that there was a significant association between aberrant expression of lncRNAs and progression of disease, including clinicopathological features
and survival, which indicates that lncRNAs may serve as molecular biomarkers for various malignancies.[11]

discovered to be up-regulated in bladder transitional cell carcinoma in 2006 and could promote cell proliferation and transformation.[12,13] Recently, overexpressed UCA1 has attracted great concerns due to its involvement in diverse malignancies, especially CRC.[14,15] However, these results were limited by small sample scales or inconsistent conclusions. For instance, Han et al[14] demonstrated that UCA1 expression was related with differentiated histology and invasion depth of CRC, whereas Jiang et al[15] illustrated that UCA1 was correlated with differentiation rather than invasion depth. Until now, metaanalysis associated UCA1 has not yet to be performed in CRC. Therefore, with the aim to investigate the potentially clinical value of UCA1, relevant articles were collected to perform this comprehensive meta-analysis for assessing the correlation of UCA1 expression with clinicopathological features and prognosis in patients with CRC.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Literature search strategy
To get access to potentially eligible studies, relevant literatures exploring the association of UCA1 with clinicopathological features and prognosis of CRC were systematically retrieved in Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases updated to January 2019. To increase the sensitivity of the search, both MeSH terms and free-text words were used in the retrieval strategy. Relevant retrieval terms are as follows: "UCA1" or "urothelial cancer-associated 1", "cancer" or "carcinoma" or "tumor" or "neoplasm", and "survival" or "prognosis" or "prognostic" or "progression" or "metastasis" or "clinicopathological". In addition, the reference lists in relevant articles were screened manually in case of the omission of any potentially relevant literature. Because the data were obtained from publicly available databases, additional approval by an ethics committee was not applicable.
2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were formulated to screen the publications. The eligible studies met the following inclusion criteria:
(1) the association of UCA1 with progression of CRC was explored,
(2) the expression of UCA1 in primary cancerous tissues were detected,
(3) patients were grouped according to the expression levels of UCA1, and
(4) relevant clinicopathological parameters were described.
Exclusion criteria included
(1) duplicate publications, (2) no original articles, reviews, letters, case reports, and
commentaries, (3) studies focusing on UCA1 in other types of cancers rather
than CRC, (4) studies using non-tissue samples, and (5) studies lack of usable data.
For multiple publications from the same medical center, only the most recent or the most complete study was included in the meta-analysis.

2.3. Data extraction
According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, two investigators (X-QL and X-DL) deliberatively reviewed and collected the essential information from the eligible studies independently, For any discrepancy, a consensus was achieved through discussion with a third investigator (T-KQ). For each eligible study, the following information was collected: the first author' name, publication year, country, cancer type, sample size, detection method of UCA1 expression, cut-off value, number of patients in high/low UCA1 expression group, follow-up period, outcome measures, survival analysis methods (univariate or multivariate), and hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for overall survival (OS). If the HRs with their 95% CIs were provided in the original studies, these available data were extracted directly. When an included study gave only Kaplan-Meier survival curves, the survival data was digitized by the Engauge Digitizer version 4.1 software (http://digitizer.sourceforge.net/) and calculated as described by Tierney et al.[16]
2.4. Quality assessment
The quality of all included studies was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) criteria for cohort studies.[17] The NOS criteria is scored based on three aspects, including subject selection, comparability of subject, and clinical outcome, with the final scores ranging from 0 (lowest) to 9 (highest). A study with the NOS scores more than 6 was regarded as high quality.
2.5. Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.2 (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) and stata SE12.0 (Stata Corporation, TX). HRs and corresponding 95% CIs were used to assess the association between UCA1 and OS in CRC, with HR > 1 indicating that the patients with high UCA1 expression had a poor prognosis. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs were used to evaluate the association between UCA1 and clinicopathological features in patients of CRC. The between-studies heterogeneity was assessed with the Chi square-based Q test and I2 statistics. A P value < .05 or I2 > 50% indicated significant heterogeneity, in which case a random-effect model was applied, otherwise, a fixed-effect model was used. Subgroup analysis was performed to further investigate the prognostic value of UCA1 in CRC. Sensitivity analyses were employed to access the stability of the results. The potential publication bias was evaluated with funnelplot analysis as well as Egger's test. All the P values were determined by two-sided tests, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Literature information
As shown in the flow diagram (Fig. 1), a total of 235 records were retrieved by searching Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang databases. Initially, 5 records were removed because of duplication. After the title and abstract were screened, 132 articles were excluded due to either no original articles or reviews or case reports or commentaries. Subsequently, full text was assessed carefully and 91 articles were found to be ineligible due to lack of available outcome or inappropriate study design or for focusing on the level of UCA1 from other type of cancers rather than CRC. Finally, 7

studies[14,15,18-22] comprising 775 patients were identified as eligible for the present quantitative analysis, including 6 on OS and 7 on clinicopathological features.
3.2. Study characteristics
The main characteristics and data of the inclusion studies were summarized in Table 1. As shown, all studies were conducted in China and published between 2014 and 2018 with sample scales ranging from 54 to 185. Tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging ranged from stage I to IV. The longest follow-up period was up to 120 months. The UCA1 expression was detected with quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in all studies. The cut-off value of UCA1 levels was based on median value in 4 studies, mean value in 2 studies, and fourth quartile value in 1 study. With inconsistent cut-off value due to different criteria, all participants in the inclusion studies were categorized into high and low UCA1 expression groups. HRs with corresponding 95% CIs were extracted from multivariate analysis in 5 studies and univariate analysis in 5 studies (estimated effects collected from Kaplan-Meier survival curve in 2 studies). All of the included studies got 7 scores or more according to the NOS criteria, which indicated their high quality of methodology.

3.3. Association between UCA1 and OS
A total of 6 studies of 715 patients reported the association between UCA1 expression levels in cancer tissues and OS of CRC. As shown in Figure 2, the fixed-effect model was applied to calculate the pooled HR and its 95% CI since no significant heterogeneity was found among these studies (I2 = 0%, P = .44). The results revealed that high UCA1 expression was significantly associated with poor OS (HR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.77-2.87, P < .001). Although there was no significant between-studies heterogeneity, the subgroup meta-analysis was conducted based on analysis type, sample size, and cut-off value for a subsequent investigation of potential heterogeneity. From the subgroup results by analysis type (Fig. 3A), we found that UCA1 similarly was a significantly prognostic indicator of OS in multivariable analysis subgroup (HR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.80-3.16, P < .001) and univariable analysis subgroup (HR = 2.65, 95% CI: 1.93-3.63, P < .001), without statistically significant heterogeneity in the two subgroups (I2 = 8.0%, P = .36 and I2 = 25%, P = .25, respectively). Then, elevated UCA1 was also found to be significantly associated with OS of patients in studies with sample sizes both equal or greater than 90 (HR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.62-2.91, P < .001) and less than 90 (HR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.59- 3.74, P < .001), with significant heterogeneity in the former (I2 = 59%, P = .09) but not in the latter (I2 = 0%, P = .87) (Fig. 3B).

Meanwhile, a significant relationship between UCA1 expression and OS of patients was observed in studies with median as cut-off value (HR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.73-2.93, P < .001) and non-median as cut-off value (HR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.26-4.02, P = .006), without evidence of significant heterogeneity across the two subgroups (I2 = 27%, P = .24 and I2 = 0%, P = .53, respectively) (Fig. 3C). Results from the above analysis indicated that high UCA1 expression was significantly correlated with poor OS in CRC patients, suggesting that UCA1 was an indicator of decreased survival rate in CRC.
3.4. Association between UCA1 and clinicopathological
features
In order to determine whether the expression of UCA1 was related to clinically pathological characteristics, the clinicopathological data were further collected for the meta-analysis. As shown in Table 2, a total of 7 studies including 670 cases reported the association of UCA1 overexpression with clinicopathological features of CRC. Except for tumor invasion depth (I2 = 72%, P = .007), there was no significant heterogeneity among studies for age (I2 = 49%, P = .12), gender (I2 = 2%, P = .41), location (I2 = 0.0%, P = .80), tumor size (I2 = 47%, P = .11), lymph node metastasis (I2 = 0.0%, P = 1.0), distant metastasis (I2 = 25%, P = .26), TNM stage (I2 = 36%, P = .16), histopathological grade

(I2 = 26%, P = .23), lymphatic invasion (I2 = 0.0%, P = .73), and venous invasion (I2 = 0.0%, P = .78). The pooled results revealed that high UCA1 transcription levels were significantly associated with tumor differentiation (OR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.87-4.31, P < .001), lymph node metastasis (OR = 3.48, 95% CI: 2.24- 5.41, P < .001), distant metastasis (OR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.32- 5.38, P = .006), TNM stage (OR = 3.01, 95% CI: 2.16-4.18, P < .001), tumor invasion depth (OR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.03-4.61, P = 0.04), and tumor size (OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.56-3.32, P < .001). However, no significant correlation was found with gender (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.58-1.13, P = .21), age (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.61-1.37, P = .66), lymphatic invasion (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 0.88-2.75, P = .13), venous invasion (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.39-1.85, P = .69), and nervous invasion (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.18-1.95, P = .39). Taken together, the above results revealed that UCA1 overexpression was significantly correlated with poorer differentiation, deeper tumor invasion (T3 stage or more), higher risk of metastasis, and more advanced TNM stage in CRC patients, suggesting that UCA1 may serve as a risk factor for these unfavorably clinicopathologocal features of CRC.
3.5. Sensitivity analysis
In order to assess the stability of the pooled results, sensitivity analysis was performed using stata SE12.0 software to assess the

of studies and without between-studies heterogeneity, the sensitivity analysis was not performed in these groups of clinicopathologic covariates including age, location, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, and nervous invasion.

3.6. Publication bias
The funnel plots were employed to assess the potential publication bias of the present meta-analysis. As shown, no publication bias was found in the studies with OS (Fig. 5A) or gender (Fig. 5B) or depth of tumor (Fig. 5C) or tumor differentiation (Fig. 5D) or TNM stage (Fig. 5E) or tumor size (Fig. 5F), which was confirmed in Egger's linear regression test using stata SE12.0 software (Table 3). Because of the small number of studies and little heterogeneity, the publication bias was not analyzed in the remaining clinicopathologic co-variate groups.

4. Discussion
Nowadays, CRC constitutes a major part of human cancers and still remains an important health challenge worldwide, especially in China.[1] Typically, due to lacking specific symptoms in the early stage of CRC, most patients are diagnosed in an advanced stage, which is responsible for an undesirable five-year survival rate.[23] Thus, it is urgent to identify more precise and specific biomarkers for improving diagnosis and evaluating prognosis.
Accumulating evidence demonstrated that the initiation and progression of malignant tumors was a multi-step process involving in aberrant expression of lncRNAs of multiple

oncogenes and anti-oncogenes.[24,6] As one of oncogenic lncRNAs, UCA1 was showed extensive regulatory functions in diverse biological processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and cell cycle progression in various types of

cancer.[25,26] In addition, UCA1 can also act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging to miR-204-5p and regulate the expression of miR-204-5p target genes, such as CREB1 and ZEB1, which is associated with migration and

invasion.[27] Recently, a growing number of studies have uncovered that UCA1 expression was markedly upregulated in CRC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues.[25,28] Furthermore, upregulated UCA1 has been found to play important roles in CRC occurrence and progression via exerting oncogenic function.[29,30] Meanwhile, it was also reported that a high level of UCA1 expression was closely correlated with a larger tumor size, poorer differentiated histology, and greater tumor depth.[14,18,21] More importantly, patients with high UCA1 expression had a poorer prognosis compared to patients with low UCA1 expression.[14,15,18,20-22]
The above-mentioned results suggested that UCA1 played a crucial regulatory role in the biological process of carcinogenesis and might serve as a potential target for treatment of CRC. However, the sample sizes in most studies were relatively small. Even, it was distinctive about the association between UCA1 overexpression and progression of CRC, such as invasion and metastasis. With the intent to identify the clinical value of UCA1 expression, a comprehensive meta-analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between UCA1 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics and assess prognosis role of UCA1 for CRC patients.
To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to explore the clinical significance and prognostic value of UCA1 overexpression in CRC. Here, this meta-analysis on 7 eligible studies with a total of 775 patients was evaluated to provide evidences that UCA1 overexpression could predict advanced clinicopathological features and serve as an unfavorably risk factor for survival of patients with CRC. In these findings, the elevated UCA1 expression was negatively correlated with poor OS in patients with CRC. Meanwhile, subgroup analysis was performed and the pooled results would not be altered by other factors, such as sample size, analysis type, and cut-off value. In addition, the association between UCA1 expression and clinicopathological features was evaluated in patients with CRC. Totally, the results verified that high UCA1 expression was associated with worse histopathological grade, deeper tumor invasion, and more advanced TNM stage. Furthermore, the patients with UCA1 overexpression may have a higher risk of developing lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. Besides, the sensitivity analysis also indicated the stability of this results.
Otherwise, it should be emphasized that several limitations existed in the current meta-analysis. First, all available studies were performed in Chinese population rather than worldwide population, suggesting that the clinical role of UCA1 should be taken cautiously in other regions and ethnicities. Second, the data of HR and 95% CIs estimated from Kaplan-Meier survival curves might be less accurate than that obtained directly from published statistical data, which might increase the potential bias. Third, the limited databases were used for retrieval and the included studies were of relatively small numbers as well as an inconsistent cut-off value of UCA1 expression, which might result in some heterogeneity. In addition, the power of the study was not defined and the statistical analysis measuring that the sample size is adequate enough to make any conclusions was not performed in our present study. Based on these limitations, the predictive significance of assessed UCA1 in these unfavorably clinicopathological covariates and poor prognosis of CRC patients might be overestimated to some extent.
Taken together, the present study revealed that UCA1 overexpression not only might predict a poor prognosis in CRC but also was associated with advanced tumor stage and high

risks of metastasis, especially in Chinese population. In another word, UCA1 may serve as a promising biomarker to predict prognosis and progression of CRC. Considering the limitations existing in the present study, more large-scale and better designed studies should be required to conduct for further updating the findings of this analysis.

Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) has been the leading cause of poisoning mortality in many countries and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is a widely accepted treatment for CO poisoning. However, some patients with CO poisoning will still develop neurocognitive sequelae regardless of HBO therapy, which can persist since CO poisoning or be present days to weeks after a recovery from CO poisoning. HBO has been used in the prevention and treatment of neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning, and some mechanisms are also proposed for the potential neuroprotective effects of HBO on the neurocognitive impairment after CO poisoning, but there is still controversy on the effectiveness of HBO on neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning. In this paper, we briefly introduce the neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning, summarize the potential predictive factors of neurocognitive sequelae, and discuss the use of HBO in the treatment and prevention of neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning.

INTRODUCTION
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless, and tasteless gas, and thus it is highly difficult to detect when escaping. CO at a concentration higher than 35 ppm is toxic to humans. CO is the leading cause of poisoning mortality in many countries and may be responsible for more than half of all fatal poisonings worldwide.1 Although patients can improve over many months, and even up to 1 year, at 6 years after CO poisoning, survivors of CO poisoning usually suffer from long term neurocognitive sequelae related to brain injury.2,3 The neurological or cognitive sequelae can occur immediately and persist over time, or the onset can be delayed, and the persistent neurological sequelae (PNS) and delayed neurological sequelae (DNS) are common following acute CO poisoning. It seems that DNS patients have more severe symptoms and worse clinical outcomes than the PNS patients,4 and the DNS patients had more significant progress on general cognitive function, psychomotor speed, and visual-spatial ability than did the acute group after continuous hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy.5 The symptoms of DNS typically develop after an interval of 2-40 days.6 The symptoms of neurocognitive sequelae related to brain injury after CO poisoning include impaired memory, cognitive dysfunction, depression, anxiety, and/or vestibular and motor deficits, and these deficits are evident by 6 weeks.3 Mimura et al.7 reported 68.6% of patients had intellectual disturbances and 48.7% had neurologic symptoms at 33 years after CO poisoning, which seems to illustrate the irreversible nature of these deficits. In a study involving 25,912 patients

with CO poisoning, Huang et al.8 found the prevalence rate of neurological sequelae after CO poisoning was 9.1% in total, and the rate was 2.3% in the first 2 weeks and 6.2% at the end of the first year. In a more recent study, Huang et al.9 found he incidence rates of degenerative diseases of the central nervous system, psychiatric diseases, and other diseases of the nervous system were 23.2, 87.8, and 57.6 per 1000 person-years in patients receiving HBO therapy and 14.9, 59.3, and 34.9 per 1000 person-years in patients without HBO therapy, respectively. In addition, there is evidence showing that the incidences of cognitive deficits and neurologic deficits are 19% and 37% after CO poisoning, respectively.10 The reported incidence of DNS varies from 0.06% to 40% with the onset 2 to 40 days after CO poisoning,11,12 but the information regarding the prevalence of PNS is limited. In a prospective study, Weaver et al.13 reported 37% of the participants (n = 238) had cognitive sequelae at 6 weeks, of which 59% had PNS and 28% had DNS, a ratio of 2:1 (PNS: initial cognitive dysfunction persists to 6 weeks after CO poisoning; DNS: a decline of at least 1 standard deviation on a neuropsychological subtest score from a prior score). In the current review, we briefly summarized the predictive factors, mechanisms and HBO treatment of neurocognitive sequelae following CO poisoning by searching the PubMed.
PREDICTIVE FACTORS
Some studies have been conducted to investigate the factors predicting the neurocognitive sequelae following CO poisoning. The available factors can be classified as the demograph-

ics, clinical characteristics, blood biochemical parameters, imaging findings and treatments.
Age and sex are two important factors affecting the outcomes of acute CO poisoning. There is evidence showing that old age, male sex and comorbidities were found to be independent predictors for neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning.9 However, the age and sex as predictors of neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning is controversial. The study of Pepe et al.14 revealed the DNS had no relationship with age and sex.
The clinical characteristics (especially symptoms and signs) may reflect the severity of CO poisoning, and thus it is reasonable that they can be employed for the prediction of neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning. Studies have indicated that a longer duration of admission, CO exposure duration > 6 hours, systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, Glasgow Coma Scale score < 9, Mini-Mental State Examination score, a lack of pupil reflex and a positive Babinski reflex were associated with the development of DNS or neurological sequelae,14-17 but voluntary exposure, headache and transient loss of consciousness failed to predict neurocognitive sequelae.14 Of note, a loss of consciousness was found to be related to the development of neurological sequelae in other studies.16,18
A variety of studies have investigated the blood parameters as the predictors of neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning. Available studies have indicated plasma copeptin,19 serum S-100B protein,20-22 neuron-specific enolase,23 serum lactate level,22,24 serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide,25 troponin, creatine kinase,18,26 creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase,26 serum anion gap,22 serum ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1,27 and creatine phosphokinase and leukocytosis14 are related to the neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning, and this risk increases with the number of independent predictors.16 In addition, neuron-specific enolase could improve the prediction accuracy of initial Glasgow Coma Scale.23 It has been hypothesized that CO poisoning maybe also causes the formation of myelin basic protein (MBP) and DNS occurs due to extensive myelin and neuronal loss.28 Study also shows cerebrospinal fluid-MBP can serve as a sensitive predictor of both the development and outcomes of DNS.29 As mentioned above, serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, troponin, creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB are possible prognostic factors for the development of neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning, and all these parameters are related to myocardial injury. This is supported by more recent findings that patients having myocardial injury had elevated risk for both PNS and DNS30 and QTc prolongation within 6 hours after CO exposure was a predictor of DNS31 However, the application of these parameters in clinical practice warrants more clinical studies, and there is still controversy on several blood parameters (such as lactate level14). Thom et al.32 used Luminex-based technology to determine the concentration of 180 proteins in 63 suspected CO poisoning patients, and they concluded that the CO pathophysiology was complex and this technique had insufficient power to identify reliable plasma predictors of neurological sequelae although their findings support a view that CO exposure caused acute inflammatory events in humans. Of note, some studies fail to found the relationship between carboxyhemoglobin and neurocognitive

sequelae after CO poisoning although carboxyhemoglobin is a common blood parameter that is detected on admission and used to diagnose CO poisoning and assess the severity of CO poisoning.14,15
Several studies have also investigated the relationships of treatments after CO poisoning with neurocognitive sequelae. In the study of Lin et al.,30 use of tranquilizer and treatment in intensive care unit increased the risk for PNS. Chang et al.33 found treatment in the intensive care unit because of prolonged loss of consciousness was the independent risk factor for DNS and rescue by a ventilator was independently associated with PNS. The intubation requirement was also found to be a possible prognostic factor for development of DNS after CO poisoning.18 A treatment for CO poisoning is HBO therapy, studies also assess the relationship between HBO therapy and neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning, but there is still controversy on this issue. Chang et al.33 found HBO therapy did not affect the incidence of both DNS and PNS. In addition, there is evidence showing that more sessions of HBO therapy was associated with the development of DNS15 and HBO therapy seemed to increase the risk for neurocognitive sequelae.9 However, in a study with small sample size, Chan et al.18 found a 100% protective effect of HBO therapy against development of DNS in patients with severe CO poisoning (24 patients receiving HBO therapy did not develop DNS).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are the common tools used in the assessment of brain injury.34-36 It has been confirmed that CO poisoning may result in focal and generalized neuroanatomical abnormalities observed on MRI and CT. Imaging examinations can not only be used for the assessment of early neurological lesions after CO poisoning, but also be employed to aid the diagnosis of neurocognitive sequelae. The imaging findings of the brain after CO poisoning and those in patients with neurocognitive sequelae have been described elsewhere.37,38 Here, we only discuss the predictive value of imaging findings of the brain. Several studies have shown that the presence of acute brain lesions on MRI was significantly associated with the development of DNS39,40 and fractional anisotropy value of white matter on diffusion tensor imaging is also predictive for DNS.41,42 Head CT findings indicating hypoxic encephalopathy and regional cerebral blood flow are also predictive for the development of DNS.26,43 Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy can monitor the neurochemical disturbances to assess the pathophysiology of CO poisoning. It was reported that the presence of a lactate peak was a predictor for a poor long-term outcome, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy within 1 week after CO poisoning could be employed to predict DNS development.44 The striatal dopamine transporter binding measured by single photon emission CT with 99mTcTRODAT could help to predict the development of DNS.45 However, Ozcan et al.46 found the white matter lesions which progress to demyelination and end up in neuropsychological sequelae could not always be diagnosed by early CT and MRI in CO poisoning.
Several investigators also investigate the predictive value of polymorphism for neurocognitive sequelae in patients after CO poising. Liang et al.47 investigated the PARK2 polymorphism

and clinical outcome in patients following CO poisoning and found the allelic variant of rs1784594 was a risk factor for DNS. In the study of Li et al.,48 results showed variants at NRXN3 was associated with DNS after acute CO poisoning. Hopkins et al.3 investigated the APOE genotypes in 86 of 152 CO-poisoned patients and their results showed HBO therapy reduces cognitive sequelae after CO poisoning in the absence of the epsilon4 allele.
MECHANISMS
The pathogenesis of neurocognitive sequelae is still poorly understood, and several mechanisms have been proposed: (1) hypoxia: It is well known that the affinity of CO to hemoglobin is 300 times higher than that of oxygen, and the release of CO from carboxyhemoglobin is 3600 times slower than that of oxygen, which may cause hypoxia following CO poisoning, which was proposed as a factor related to neurocognitive sequelae.10 The termination of CO exposure or treatment for CO poisoning seems to be an oxygenation, which mimics the ischemia/reperfusion injury to the brain.10 In addition, CO may also bind to the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase to inhibit mitochondrial respiration, which reduces ATP production, directly or indirectly causing damage to cells; the extended and generalized inhibition of cytochrome oxidase could explain the persistence of different symptoms after the normalization of carboxyhemoglobin levels.49 Although CO induced hypoxia plays a role in the pathogenesis of CO poisoning, its contribution is likely much less than previously suspected since many of the second order effects described are not completely explained by hypoxemic hypoxia.50 (2) Immune-mediated injury: CO poisoning may also causes adduct formation between MBP and malonylaldehyde, resulting in an immunological cascade.28 Cerebrospinal fluid-MBP can serve as a sensitive predictor of both the development and outcomes of DNS.29 (3) Metabolic dysfunction: CO poisoning may cause metabolic dysfunction in the brain, affecting the neurological dysfunction.44,51 (4) Cytotoxicity of neurotransmitter: it has been found that glutamate increases significantly after CO poisoning and glutamate activates N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, enhancing cellular dysfunction and apoptosis.52,53 (5) Reactive oxygen species: CO poisoning may significantly increase the reactive oxygen species production in the brain and weaken antioxidant systems,54 and lipid peroxidation was found to be involved in the memory impairment of CO-induced delayed neuron damage.55 In addition, anti-oxidative strategies have also employed for the treatment of acute CO poisoning56 and its neurocognitive sequelae,57 and Mannaioni et al.58 proposed the addition of free radical scavengers (such as glutathione, acetylcysteine, and tempol) to the standardized treatment of acute CO poisoning. (6) Cell death: CO poisoning may cause cell death via different ways (apoptosis and autophagy), predisposing brain injury.58-61 (7) Others: CO may also induce neuronal ion channel dysfunction62 and inflammation,63,64 which also contribute to the pathogenesis of neurocognitive sequelae. In addition, the nicotinic cholinergic system is also related to DNS.65
EFFECTS OF HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY
HBO therapy refers to an intervention in which an individual
32

breathes near 100% oxygen while inside a hyperbaric chamber that is pressurized to greater than sea level pressure (1 atmosphere absolute [ATA]). Although CO poisoning is an indication to HBO therapy and there is evidence showing HBO therapy is associated with lower mortality,66,67 the effects of HBO therapy on the development of neurocognitive sequelae remain controversial.9,13 In the following section, we summarized the use of HBO in the therapy and the prevention of neurocognitive sequelae.
HBO treatment In as early as 1985, Myers and colleagues68 reported 12.1% neurological sequelae in a series of 82 patients treated with normobaric oxygen. Ten patients returned with headaches, irritability, personality changes, confusion, and loss of memory. These recurring symptoms resolved rapidly with HBO therapy. They recommend that HBO be used whenever CO symptoms recur.68 Thereafter, increasing institutes employ HBO for the treatment of neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning, and some case reports, clinical studies and animal studies published confirm the neuroprotective effects of HBO on them.69-71 Chang et al.72 conducted HBO therapy in a series of patients with DNS and found 8-40 sessions of HBO therapy was able to decrease the severity of impairment in DNS patients. After reviewing literature, Lee et al.73 concluded that HBO may be effective in treating DNS after CO poisoning. Spagnolo et al.74 even reported the delayed HBO therapy improved the DNS in a 62-year-old man suffering from CO poisoning who did not receive HBO therapy at baseline. Another advantage of HBO therapy is that it is relatively safe for pregnant women75 and children,76 and it can also be used during mechanical ventilation.77
Of note, there is limited evidence of the efficacy of HBO treatment, and supportive and symptomatic treatment is recommended for patients diagnosed with neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning.78 Some investigators attempt to use HBO therapy in combination with other strategies in the treatment of neurocognitive sequelae after CO exposure. There is evidence showing that N-butylphthalide is protective on CO poisoning in animals79 and Xiang et al.80 found combined application of N-butylphthalide and HBO could significantly improve the cognitive dysfunction of patients with DNS and have great clinical efficacy. In addition, HBO therapy combined with risperidone,81 acupuncture,82 high dose ganglioside,83 edaravone,84 dexamethasone85 and hypothermia86 is also found to improve the neuropsychological functions of patients after CO poisoning.
Prevention with HBO As above mentioned, several factors are closely related to the development of neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning, in which HBO therapy is an important one. Based on the findings from a clinical study, Thom et al.6 recommended HBO treatment in acute CO poisoning to decrease the incidence of DNS after CO poisoning. They further investigated the potential mechanism and found the prophylactic effect of HBO therapy on DNS was related to the inhibition of MBP induced lymphocyte activation after CO poisoning.87 Early

HBO therapy is employed to prevent the development of neurocognitive sequelae. Weaver et al.13 proposed emergent HBO therapy within 24 hours appeared to reduce the risk of cognitive sequelae after acute CO poisoning. For children with CO poisoning, HBO therapy affected the neuropsychological symptoms88 and Gozubuyuk et al.76 proposed HBO therapy should be performed within first 6 hours of poisoning if possible, and HBO therapy should be repeated within 6 to 8 hours if loss of consciousness persists after HBO therapy, which may improve the prognosis. After literature reviewing, Lee et al.73 also concluded immediate administration of HBO during acute CO intoxication may prevent neuropsychiatric sequelae. Although the effects of HBO vs normobaric oxygen therapy on long-term neurocognitive outcomes after CO poisoning remain unclear, the 2017 American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Clinical Policy on CO Poisoning provides level B recommendations that HBO or high-flow normobaric oxygen therapy should be used for acute CO-poisoned patients.89 In addition, some investigators also investigate the role of oxygen partial pressure in the therapeutic effects of oxygen. In an in vitro study, Juric et al.90 compared the effectiveness of normobaric oxygen vs. HBO in the treatment of CO poisoning, and their results showed oxygen therapy (1 hour) disclosed pressure- and time-dependent efficacy in restoring astrocytic mitochondrial function and the prevention of apoptosis. In the study of Thom et al.,6 7 of 30 patients (23%) developed DNS after treatment with ambient-pressure oxygen (DNS occurred 6 ± 1 days after poisoning), but none developed sequelae in 30 patients after HBO treatment. Lin et al.91 conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of normobaric and HBO on neuropsychometric dysfunction after CO poisoning. They conclude that patients receiving HBO treatment had a lower incidence of neuropsychological sequelae (including headache, memory impairment, difficulty concentrating, disturbed sleep, and DNS) as compared to those treated with normobraic oxygen. Hampson et al compared two hyperbaric treatment protocols for CO poisoning (2.4 ATA, 100% oxygen, 90 minutes vs. US Air Force CO protocol [3.0 ATA maximum pressure])92 and results showed there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with abnormal neurological testing at 14-21 days (4/18 vs. 2/12; P = 0.71). In addition, the effect on headache after CO poisoning was also similar between HBO therapy and normobaric oxygen therapy.93
However, there is still controversy about the efficacy of HBO on development of neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning. In patients with initial impairment of consciousness after CO poisoning who received 4-hour normobaric oxygen treatment, HBO therapy seemed to have no influence on the development of neuropsychiatric sequelae.94 On the basis of six randomized controlled trials, Buckley et al.95 speculated that the efficacy of HBO for the prevention of neurological sequelae was still uncertain, which might be ascribed to the significant methodologic and statistical heterogeneity. Gilmer et al.96 also found HBO was not effective in preventing neurologic sequelae in mice and there was no benefit of HBO over normobaric oxygen following severe CO poisoning. Scheinkestel et
Medical Gas Research ¦ March ¦ Volume 10 ¦ Issue 1

al.97 also compared HBO with normobaric oxygen in patients with CO poisoning, and found more patients receiving HBO required additional treatments; more HBO treated patients had a worse outcome in the learning test and a greater number of abnormal test results at completion of treatment; DNS was restricted to HBO treated patients (P = 0.03), but no outcome measure was worse in normobaric oxygen group. Two randomized controlled trials also failed to show the evidence of superiority of HBO over normobaric oxygen in patients with transient loss of consciousness, and two HBO sessions were associated with worse outcomes than one HBO session in comatose patients.98 In a population-based cohort study involving 24,046 patients with CO poisoning, Huang et al.9 found the risk for neurologic sequelae was higher in patients with CO poisoning who received HBO therapy than in those who did not after adjusting for age, sex, and other confounding factors, and similar findings were observed after stratifying the patients by age, sex, underlying comorbidities, and monthly income. Moreover, they found the increased risk was most prominent in the first 2 weeks and remained significant up to 6 months later. In addition, the effectiveness of HBO therapy still remains unclear in preventing dementia.99
CONCLUSIONS
CO has been the leading cause of poisoning mortality in many countries. Although great progress has been achieved in the treatment of CO poisoning, some patients will still develop neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning, which can persist since CO poisoning or be present days to weeks after a recovery from CO poisoning. Administration of supplemental oxygen is the primary treatment for CO poisoning, but the delivery of supplemental oxygen via HBO remains inconclusive as a primary treatment strategy. Moreover, the effectiveness of HBO in the prevention and treatment of neurocognitive sequelae is still controversial. A recent study with large sample size brings promise to the use of HBO in the therapy of CO poisoning, but this study remains distant from the ideal of a large blinded multicenter randomized controlled trial. As shown by Cowl,100 "it is time to justify HBO delivery for CO poisoning."

Abstract
Background: Phyllanthus amarus is commonly used for treatment such as in gastro, urogenital diseases and infection. However, it is speculated to have some toxic effects such as renal tubular damage. Aims: This study was to investigate the histological effects of chronic administration of the herb on kidney of adult Wistar rats. Material and Methods: Rats of both sexes (n = 24), with average weight of 200g were randomly assigned into two treatments (A and B) and control (C) groups of 8 rats each. Rats in treatment groups (A) and (B) respectively received daily administration of 400mg and 800mg of aqueous Phyllanthus amarus, per 70kg body weight for 30days through the orogastric tube. The control group received distilled water through the same route. All rats were fed with grower's mash and given water liberally. The rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation on the thirty-first day of the experiment and the kidneys were carefully dissected out and quickly fixed in 10% formal saline for histological study. Results: The observations indicate that rats in the treated groups showed some varying degree of distortion and disruption in microanatomy of the kidney including interstitial oedema and tubular necrosis, when compared to the control section. Conclusion: This report provides further evidence that medicinal use of Phyllanthus amarus has a potential adverse effect. This warrants further studies to establish or rule out any untoward side-effect of chronic renal dysfunctions.
Keywords: Antioxidant toxicity, ethnomedicinal practice, histological effects, Phyllanthus amarus, renal dysfunction.

Introduction
Phyllanthus amarus (P. amarus) is an ethnobotanical plant that is distributed in almost all tropical countries and regions including America, India and Nigeria. It is a common weed, which grows well in moist, shady and sunny places. It is known by several other names such as carry-me-seed, chanca piedra, and quinine weed to mention a few (1).
P. amarus is believed to possess anti-diabetic, anti-nociceptive, antioxidant, antiseptic, antiviral, contraceptive, diuretic, hypotensive and stomachic properties. It is used accordidng in many countries (2-5). It is particularly used traditionally in the treatment of several other diseases including diabetes, diarrhea, dysentery,

fevers, jaundice, ulcers, urogenital diseases and wounds (1, 6-9).
Herbal medicines are widely perceived by the public as being natural, healthful and free from side effects. However, plants contain hundreds of constituents and some of them may elicit toxic side effects. Phytochemically, P. amarus contains alkaloids, antioxidants (including flavonoids, phenols and polyphenols) and lignans (1). All of these chemical components have their useful as well as toxic effects. Hence safety of herbal medicines is still an issue worldwide (10, 11).
The toxic effects of P. amarus has been suggested in literature (12, 13). However, histological perspectives are

yet to be elaborated. In humans, the majority of drugs administered are eliminated by a combination of hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. Given the suggestion of potential toxicity of P. amarus, the objective of this study is to examine the effects of chronic consumption of P. amarus on the microanatomy of kidney.

Results
The photomicrograph of the control kidney section show normal histological features. The section indicated a detailed cortical parenchyma and the renal corpuscles appeared as dense rounded structures (Fig.1).

Materials and Methods
Animals and ethical concerns Twenty-four adult Wistar rats of both sexes with average weight of 200g were equally and randomly assigned into two treatment groups [A] and [B]; and untreated Control group [C] of (n = 8) per group. The School of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Benin granted approval before the work began. The animal care and use ethics was in compliance to the Animal Holdings protocol overseen by the head of department through the Animal Holding unit. The rats were obtained and maintained in the Animal Holdings of the Department of Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Benin, Benin city, Edo State, Nigeria. The animals were fed with grower's mash obtained from Edo Feeds and Flour Mill Limited, Ewu, Edo State, Nigeria and given feeds liberally.
Preparation and administration of P. amarus The P. amarus leaves were obtained in Benin City. The leaves were cleaned, oven-dried at 50oC and macerated into dry powder. The powder was extracted with distilled water using Soxhlet apparatus and concentrated by rotary evaporator at 65OC. It was then transferred into a suitable container and freeze dried ready for the experiment. All preparations were performed at the Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin city, Edo State, Nigeria.

Fig. 1 Control section of the Kidney (H & E x100)
The kidney sections from the treated groups (A) and (B) revealed some varying degree of distortion and disruption in microanatomy of the renal cortex, including queried edema, when compared to the control group (Fig. 2). There is no remarkable difference in observed distortion between the treated groups A and B.

Treatment of animals Animals in group A were given the aqueous extract of Phyllanthus amarus at a single dose of 400mg/kg body weight daily for thirty days through the orogastric tube, while animals in group B received 800mg/kg body weight daily via the same route and the same period. Animals in group C received equal volume of distilled water, for the same period and through the same route of administration. The rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation on the thirty-one day of the experiment and the kidney was quickly dissected out and fixed in 10% formal saline for routine histological techniques.
Histological study The tissues were dehydrated in an ascending grade of alcohol (ethanol), cleared in xylene and embedded in paraffin wax. Serial sections of 7 microns thick were obtained using a rotatory microtome. The deparaffinized sections were stained routinely with haematoxyline and eosin (H & E). Photomicrographs of the results were obtained using research photographic microscope in the Department of Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Benin, Benin city, Edo State, Nigeria.

Discussion
This report presents the toxic effects of chronic administration of P. amarus on the microanatomy of the renal cortical structure. It has been speculated that toxic effects could be independent of concentration (14). In this study, we observed no remarkable effect with higher concentration. Further studies are necessary to establish the effects of different doses of P. amarus on different tissues and/or organs.
The histological effects observed in this experiment is in consonance with the report of Manjrekar et al. who observed that P. amarus induced deleterious changes on the renal tubules and testes of male rats (12, 13). It is also in consonance with the reported effects of damiana (Turnera diffusa) on matured Wistar rats where distortion

194

of the renal cortical structures, reduced number and size of

the renal corpuscles were observed (15).

7.

It is noteworthy that P. amarus contains alkaloids and lots

of antioxidants (1, 5), which has been given to apparently

healthy animals. Our observation is consistent with the

notion that antioxidant is associated with toxicities 8.

especially if taken arbitrarily (16). Although, antioxidants

are essential for alleviation of oxidative stress, indiscrete

intake of alkaloids and antioxidant constituents of P. 9.

amarus may present their toxic effects by inducing

oxidative stress (17, 18). Therefore, we suggest that the

distortion and disruption of the architecture of the kidney

observed in this experiment could be a factor of its

antioxidant content. That is, a histological perspective of 10.

antioxidant toxicity on renal system. The implication is

that arbitrary chronic and/or excessive consumption of P.

amarus may be detrimental to the health status of animals.

11.

The importance of this report lies in the potential adverse

effects of P. amarus on the microanatomy of tissues and

organs. In the kidney, it has been indicated to cause 12.

necrosis and protein casts in the kidney tubules (12, 13).

The observation of distortion from this study provides

further evidence that medicinal use of P. amarus has

adverse side effects. It calls for caution and discretion as

with other medicines.

13.

Conclusion
The study shows histological evidence that chronic 14. administration of P. amarus has potential adverse effect on kidney. The hypothetical implication is that the function of the kidney may be adversely affected by P. amarus. It is 15. recommended that further studies be carried out to examine this hypothesis.

SUMMARY
KRAS is one of the driver oncogenes in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but remains refractory to current modalities of targeted pathway inhibition, which include inhibiting downstream kinase MEK to circumvent KRAS activation. Here, we show that pulsatile, rather than continuous, treatment with MEK inhibitors (MEKis) maintains T cell activation and enables their proliferation. Two MEKis, selumetinib and trametinib, induce T cell activation with increased CTLA-4 expression and, to a lesser extent, PD-1 expression on T cells in vivo after cyclical pulsatile MEKi treatment. In addition, the pulsatile dosing schedule alone shows superior anti­ tumor effects and delays the emergence of drug resistance. Furthermore, pulsatile MEKi treatment combined with CTLA-4 blockade prolongs survival in mice bearing tumors with mutant Kras. Our results set the foundation and show the importance of a combinatorial therapeutic strategy using pulsatile targeted therapy together with immunotherapy to optimally enhance tumor delay and promote long-term anti-tumor immunity.

KRAS mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains refractory to targeted therapeutics. Choi et al. show that pulsatile, rather than continuous, treatment with MEK inhibitors can maintain T cell activity better and prolong survival in mice with Kras mutant cancer. This effect is further enhanced when combined with CTLA-4 blockade.

INTRODUCTION
The RAS-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is hyper-activated in a variety of different cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Fernández-Medarde and Santos, 2011). Activating mutations of KRAS are common oncogenic drivers, responsible for 20%-30% of lung adenocarcinoma patients (Lovly and Carbone, 2011). However, currently, there are no approved targeted therapies specifically for NSCLC patients with a KRAS mutation. Targeted MEK inhibitors (MEKis), which act downstream of the RAS signaling pathway, are designed to block the hyperactive signaling cascade in KRAS mutant lung cancer patients (Ostrem et al., 2013; Zeng et al., 2017) and block the proliferation and survival program in cancer cells (Riely et al., 2009).
MEKis are in diverse phases of clinical development, including trametinib, which has been approved in combination with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib for the treatment of a subset of NSCLC with BRAFV600E mutation (Friday and Adjei, 2008; Greystoke et al., 2017; Planchard et al., 2017; Stinchcombe and Johnson, 2014). However, despite promising co-clinical studies in mouse models and clinical trials (Chen et al., 2012; Greystoke et al., 2017; Planchard et al., 2017), resistance to MEKis is often observed (Soria et al., 2017). This resistance has been attributed to the heterogeneity of the tumor (Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017; Swanton and Govindan, 2016) and to intrinsic and acquired resistance from both cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (Ebert et al., 2016; Manchado et al., 2016). Therefore, there is a need to further improve the efficacy of MEKis in KRAS-driven lung cancer. A theoretically promising therapeutic approach would entail simultaneously blocking KRAS signaling and activating tumor-infiltrating T cells, the latter being relevant given the recent demonstration of activity of immune checkpoint blockade of the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways in NSCLC and other malignancies (Borghaei et al., 2015; Brahmer et al., 2015; Garon et al., 2015; Reck et al., 2016; Wolchok et al., 2013). Despite the success of immune-based therapies, the need remains for better treatment strategies for the majority of patients with advanced NSCLC, since the response to current single-agent PD-1 pathway blockade is durable only in a subset of patients (Borghaei et al., 2015; Brahmer et al., 2015), and initial results in combination with CTLA-4 blockade showed promising efficacy for the treatment of NSCLC only in a subset of patients (Hellmann et al., 2017).
Based on the limitations of both immune-based therapies and targeted therapies, we sought to rationally combine these two modalities to treat KRAS mutant lung cancers. In addition to the essential role of MEKis in RAS-MEK-ERK signaling suppression during the tumorigenesis of NSCLC, the effect of MEKis on immune cells is complex and context dependent. The RAS-MEKERK signaling cascade is critical in the normal physiologic function of immune cells, especially T cells (Weiss and Littman, 1994). The sequential signaling of RAS-MEK-ERK after T cell receptor (TCR) activation is responsible for the

activity of NFAT and the production of interleukin (IL)-2, which are critical for T cell clonal expansion (Kane et al., 2000; Weiss and Littman, 1994). Previous studies have shown that inhibition of MEK signaling by small molecules reduces or regulates paradoxically the proliferation of T cells in vitro (Callahan et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015a). Nevertheless, it enhances the proliferation of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in CT26 Kras mutant colorectal cancer, resulting in the expansion of tumor-reactive T cell populations with cytotoxic activity (Ebert et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2015a). However, conventional continuous administration of MEKis achieves an inadequate inhibition of ERK activity, which induces feedback regulation of other proliferation and survival pathways and re-activates MEK-ERK signaling, leading to drug resistance (Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014; Sun et al., 2014). Moreover, prolonged blockade of TCR signaling by MEKis interferes with effector function and proliferation at the tumor site (Dushyanthen et al., 2017). The recent failure of a clinical trial with continuous MEKi (cobimetinib) and anti-PD-L1 (atozolizumab) combination treatment in colorectal cancer (phase III IMblaze370 study, NCT02788279) suggests that the scheduling of these drugs needs optimization.
Unconventional pulsatile treatment schedules using targeted drugs such as the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib showed better suppression of tumor growth in melanoma, breast cancer, and leukemia (Das Thakur et al., 2013; Shah et al., 2008; Solit et al., 2005). In support of this pulsatile treatment regimen in the case of MEKis, transient pretreatment or lead-in treatment with MEKis in combination with anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 showed better survival and lower tumor burden in the CT26 mouse tumor model (Poon et al., 2017). Despite these encouraging observations, the status of T cell activation using these unconventional regimens has not been explored systematically. We hypothesize that through an optimized MEKi dosing schedule, we can maximize the suppression of KRAS-induced proliferation and survival of cancer cells while minimizing the detrimental effects on immune cells.
In this study, we have investigated how a pulsatile dosing schedule of MEKis affects T cell activation in mutant KRAS-driven lung cancer models both ex vivo and in vivo. We observed that pulsatile treatment induced improved proliferation and activation of T cells with higher expression levels of immune checkpoint regulators, including CTLA-4 and PD-1, when compared with the conventional continuous treatment with the same drug. This optimized schedule of pulsatile treatment resulted in delayed tumor growth in KRAS mutant genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). Furthermore, the combination of pulsatile MEKis with CTLA-4 blockade resulted in prolonged survival of mice with KRAS mutant lung cancer compared to continuous treatment with MEKis in combination with anti-CTLA-4.

RESULTS
MEK Inhibition Affects Tumor Growth in Kras Mutant Lung Cancer and MAPK Signaling in Both Tumor Cells and T Cells
We have treated various Kras mutant murine lung cancer cell lines (CL13, CL25, IO33, HKP1, and LLC) with selumetinib or trametinib to examine whether they are sensitive to clinically relevant MEKis. The HKP1 cell line was derived from a KrasG12D/+ Trp53-/-

mouse (Choi et al., 2015). We characterized the mutations in the IO33, CL13, CL25 and LLC cell lines and identified G12V, Q61R, Q61H, and G12C Kras mutations, respectively (Figure S1A). We observed that MEKis block phosphorylation of ERK in Kras mutant cells effectively (Figure 1A) and that tumor cells show reduced viability after treatment (Figure 1B). Furthermore, selumetinib extends the survival of HKP1 lung tumorbearing mice, suggesting cytotoxic activity on Kras mutant lung cancer in vivo (Figure 1C). When we characterized T cells, we found decreased viability and reduced pERK in CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells (Figures 1D and S1B). We also observed increased interferon (IFN) expression in lung-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, but not in CD4+ T cells after in vivo selumetinib treatment (Figure S1C), which suggests differential regulation by MEKis in distinct immune cell populations. Taken together, these data confirm that MEKis can dampen signaling in the ERK pathway in both tumor cells and T cells and that combining MEKis with immune modulation should be done carefully with respect to timing.

Short (Pulsatile), but Not Long (Continuous), Treatment with MEKis Activates T Cells Ex Vivo
To investigate how short treatment with MEKis affect T cell activation, we treated splenocytes from HKP1 lung tumor-bearing mice in vitro with selumetinib or trametinib in a long or short schedule while activating T cells using anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (Figure 2A; Figure S2). Treatment with selumetinib or trametinib reduced expression of Ki-67, 4-1BB, CTLA-4, and PD-1 from T cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B). However, short schedule treatment maintained them (Ki-67, 4-1BB, CTLA-4, and PD-1) better in CD8+ T cells and CD4+Foxp3- effector T cells, compared to long drug exposure (Figures 2B and S2). This suggests that short treatment with MEKis maintain T cells in a more activated state than continuous treatment.

Short Treatment with MEKis Increases Effector T Cell Priming
Since it has been shown previously that a MEKi (cobimetinib) reduces priming of T cells in lymph nodes (Ebert et al., 2016), we tested how short treatment with MEKis affects priming of antigen-specific (Pmel-1) CD8+ T cells. Splenocytes from Pmel-1 TCR transgenic mice were pulsed with gp100 (Pmel) peptide and treated with selumetinib or trametinib (Figure 3A). We found that MEKi treatment reduced differentiation of Pmel-1 CD8+ T cells by decreasing T-bet expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S3A), as was previously reported (Ebert et al., 2016). However, we have not observed differences in T-bet expression between the two treatment groups (Figure S3A). Selumetinib and trametinib treatment resulted in increased CD44+CD62L effector memory CD8 T cells, as well as reduced CD44+CD62L+ central memory CD8 T cells, compared to untreated samples (Figures 3B and 3C). However, short treatment with MEKis showed more CD44+ cells, specifically CD44+CD62L CD8 T cells, compared to long treatment (Figures 3B-3D). Interestingly, CD44+CD62L+ CD8 T cells and naive cells showed decreased proliferation after selumetinib treatment in both groups, while CD44+CD62L CD8 T cells showed a more proliferative phenotype compared to other subsets, regardless of treatment conditions (Figure S3B). Further-more, analysis of the supernatant after priming showed that the short­ treatment group had a higher production of IFN, suggesting better cytolytic capability (Figure 3E).

Pulsatile Treatment with MEKis Increases CTLA-4 and PD-1 Expression in Tumor­ Infiltrating T Cells compared to Continuous Treatment
Next, we investigated whether cyclical pulsatile treatment with MEKis shows differential activation of different subtypes of T cells in vivo. We treated HKP1 lung tumor-bearing mice with selumetinib (Figure 4A). After 2 weeks of treatment, lung tumors were analyzed for the activation phenotype of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Tumors were highly infiltrated by CD8+ T cells in the pulsatile treatment groups (Figures 4B and S4C). More importantly, tumor cells and CD8+ T cells showed differential proliferation (Ki-67+) with the pulsatile treatment. While proliferation of tumor cells was reduced, CD8+ T cells showed increased or stable proliferation (Figure 4C). These observations suggest that individual T cell populations respond to MEKi treatment differently. Furthermore, pulsatile treatment with selumetinib results in the maintenance of a higher level of pERK in both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, compared to continuous treatment (Figure S4), suggesting reduced suppression of MEK signaling pathways by pulsatile treatment in T cells. Consistent with ex vivo observations, CTLA-4 and PD-1 expression on CD8+ T cells were significantly higher with pulsatile treatment (Figure 4D). Additionally, PD-1 showed a significant increase in CD4+ T cells (CD4+Foxp3 and CD4+Foxp3+) and only a slight increase in CD8+ T cells (Figure 4D). We have observed similar results with pulsatile MEKi treatment at higher doses and a longer lag time (Figures S4B-S4D). T-bet expression is higher with pulsatile treatment in CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells from lung tumors (Figure S4C). Many co-stimulatory markers were increased in the regulatory T cell (Treg cell) population, but not in CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells, indicating differential regulation in subsets of T cells after pulsatile treatment (Figure S4D). Collectively, these observations indicate that pulsatile treatment with MEKi may establish a tumor microenvironment that suppresses tumor growth while maintaining optimal CD8+ activation and infiltration in the tumor microenvironment.

Pulsatile MEKi Treatment Delays Tumor Growth In Vivo
We next tested whether pulsatile treatment confers better anti-tumor activity compared with continuous dosing. We used the KrasG12D mutated HKP1 transplantable tumor model. Though there was a transient delay of tumor growth (Figure S4E), we did not observe differences in tumor progression and survival between the pulsatile and the continuous treatment groups in these settings (Figure S4F). The absence of differential effects may be due to the highly aggressive nature of these transplantable tumors.
In order to further investigate the effects of MEKi treatment regimens, we utilized the KRASG12C GEMM, an autochthonous model that has a slower tumor progression rate and allows for a better therapeutic window. Intranasal instillation of adenovirus with CRE recombinase expression similarly induces lung tumor formation, as the endogenous KrasG12D lung cancer GEMM model previously reported (Chen et al., 2012). Given the similarity of the data between selumetinib and trametinib, we focused our experiments on one MEKi, selumetinib, in the GEMM experiments. After the mice developed lung tumors, a group of mice was treated continuously with selumetinib, with similar baseline tumor volumes (Figure 5A; Figures S5A and S5B). In the first week of the treatment, these mice responded to MEKi, and tu-mor sizes started to decrease as quantified by MRI imaging (Figure 5B). In the second week, about 50% of the mice developed resistance to treatment,

and tumors regrew (Figure 5B; Figure S5B). This is consistent with prior work (Li et al., 2018) . In contrast, when we treated mice with selumetinib following a cyclical pulsatile schedule of 1 week on and 1 week off (Figure 5A), the tumors continued to respond to MEKi and had reduced tumor volume, while untreated control tumors continued to grow (Figure 5C; Figure S5B). Both the continuous and pulsatile treatment groups showed decreased levels of pERK in tumor cells compared to the control group, but the continuous group had the lowest pERK expression (Figure 5D). Supporting this pERK suppression, the MEK signaling activation gene signature (Brant et al., 2017) showed consistent suppression of the MEK signaling pathway in the majority of samples in the pulsatile and continuous groups (Figure S5C). Overall, mice treated with pulsatile selumetinib had significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with those treated with either continuous selumetinib or vehicle control. (Figure 5E).

Pulsatile Treatment Induces Anti-tumor Immunity through T Cells
To understand the potential contribution of T cells in the observed anti-tumor effect, we analyzed the lungs from the KRASG12C GEMMs at the end of each treatment with selumetinib (continuous or pulsatile schedule; Figure 5A). The percentage of tumor­ infiltrating T lymphocytes, including CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, did not show significant differences within the total infiltrating CD45+ leukocytes (Figure 6A). The percentage of Treg cells was increased with either continuous or pulsatile selumetinib treatment. However, this was not correlated with tumor volume changes in the pulsatile or continuous dosing schedule (Figures 5B, 5C, and 6A), suggesting that Tregs may not play a major role in this setting, since these two treatment schedules gave different responses despite the increase of Tregs in both conditions. At the end of pulsatile selumetinib treatment, we observed increased levels of CTLA-4 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Figure 6D; Figure S6A). Although PD-1 levels are also slightly increased in the pulsatile treatment group, the difference between control and treated groups is not statistically significant (Figure 6D; Figure S6A). On the other hand, at the end of continuous treatment with selumetinib, PD-1 expression was decreased in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, while CTLA-4 was only found to be downregulated in CD8+ T cells, as determined by both percentage and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) (Figures 6B, 6C, and S6A). The expression levels of both PD-1 and CTLA-4 are high in Treg cells. After pulsatile treatment with selumetinib, the expression levels of PD-1 and CTLA-4 remained unchanged (Figure S6B). In contrast, continuous selumetinib treatment reduced CTLA-4, but not PD-1, levels on Tregs (Figure S6B). The co-inhibitory molecules LAG3 and TIM3 did not show major expression level changes in CD4+ or CD8+ T cells with either treatment schedule (Figures 6C and 6D). Additionally, pulsatile treatment with selumetinib showed a trend toward increased CD69 and Ki-67 expression, indicating that T cells are modestly more activated after pulsatile treatment (Figure S6C). Continuous selumetinib treatment was found to decrease PD-L1 expression only in CD11b+ myeloid cells and increase its expression in CD8+ T cells. Pulsatile selumetinib treatment significantly downregulated PD-L1 levels in EpCAM+, CD11b+, and CD4+ T cells (Figure S6D). Neither pulsatile nor continuous treatment affected the infiltration of CD11b+ myeloid populations significantly (Figure S6E).

Taken together, our data show that pulsatile MEKi treatment results in improved activation of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Inter-estingly, when we used higher doses (>10-fold) of selumetinib with a pulsatile schedule in vivo (Figure 7A), there was no evident detrimental effect on the immune system in terms of T cell frequency and PD-L1 expression (Figure 7B). T cells were activated 3 days after the treatment was stopped, as determined by Ki-67 and CTLA-4 expression on CD8+ T cells (Figures 7B and 7C). In addition, high-dose pulsatile treatment with selumetinib does not seem to restrain the proliferation of T cells (Figure 7B).

Combination Therapy with Pulsatile MEKis and CTLA-4 Blockade Enhances Survival in Mice with Kras Mutated Lung Tumors
Based on the aforementioned observations, we combined CTLA-4 blockade with pulsatile selumetinib treatment to investigate whether the enhanced T cell activation associated with the pulsatile schedule can produce a better outcome in combination with the checkpoint blockade in tumor-bearing mice. We chose a high concentration of selumetinib for pulsatile treatment since proliferation and CTLA-4 expression were elevated, per the previous experiments (Figures 7B and 7C), and tested in a transplantable LLC model (same Kras mutation as the GEMM). We found that the combination of pulsatile high doses of selumetinib with a 3-day gap and CTLA-4 blockade provided the longest survival in mice as compared to other monotherapies or combination therapies (Figures 7D and 7E). The survival advantage was lost in Rag / mice, which are deficient in T and B cells (Figures 7F and 7G), suggesting that adaptive immunity contributes to improved survival in this treatment setting. Interestingly, MEKis combined with PD-1 targeting did not improve survival further (Figure S7A). In addition to the contribution of adaptive immune cells in MEKi treatment, we also observed a potential contribution of NK cells to survival in both MEKi treatment groups (Figures S7B and S7C). Although the survival difference in the anti-CTLA-4 combination is modest in our experimental settings, these results bring forth the possibility that the combination of CTLA-4 blockade with pulsatile MEKi might be considered for clinical trials as a treatment strategy for KRAS mutated lung cancers.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have demonstrated that, as opposed to conventional continuous MEKi treatment used in the clinic, a pulsatile schedule of MEKi treatment is more effective at controlling tumor progression and enhancing T cell activation with increased levels of CTLA-4 and PD-1 expression. In comparison with continuous treatment, ex vivo pulsatile treatment of T cells with MEKis (selumetinib or trametinib), alongside activation by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, resulted in increased CTLA-4 expression and, to a lesser extent, PD-1 expression. Concurrent changes of Ki-67 and 4-1BB suggest that both CD8+ T cells and CD4+Foxp3 effector cells are more activated by pulsatile treatment with MEKis. While changes in CD4+Foxp3 effector cells and CD4+Foxp3+ T cells are subtle, CD8+ T cells showed high expression levels of immune checkpoint regulators and co-stimulatory markers. This might be due to the fact that CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells are regulated through distinct signaling pathways with varying dependence on the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. In CD8+ T cells, MEK½-ERK½ signaling

is critical for cytotoxic activity, proliferation, and survival (Rincón et al., 2001; D'Souza et al., 2008). In CD4+ T cells, MEK4/6/7-p38 and JNK are more important for their activity and development (Rincón et al., 2001). This differential dependency on distinct signaling pathways may regulate responses of CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells to MEKis in a different fashion.
In addition to changes in T cells, MEKi increases major histo-compatibility complex class I (MHC I) expression, which is essential for cytotoxic T cell activation, in tumor cells (Brea et al., 2016). In our preliminary data, we observed an increase of H2-Kb MHC I expression in the CD45 cell population after pulsatile MEK inhibition in HKP1 lung tumors. However, after a 2-3 day ``washout'' period, MHC I expression decreased gradually to the levels of untreated tumors (data not shown). These data further underscore the importance of timing when MEKi treatment and combination approaches are designed.
Our in vivo data with pulsatile MEKis in a transplantable Kras model are consistent with the ex vivo observations. The effects of pulsatile MEKi treatment were more pronounced on CD8+ T cells infiltrating into tumors and their expression of CTLA-4 and PD-1. In vivo, T cells that are being treated have not been pre-selected (as opposed to ex vivo, where cells come from one anatomical location); as a result, we can speculate that cells exposed to MEKis are at different stages of T cell development in vivo. It has been shown previously that the MEK/ERK pathway is fundamental to T cell lineage commitment in the thymus during development. Genetic reduction of ERK induces more CD8+ cells from CD4+ CD8+ double-positive T cells via loss of CD4+ markers in the thymus (Rincón et al., 2001). While pERK reduction is preferable for CD8 expansion in the thymus, pERK positively regulates CD8+ T cell proliferation, survival, and IL-2 cytokine expression from CD8+ cells (Rincón et al., 2001; D'Souza et al., 2008). Furthermore, activation of MEK/ERK signaling downregulates apoptosis in activated primary peripheral T cells (Holmström et al., 2000). Thus, we can speculate that, with pulsatile MEKis, more CD8+ cells will be generated in the thymus during the treatment, then following a period without MEKis treatment may allow proliferation or reduce apoptosis of differentiated CD8+ cells globally, resulting in an expansion of CD8+ populations in the tumor. Considering this intricate role of ERK in CD8+ T cells from development to activation and survival, ERK signaling may be best modulated using a rationally designed schedule in order to maximize the frequency and activation of CD8+ T cells. Our pulsatile schedule of treatment demonstrates better control of this signaling pathway by increasing the frequency of CD8+ T cells and their expression of activation markers and immunotherapy targets in Kras mutated lung tumors.
MEK inhibition in tumor-bearing mice has been previously reported to interfere with the priming of T cells in lymph node yet enhance CD8+ T cell expansion in a CT26 tumor site due to reduced apoptosis (Ebert et al., 2016). To test whether pulsatile MEKi treatment can improve antigen-specific priming of T cells, we utilized antigen-specific, Pmel-1 transgenic CD8+ T cells pulsed with gp100 peptide. We showed that selumetinib and trametinib reduced antigen-specific activation (CD44+) in a dose-dependent manner in both continuous and pulsatile treatments, which suggests a critical role of pERK in CD8+ T cell priming. However, pulsatile MEKi treatment resulted in more CD44+CD62L cells than continuous treatment did. This observation is important, because it suggests that pulsatile

treatment leads to maintained activation when compared to conventional MEKi treatment. To clearly understand the effects of MEKis in immune priming, future work to dynamically monitor pERK expression and T cell activation marker changes with diverse types of MEKis pulsation is needed. Additionally, in vivo studies confirming whether the pulsatile schedule of MEKis enhances priming of T cells need to be pursued further.
Given the observations of T cell phenotypic changes ex vivo and in vivo in transplantable models, we further evaluated such changes, using a GEMM harboring the human KRASG12C mutation, one of the most prevalent mutation detected in NSCLC patients. We found that pulsatile treatment with MEKis have a superior anti-tumor effect and delayed drug resistance in comparison with continuous treatment. Consistent with ex vivo and in vivo transplantable model studies, the tumor-infiltrating T cells showed increased CTLA-4 and a modest upregulation of PD-1 levels, with greater proliferation and activation. In contrast, when we treated KRASG12C mutant GEMM mice with MEKis continuously, we observed reduced CTLA-4 and PD-1. Considering that the tumor cells were exposed to equal amounts of MEKis, this confirms that activated T cells resulting from pulsatile MEKi treatment could enhance anti-tumor immunity in KRAS-driven lung cancer.
In all conditions (ex vivo and in vivo in GEMM and transplantable models), we have observed that pulsatile MEKi treatment increases CTLA-4 and PD-1. Although CTLA-4 is a checkpoint molecule (Hardy and Chaudhri, 1997; Thompson and Allison, 1997; Walunas et al., 1994), counterintuitively, it is also known to be induced during early T cell activation (Chambers et al., 1996). In a similar way, while PD-1 is highly expressed on exhausted T cells, it is also a marker of T cell stimulation (Jin et al., 2011; Kansy et al., 2017; Ngiow et al., 2015). Thus, increased CTLA-4 and PD-1 associated with pulsatile MEKi treatment suggests that CD8+ T cells are more activated, and this is supported by data on Ki67 expression. Moreover, considering that exhausted T cells co-express other co-inhibitory markers like TIM-3 and LAG-3 simultaneously with PD-1, the absence of these co-inhibitory markers on T cells after pulsatile MEKi treatment supports that they are activated rather than exhausted cells. Favorable changes in CTLA-4 after pulsatile MEKi treatment warrant considering how CTLA-4 expression is regulated. It is known that CTLA-4 is regulated by ERK (Tsatsanis et al., 2008), but it is not well understood how CTLA-4 expression is regulated temporally in the presence of MEKis. A future study on the mechanism of CTLA-4 expression regulation under MEKis is necessary.
Improved anti-tumor activity and a more favorable phenotype of CD8+ T cells with increased CTLA-4 expression in the pulsatile group inspired us to test the combination of pulsatile MEKi treatment with an anti-CTLA4 antibody in Kras mutant lung cancer. We show that the combination of pulsatile high doses of selumetinib and CTLA-4 blockade prolonged survival to the greatest extent compared to other monotherapies or combination therapies, supporting that the combination of immune checkpoint blockade with pulsatile MEKis may be a more effective approach to treat Kras lung cancer. This prolonged survival was not present in immune-deficient mice, indicating that it was mediated by the adaptive immune system. A similar pulsatile treatment regimen is also currently under evaluation in a clinic for NSCLC patients with intermittent selumetinib and antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-L1 (ClinicalTrial.gov: NCT03581487). It should be noted that, since the trial did

not stratify for co-mutations in addition to KRAS, MEKi alone, which targets downstream of KRAS, may not be enough to restrain tumors with a KRAS mutation together with other co-mutations, even when combined with immunotherapy.
In this study, we have tested MEK inhibition with selumetinib and trametinib. However, other MEKis with variations in potency, target specificity, and T½ (elimination half-life) are being used (e.g., cobimetinib and binimetinib) or are in development (Caunt et al., 2015). Based on our findings, these should also be tested using different dosing and scheduling regimens to potentially allow for more effective cancer cell growth control and durable immune microenvironment activation.
In this study, we show that the pulsatile schedule alters the tumor microenvironment favorably by activating T cells and providing an advantageous anti-tumor effect in Kras­ driven lung cancer models. This schedule provides a therapeutic window for immune checkpoint blockade to improve MEKis for the treatment of KRAS-driven NSCLC patients.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cell lines and transplantable mouse model--CL13, CL25, IO33 cells lines (Jones­ Bolin et al., 1998) were obtained from Dr. Phillip A. Dennis (Lastwika et al., 2016). They were cultured in RPMI with 7.5% FBS and Pen/Strep. The HKP1 cell line was obtained from Dr. Vivek Mittal at Weill Cornell Medical College (Choi et al., 2015). LLC (Lewis Lung Carcinoma) was obtained from ATCC (CRL-1642). HKP1 and LLC were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum, L-Glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and Pen/Strep. Sex of CL13, CL25, IO33, HKP1, and LLC is female based on our sequencing analysis. KrasG12D p53f/f cell line was derived from male mouse in Dr. Kwok-Kin Wong's laboratory and cultured in RPMI with 7.5% FBS and Pen/Strep. The cell lines have been kept in culture for a limited number of passage. Cell lines are also routinely mycoplasma tested and each new cell line is mycoplasma tested by the monoclonal core facility at MSK. Cell lines are also tested for Mouse antibody production (MAP) routinely at MSK.
All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. All mice for transplantable model were 6 12 week old of age and females and tumor-bearing mice were randomized before selumetinib treatment (5 mice per group for flow cytometry analysis, 10 mice per group for survival analysis).Transplantable lung cancer was generated by intravenous injection of 1 3 105 HKP1 cells into C57BL/6J (Jax 00664) mice and monitored using the IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging system (Perkin Elmer). 50ul of 30 mg/ml D-luciferine (Perkin Elmer) was injected retro-orbitally under anesthesia using isoflurane and mice were then placed supine in an imaging chamber for imaging. Another transplantable model was generated by subcutaneous injection of

500,000 - 1,000,000 LLC cells in the flank of C57BL/6J (Jax 00664) mice or Rag1 / (Jax 002216) and tumor growth was measured by calipers. Mice were treated with selumetinib (Selleckchem, Houston, TX USA) from day 5 or day 7 to examine effect of MEKis on tumor growth and survival. Selumetinib was prepared in corn oil and administered by oral gavage twice a day as 25mg/kg for the continuous group daily and 25mg/kg or 300mg/kg for the cyclical pulsatile group according to a planned pulsatile schedule. Survival was analyzed based on the approved humane endpoints (distress and tumor size limit). 100 ug of anti-CTLA-4 was administered to a mouse twice a week for 2-3 weeks intraperitoneally with 9H10 clone for first three doses, then 9D9 clone for rest of doses. 250 ug of anti-PD-1 (RMP1-14) was administered to a mouse twice a week for three weeks intraperitoneally. To deplete NK cells, 200 ug of anti-NK1.1 antibody (PK-136) was injected twice a week for three weeks intraperitoneally.

GEMM model studies--All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and New York University School of Medicine (NYUSoM). The genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) harbors a conditional activating mutation of the human version of KRAS (KRASLSL-G12C/+) at the collagen I locus (Li et al., 2018) . CRE recombinase was induced through intranasal inhalation of 2.5×106 p.f.u. adeno-Cre (University of Iowa adenoviral core). Lung adenocarcinoma appeared 6 weeks after induction. For drug treatment studies in GEMM models, age matched littermates (15 - 21-week-old) were induced at the same time and tumor burden was monitored by MRI. Once the tumor size reached 500 mm3 (at about 12 weeks after adenoviral inoculation), mice were randomly assigned to experimental groups. We did not observe gender bias response between male and female mice, in terms of tumor growth and response to drug treatment. Mice were evaluated by MRI imaging to quantify lung tumor burden before and after drug treatment. Mice were treated with either vehicle, or 25 mg/kg selumetinib twice daily by oral gavage using either continuous (every day for 3 weeks) or cyclical pulsatile (one week on, one week off) dosing schedule. PFS was analyzed based on the standard criteria in clinical trials. Briefly, PFS was the duration between treatment start and progression, which was defined by increase of tumor size compared to the previous scan of radiological CT and the appearance of new lesions.

METHOD DETAILS
In vitro MEKis treatment--Selumetinib or trametnib (Sellekchem) were added to tumor cells in 96-well plates. Viability was measured using the CellTiter Glo luminescent viability kit (Promega) after 72 hr using a Wallace plate reader (Molecular Probe). To determine pERK after MEKis treatment, Kras mutant lung tumor cell lines and splenocytes collected from HKP1 tumor bearing mice were treated with selumetinib or trametinib for 2 hr at 37C. Selumetinib and trametinib stock solutions were prepared in DMSO and diluted in media. Cells were stimulated with 0.1 ug/ml PMA for 2 min at 37C, then immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using ice cold 95% methanol. pERK was stained using anti-pERK (#9106, Cell signaling) and goat anti-mouse Ig(H+L)-FITC (SouthernBiotech) by flow cytometry. Washout experiments were done using CD5+ splenocytes from HKP1 tumor bearing mice. CD5+ cells were collected using

CD5 microbeads (Miltenyi MACS cell separation system), then seeded in the presence of selumetinib or trametinib into flat bottom 96-well plates pre-coated with anti-CD3 (145- 2C11, 1ug/ml) and anti-CD28 (37N, 1ug/ml). After 24hrs, media (RIPA + 7.5% FBS + 0.1% b-mercaptoethanol) was replaced with MEKis (continuous group) or DMSO diluent (wash out group) and the media was changed every day with freshly prepared MEKis. At 72hrs and 96 hr, cells were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Western blot--Trametinib was used in vitro at indicated doses in 1% DMSO. Cells were treated for 24 hours before isolating protein. Protein lysate was isolated from cultured cells using RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor (50mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycho-late, 1% NP-40). Protein quantification was performed using DC Lowry assay. Antibodies for pERK (#4370), ERK½ (#9102) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies.
Ex vivo T cell priming with MEKis treatment--Pmel-1 TCR transgenic mice (Overwijk et al., 2003) were obtained from Dr. N. Restifo (National Institutes of Health). Splenocytes from a Pmel-1 mouse were stained with 5uM of CFSE (Invitrogen), then seeded at approximately 400,000 cells per well in a U-shape bottom 96 well plate with 1ug/ml of heteroclitic human gp100 peptide (AnaSpec Inc) at day 0 in 0.1% b-mercaptoenthanol supplemented RPMI media with 7.5% FBS. At the same time, splenocytes from another Pmel-1 mouse were set for priming in T175 flask. At day 2 or 3, 20U of mouse IL-2 (eBioscience) was added to the supernatant of the T175 flask that was subsequently used to prepare following treatment groups for the plate. Supernatant with MEKis (selumetinib, trametinib) were added to continuous groups according to the experimental plan. Washout groups were treated with supernatant containing IL-2 and DMSO. At day 4 or 5, 20U/ml of mouse IL-2 supplemented fresh T cell media with or without MEKis was added to support extensive cell growth, and cells were stained and analyzed at day 5 by flow cytometry
MRI quantification--Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lung field using the BioSpec USR70/ 30 horizontal bore system (Bruker) to scan 24 consecutive sections. Overall tumor volumes within the whole lung were quantified using 3D slicer software to reconstruct MRI volumetric measurements as previously described (Chen et al., 2012). Acquisition of the MRI signal was adapted according to cardiac and respiratory cycles to minimize motion effects during imaging.
Tumor-infiltrating immune cells isolation and analysis--Mice were sacrificed, and lungs were perfused using sterile PBS through heart perfusion from the right ventricle. The whole lung was minced into small pieces and digested in collagenase D (Sigma or GIBCO) and DNase I (Sigma) in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) at 37 C for 30 min. After incubation, the digested tissue was filtered through a 40 um or 70 mm cell strainer (Fisher) to obtain single-cell suspensions. Separated cells were treated with 1X RBC lysis buffer (Biolegend) to lyse red blood cells. Live cells were determined by LIVE/DEAD fixable aqua dead cell stain kit (Molecular Probes) or Fixable viability dye e506 (eBioscience). The cell pellets were re-suspended in PBS with 2% FBS for flow cytometry analysis. Cells were stained with cell surface markers as indicated followed by fixation/permeabilization

using foxp3 fixation/permeabilization kit (eBioscience). Lung infiltrating immune cells were stained with different combinations of fluorochrome-coupled antibodies and analyzed by FACS analysis.
Transcriptome analysis--RNA was extracted from 6 - 10 FFPE tissue sections using QUICK RNA FFPE kit (Zymo Research). Expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix Clariom D Pico Assay, mouse and analyzed using Transcriptome Analysis Console as previously described. (Andrzejewski et al., 2017; Nassal et al., 2017). Heatmaps were plotted in R using the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) procedure (Bolstad et al., 2003; Carvalho and Irizarry, 2010; Irizarry et al., 2003a; Irizarry et al., 2003b). Expression values were normalized using Affymetrix mta10 annotation data and gene names were translated to MGI symbols. Heatmaps of signature gene sets were extracted from a study of Brant et al. (Brant et al., 2017).
Flow cytometry analysis--Immune cells obtained via ex vivo treatment or in vivo were collected and processed as single-cell suspensions and stained with antibodies against mouse CD3 (145-2C11), CD62L (MEL-14), CD44 (IM7), T-bet (eBio4B10), CD45 (30-F11), PD-1 (J43), 4-1BB (17B5), CTLA4 (UC10-4B9), Ki67 (SolA15), Foxp3 (FJK-16 s), CD4 (GK1.5), CD8 (3B5), and fixable viability dye 506 (eBioscience) for ex vivo studies; and antibodies against mouse CD3 (17A2), CD4 (GK1.5), CD8 (53-6.7, 5H19), Foxp3 (FJK-16 s), CD11b (M1/70), CD11c (N418), Epcam (G8.8), CD279 (PD-1, 29F.1A12, J43), CD152 (CTLA-4, UC10-4B9), TIM-3 (RMT3-23), CD223 (Lag-3, C9B7W), ICOS (c398.4A), 4-1BB (17B5), GITR (DTA-1), OX-40 (OX-86), PD-L1 (10F.9G2) for in vivo studies. Staining signals were acquired on BD LSRFortessa or BD LSR II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC).
Cytokine profiling analysis--The supernatant of primed Pmel-1 with or without selumetinib was collected at day 5 after human gp-100 peptide addition and subjected to Luminex cytokine analysis using Luminex MAGPIX system and Milliplex multiplex assays mouse panel (Millipore) and analyzed using xPOTENT software (Millipore Sigma). Mouse lung bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from GEMM KRASG1C mice after the treatment was performed by intratracheal injection of 2ml of sterile PBS and collected by aspiration. Cytokines were measured using Mouse Cytokine 23-plex Assay (Bio-Rad) and measured on Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad). Concentrations [pg/ml] of each protein were derived from 5-parameter curve fitting models. Fold changes relative to the control were calculated and plotted as log2FC. Lower and upper limits of quantitation (LLOQ/ULOQ) were derived from standard curves for cytokines above or below detection.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and analyses--Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized, followed by immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against pERK (Cell Signaling) and examined using a Leica upright microscope (Liu et al., 2015b). H&E sections were examined by a pathologist at Dana-Faber Cancer Institute. Results were independently scored by two pathologists using multiplicative quick systems (Liu et al., 2015b). Briefly, the expression score of each marker was calculated by multiplying a score indicating percentage of positively stained cells within tumor cells counted (1 = 0%-4%; 2

ABSTRACT
Zygomatic abscess is a very rare complication (extra cranial) of acute otitis media. Unfamiliarity with the underlying cause of a swollen cheek can lead to delay of proper treatment with potential harm to the patient.

Introduction

Acute mastoiditis is the most common complication of acute otitis media (AOM) and its early recognition and management still poses a challenge due to potentially serious consequences. The advent of antibiotics has significantly reduced the incidence and associated morbidity of autogenic (intracranial and extrcranial) complications;[1] yet, they remain a serious clinical problem, especially when caused by bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Zygomatic abscess is very

rare complication (extra cranial) of acute otitis media. Zygomatic root abscesses have only been described in a few scattered case reports[2-4] Unfamiliarity with the underlying cause of a swollen cheek can lead to delay of proper treatment with potential harm to the patient. Friedrich Bezold (1824-1908) was one of the first who reported about this.
It is described as temporo parietal swelling secondary to mastoid abscess eroding the root of the zygomatic process.[1] Extracranial extension of mastoid infections was further characterized by Henri Luc in 1900 when he described the subperiosteal temporal abscess of otitic origin without intraosseous suppuration.[5]
The ideal treatment for these cases is modified radical mastoidectomy with drainage of abscess. Radiographic investigation of the mastoid can be useful in the diagnosis of cholesteatoma in the presence of a

subperiosteal mastoid abscess.
We herein present a rare case report of zygomatic abscess associated with otitis media along with its clinical presentation, root of spread, review of its medical and surgical management, with emphasis on the methods for accurate diagnosis.

Case Report
We report on a 55-year-old man who presented with right ear discharge with decreased hearing for 5 months and right ear ache for 2 months. It was dull aching in beginning but sharp shooting for 5 days accompanied with right-sided facial swelling [Figure 1] and decreased mouth opening for 5 days. No associated tinnitus, vertigo, or any other constitutional symptoms were present. The affected external auditory canal was swollen and erythematous. His facial nerve was intact. High-resolution computed tomography(HRCT) of temporal bone showed irregular osteolytic area involving the posterior portion of the right zygomatic process and zygomatico temporal junction, mastoid air cell, middle ear cavity with erosion of anterior, lateral, and superior wall. There is an evidence of peripherally enhancing collection seen around the right zygomatic process and it measures 3.9*1.6 cm with ill-defined swelling of the soft tissue of right temporal region (masticator space). Anterior and posterior margin of EAC also shows erosion [Figure 2]. Ear swab send for culture and sensitivity repot came as pseudomonas aurigenosa. We initiated intravenous antibiotics, which resulted in notable improvement; the patient underwent a modified radical mastoidectomy with drainage of zygomatic abscess. There was an automastoidectomy and organized granular mass completely filling the mastoid cavity with complete erosion of zygomatic process and presence of attic cholesteatoma. Histopathology sample shows no evidence of malignancy. The patients exhibited excellent postoperative recovery, without facial palsy, vertigo or other complications. The diagnosis of zygomatic abscess associated with unsafe otitis media was made.
Discussion
The incidence of complications resulting from suppurative otitis media has significantly decreased since the introduction of antibiotics. At the start of the 20th century, 50% of all cases of otitis media developed a coalescent mastoiditis. By 1959, the incidence had fallen to 0.4%. Recent studies suggest a current incidence of only 0.24%.[6]
An acute mastoiditis can occasionally present as a

and zygomatico temporal junction, mastoid air cell, middle ear cavity with erosion of anterior, lateral, and superior wall
swelling in front of the ear. An inflammation of the air cells of the mastoid cavity can spread, via the cells in the root of the zygomatic arch, to the soft tissues of the cheek. The infratemporal or zygomatic fossa is the space bounded laterally by the ramus of the mandible, medially by the lateral wall of the pharynx and pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, anteriorly by the zygomatic surface of the superior maxilla and superiorly by the lower surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid and the adjacent temporal bone. The posterior limit of the space is represented by a plane passing directly medial ward from the posterior border of the ramus of the mandible to the pharynx.[7] The diagnosis of zygomatic root abscesses some times is very difficult due to variable clinical presentations and often distinct from suppurative mastoiditis. Some times they appear as a masked condition despite the presence of a potentially fatal complication. Patients may lack

constitutional symptoms. Investigation includes advanced HRCT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the temporal bone with wider window to see soft tissue involvement and cholesteatoma in the presence of subperiosteal abscess
or to rule out intracranial extension. Treatment of the zygomatic root abscess associated with otitis media includes modified radical mastoidectomy with drainage of zygomatic abscess. Some times, patients may respond to conservative therapy alone.[3,4]
Conclusions
· In summary, zygomatic root abscess is a rare complication.
· Of acute otitis media to be a contemporary otologist, we should not overlook such severe complications of otitis media diseases.
· Appropriate intravenous antibiotics and adequate surgeries, as soon as possible, are recommended.
· Advanced HRCT scans or MRI of the temporal bone with wider windows are necessary for the diagnosis of cholesteatoma in the presence of a subperiosteal

mastoid abscess.

Abstract
The factors that lead to the improvement of gait function in patients with diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) who use a hybrid assistive limb (HAL) are not yet fully understood. The purpose of the present study was to analyze these factors to determine the prognosis of the patients' gait function. Patients whose CNS disease was within 180 days since onset were designated as the subacute-phase patients, and patients whose disease onset had occurred more than 180 days previously were designated as chronicphase patients. Fifteen subacute-phase patients and 15 chronic-phase patients were given HAL training. The study analyzed how post-training walking independence in these patients was affected by the following factors: age, disease, lesion area, lower limb function, balance, period until the start of training, number of training sessions, additional rehabilitation, higher-order cognitive dysfunction, HAL model, and the use of a non-weight-bearing walking-aid. In subacute-phase patients, walking independence was related to lower limb function (rs = 0.35). In chronic-phase patients, there was a statistically significant correlation between post-training walking independence and balance (rs = 0.78). In addition, in patients with a severe motor dysfunction that was accompanied by inattention and global cognitive dysfunction, little improvement occurred, even with double-leg model training, because they had difficulty wearing the device. The results demonstrated that the factors that improved walking independence post HAL training differed between patients with subacute- and chronic-stage CNS diseases. The findings may serve as valuable information for future HAL training of patients with CNS diseases.

Introduction
Walking is an important ability for everyday living, and for humans, it provides a high degree of freedom to respond to changes in the environment. Most patients with central nervous system (CNS) diseases experience motor paralysis of the lower limbs, and their gait function is impaired, which restricts movement in daily life.

In recent years, various gait training assistive robots have been developed, such as the Rehabot,1) Gait Trainer,2,3) Lokomat,4) and LOPES Exoskeleton Robot,5) and rehabilitation using robots is becoming more widespread. The hybrid assistive limb ([HAL], CYBERDYNE, Inc., Tsukuba, Japan) is a cyborg-type gait-assistive robot that was developed by Sankai et al.6,7) to assist with walking. It features a voluntary control function that complies with the wishes of the wearer, a function that was developed through the fusion of medicine and engineering. HAL is a new type of neurorehabilitation tool that supports the automatic movement of the hip and knee joints based on the bioelectrical signals (BES) from the wearer's rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, biceps

femoris, and gluteus maximus. Simultaneously, this suit uses information on the position of the center of gravity to determine the stance or swing phases, possesses functions that detect voluntary human movement, and offers a technological, automatic control capability to support the movement of the lower limbs in synchronization with the gait cycle.
Gait training with the gait-assistive robot suit HAL has been reported to improve the walking ability of patients with either acute8-10) or chronic stroke,11) or spinal cord injury,12,13) and effectively reduces the amount of assistance during the wearer's activities of daily livings (ADLs).14) However, there is little information on the application of HAL to rehabilitate patients with gait disorders and CNS diseases such as stroke, brain tumor, and spinal cord injury. Therefore, uncovering the factors affecting the prognosis of patient function, particularly patient characteristics such as age, disease, disease site, cognitive dysfunction, lower limb function, balance, and intervention period, will likely provide valuable information when considering how to apply HAL training.
The purpose of this study was to analyze the factors affecting the prognosis of gait function after HAL training in patients with CNS diseases.
Materials and Methods
The gait disturbance was due to intracerebral hemorrhage in 15 patients, cerebral infarction in 4, meningioma in 5, diffuse axonal injury in 3, and spinal cord disease in 3, with a consciousness level of grade 1 or grade 0 on the Japan Coma Scale (JCS).15) The study was approved by the ethical committee of the University of the Ryukyus (No. 377), and training using HAL was provided to 30 patients who were given a written explanation about their cooperation in the study and from whom informed

consent to participate was obtained. We classified patients who had started HAL training within 180 days since the onset of disease into the subacutephase group, and those who started HAL training after at least 180 days since disease onset were classified into the chronic-phase group.16,17) The subacute group (cases 1-15) consisted of 10 women and 5 men with a median age of 61 years (range: 18 to 86 years). All patients in the subacute-phase group had a lower limb deficit and gait disorder. The chronic group (cases 16-30) consisted of 3 women and 12 men with a median age of 59 years (range: 19 to 83 years). All patients in the chronic-phase group had a lower limb deficit, and 11 patients in this group had a gait disorder. The details of each patient's profile are given in Table 1.
HAL training was conducted for 30 minutes once daily. The time required to put on or remove the HAL was not included in the training time. The HAL training program consisted of sitting balance, standing balance, and gait training. Training was conducted with patients wearing either a single-leg or double-leg HAL model. Patients with paraplegia or quadriplegia and/or patients who could not maintain a sitting position used the double-leg HAL model. The single-leg HAL model was applied to patients with hemiplegia who could maintain a sitting position.18) Patients who could not maintain a sitting or standing position used an All-in-One Walking Trainer (All-in-One, manufactured by ROPOX A/S, Næstved, Denmark). A dedicated sling (DOMINO Slings, manufactured by ROPOX A/S) for the Allin-One was used, and because it could support the pelvis of the wearer and hold up the trunk of the body, it even allowed patients who were unable to maintain a seated or standing position to do so safely.
Gait function, lower limb function, balance, and ADLs were each evaluated according to the Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC),19)

Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA),20) and Functional Independence Measure (FIM)21,22) before HAL training started and when it was finished.
The neuropsychological assessments that were used are shown below. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)23) and a modified MMSE (3MS)24) were used for the global cognitive screening assessment. The flexibility of the executive function of the frontal lobe was evaluated with the Trail Making Test (TMT),25) and cognitive inhibition was evaluated with the Stroop Test (ST).25) The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) digit span subtest (DS),26) which reveals the retention operation of working memory, was used to evaluate memory function. Furthermore, the WAIS-R digit symbol test (DST)26) was used to evaluate the psychomotor speed of the entire brain. To evaluate the visuospatial ability of the parietal lobe, we used a partial WAIS-R block design subtest26) and the cube-copying test.
Spearman's rank-order correlation analysis was used to calculate correlations between the FAC when HAL training was finished and age, the period from disease onset until the start of training, number of training sessions, and scores of lower limb function and balance before training. The range of the rank-order correlation coefficient (rs) was between -1 and +1. When the rs value was close to +1, it indicated that there was a positive correlation between the FAC and scores of the other functional assessment items. Conversely, when the rs value was close to -1, there was a negative correlation between the FAC and other functional assessment items. The strength of the rs value was assessed using five categories: negligible correlation (0.00 to 0.30 or 0.00 to -0.30), low correlation (0.30 to 0.50 or -0.30 to -0.50), moderate correlation (0.50 to 0.70 or -0.50 to -0.70), high correlation (0.70 to 0.90 or -0.70 to -0.90), and very high correlation (0.90 to 1.00 or -0.90 to -1.00).27,28) If the strength of the rs value was more than 0.3, it was considered to be positively correlated, and if it was less than -0.3, it was considered to be negatively correlated. Fisher's exact test was used to test the significance between the number of patients who were capable (FAC > 1) and incapable of walking (FAC = 0) when HAL training was finished, according to seven factors: (1) lesion side, (2) disease type, (3) lesion site, (4) presence or absence of higher-order cognitive dysfunction, (5) HAL specification, (6) additional use of the All-in-One, and (7) additional occupational therapy (OT) or physical therapy (PT) (significance level: 5%). In addition, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to assess the difference in the median values of FAC, FMA (lower limb function and balance),

and FIM before HAL training started and when it was finished (significance level: 5%).
Results
HAL training was provided to 15 patients with subacute-phase CNS disease and 15 patients with chronic-phase disease. The details of each group are given in Table 2.
All functional assessments in the patients with subacute-phase disease and the those with chronicphase disease showed that there was improvement. The patients whose disease was in the subacute phase demonstrated a significant increase (P < 0.01)

in the median FAC score from 0 ± 0 (range: 0-0) before training started to 2 ± 1 (range: 0-4) when training was finished (Fig. 1A). The walking categories in the chronic phase group significantly increased (P < 0.01) from baseline (median: 3 ± 1; range: 0-5) to after training (median: 4 ± 1.8; range: 0-5) (Fig. 1A). The median score for lower limb function in the subacute and chronic-phase groups significantly improved from before training (5 ± 4.5; range: 1-14) to after training (21 ± 5.9; range: 9-29, P < 0.001), and from 17 ± 5.9 (range: 4-25) to 22 ± 5.5 (range: 9-27, P < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 1B). The balance scores of the FMA in the patients whose disease was in the subacute phase significantly increased (P < 0.001) from baseline (median: 1 ± 0.7; range: 0-2) to when training was finished (median: 7 ± 2.7; range: 2-11) (Fig. 1C). A significant increase (P < 0.001) in the median score for balance from 8 ± 3.8 (range: 0-11) to 11 ± 3.9 (range: 3-13) was observed in the patients

whose disease was in the chronic phase (Fig. 1C). The median scores for ADLs in patients in both the subacute and chronic-phase groups showed a significant improvement (P < 0.001) from 49 ± 14.2 (range: 28-70) to 82 ± 20.2 (range: 40-104), and from 100 ± 25.7 (range: 34-120) to 105 ± 24.2 (range: 45-121), respectively (Fig. 1D).
In the subacute-phase group, Fisher's exact test revealed that there was no significant bias in the number of patients who were capable (FAC  1) and incapable of walking (FAC = 0) after training (Table 3). In the chronic-phase group, Fisher's exact test showed that there was a significant bias in the number of patients who were capable and incapable of walking after training, according to the affected side (P < 0.05) and the HAL specification that was used for training (P < 0.05) (Table 3). These results showed that bilateral-side lesions and training with the double-leg HAL model affected gait function after HAL training in patients with chronic-phase disease.

The results of the Spearman's rank-order correlation analysis and FMA scores for lower limb function showed that there was a low positive correlation (rs = 0.35, P = 0.09) with the FAC scores after HAL training in the subacute-phase patients (Table 4). The chronic-phase diseases demonstrated a high positive correlation (rs = 0.78, P = 0.003) with the FMA scores for balance, and a low positive correlation (rs = 0.36, P = 0.09) with the scores for lower extremity function (Table 4).
The walking categories and the lower limb function scores for individual patients whose disease was in the subacute phase are shown in Fig. 2A. The arrows show the change in gait and lower limb function from before training started to when training was finished. The patients with a lower limb function score of 8 or higher before training experienced an improvement of the FAC score to 3 after HAL training. The patients with a lower limb function score of 5 or lower before training tended to have an FAC score that improved to 2. Figure 2B shows the change in gait function and balance scores of patients in the chronic-phase group from the start of training until it was finished. The FAC of 9 patients increased by one level after HAL training was finished, and the balance scores also improved. Eight patients who had a balance score of 7 or higher before training improved to an FAC of 3 or higher when training was finished, and 5 patients, in particular, regained walking independence. After training, there was an increase in the balance scores, but there was no change in the FAC of 2 patients with an FAC of 0 and 4 patients with an FAC of 5. Four of the 15 patients who used the double-leg model (patients 5, 10, 26, and 28) remained unable to walk. Patients 5, 10, 26, and 28 had severe motor dysfunction or quadriplegia that was complicated by higher-order cognitive dysfunction.

Discussion
The goal of this study was to analyze the factors that are related to the prognosis of gait after HAL training in patients with lower limb motor paralysis due to CNS diseases such as stroke and benign

brain tumor. We analyzed the factors that affect the prognosis of gait function after HAL training in patients with subacute- and chronic-phase disease.
The traditional rehabilitation approach, neurodevelopmental treatment, and/or robotic-assisted locomotor training for patients in the acute and chronic phases of CNS disease improved their dysfunction of the lower limb and standing balance, as well as walking ability.4,8-11,17,29,30-32) The robot-assisted training that included HAL restored the gait function and/or ADLs of patients after the subacute stage of stroke, compared with conventional rehabilitation.4,14,16,33) There is not much difference in the walking ability and/or balance of patients in the chronic stage after stroke between rehabilitation with Locomat and the conventional rehabilitation.31,34) Recently, several reports indicated that gait training with robot-suit HAL improved gait function and standing balance in patients in the chronic phase after stroke.11,34,35) Our study demonstrated that HAL training improved not only the walking ability but also the function of the lower limb, balance, and ADLs of patients with CNS diseases, both in the subacute and chronic phases. Indeed, in our study, HAL training effectively improved the function of patients with the chronic stage of CNS disease, although we found that it was difficult to recover the patients' motor functioning using conventional rehabilitation.36)
Lower limb function, represented by an FMA score of 4 or above, indicated that the tendon reflex and synergistic pattern in voluntary movement were normal.20) The BES-induced, synergistic movement of the lower limbs is triggered using HAL gait assistance.6,7) Although, the effect of HAL on gait function in patients with mild motor paralysis has been reported,8) in this study, we found that starting HAL training soon after CNS disease onset or an operation led to effective improvement of gait disorders in patients with severe motor paralysis.
The double-leg HAL model is an effective tool for the gait training of patients with paraplegia or quadriplegia with a spinal cord injury and/ or severe brain injury.10,18,34) Patients with global cognitive dysfunction and inattention remained unable to walk in this study, and could not be expected to improve their walking ability.37,38) For the double-leg HAL model to work, the wearer must use knee or hip joint movements such as bending and elongation in both legs; therefore, compared with the single-leg type model, attention must be paid to more joints, and more movement control is required.6,7)
The stability of standing balance is closely associated with the stance phase of a bipedal gait

cycle.39-43) In each step, the patient must be able to adjust the posture of the head and body so that the body's center of gravity (CG) does not fly out from the base of support.40,41,44) HAL supports the movement of the lower limbs,6,7) but the postural adjustment of the head and body depends mostly on the ability of the wearer. Patients with good standing balance may experience improvements in their walking ability because the HAL training facilitates forward propulsion of the CG and alignment of the lower limb during the stance phase.6,7,45)
This study had several limitations. Firstly, this was a retrospective study, and it was not randomized or double-blinded. Next, the number of patients with subacute- or chronic-stage disease was very small. We plan to perform a randomized double-blind study with a larger number of subjects to have solid proof of the utility of HAL for training. The factors that help improve the effect of HAL training on lower limb function and balance must be further analyzed.
In conclusion, we found that the walking ability of patients with CNS disease after HAL training was influenced by lower limb function, standing balance, and higher-order cognitive dysfunction. These findings are valuable for predicting the prognosis of gait function after HAL training in patients with a CNS disease and for considering the application of HAL to rehabilitation.

Riding the rails - different modes for RNA complex transport in axons

Ofri Abraham, Mike Fainzilber*

Neurons are highly polarized cells with axons that innervate distant targets. The distance of subcellular compartments from the nucleus requires sophisticated transport mechanisms and local action of vital processes for proper function and rapid responses to local stimuli (Terenzio et al., 2017). This is partially achieved by transport of mRNAs to subcellular locations and regulation of local translation for axonal growth, branching, synaptic plasticity, and regeneration, among other needs. Axonally synthesized proteins support neuronal survival, and axonal development, maintenance, and growth (Rishal and Fainzilber, 2014; Dalla Costa et al., 2021). Thus, understanding the mechanisms that promote RNA transport to subcellular locations in neurons will contribute to the development of novel strategies to enhance axon regeneration and survival.
In the axon, a variety of cargos are transported bi-directionally along microtubules to control neuronal functions such as neurite elongation and neuronal polarization. Microtubules are intrinsically polar, with a fast-growing plus end and an opposite slow-growing minus end. In axons, microtubule plus ends extend to the axon terminal while minus ends align towards the cell body. This polarity allows unidirectional movement in the axons with kinesins moving towards the plus end, mediating anterograde transport to axon tips, and cytoplasmic dynein moving towards the minus end, enabling retrograde signaling to cell bodies (Terenzio et al., 2017). The number of cargos far exceeds the number of molecular motors and ranges from membrane organelles through large macromolecular complexes to viruses (Salogiannis and Reck-Peterson, 2017). In addition, defects in microtubulebased transport and mutations in the motors can themselves lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders (Sleigh et al., 2019).
The canonical view of microtubule-based transport is that specific cargo adaptors recruit molecular motors to cargos. However, an alternative mechanism of cargo motility, termed hitchhiking, was recently described. Evidence suggests some cargos can achieve motility by hitchhiking on organelles that are already linked to motors, rather than directly binding molecular motor complexes themselves. Thus, motile membranous organelles can provide platforms for the movement of other cargos (Salogiannis and Reck-Peterson, 2017). Here we review recent studies on RNA transport in neurons, revealing multiple modes of motility employed by different RNAs and RNA binding proteins (RBPs).

Hitchhiking modes of transport have been described for diverse types of RNAs in axons. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding regulatory RNAs, which have been identified in the axonal compartment together with their precursor miRNAs (premiRNA) (Corradi and Baudet, 2020). How are miRNAs transported and localized to axons? Gershoni-Emek et al. (2018) identified miRNAs, Dicer, and Argonaute-2 in motor neuron axons far from the perinuclear region and demonstrated that these silencing machinery components can be associated with mitochondria. Furthermore, live-cell imaging revealed that miR-124 is actively transported with acidic compartments in axons, and associates with stalled mitochondria at growth cones and axonal branch points, where local translation was shown to occur (Gershoni-Emek et al., 2018). Another recent publication described axonal transport of pre-miRNAs on late endosomes/ lysosomes (Corradi et al., 2020). These findings suggest that miRNAs and their precursors, and perhaps also other noncoding RNAs, can be transported to axons in association with different membranous organelles.
mRNAs are transported together with RBPs as ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) to distal subcellular locations for local translation. A recent study suggested that certain axonal RNA granules are also transported by associating with endosomes in axons (Cioni et al., 2019). Cioni et al. (2019) reported that RNPs associate with motile Rab7a endosomes along retinal ganglion cell axons, and that these RNPbearing Rab7a endosomes also associate with ribosomes. In addition, they used live imaging to show that Rab7a endosomes often pause on mitochondria and that these contacts coincide with translational hotspots, suggesting that the RNP-bearing late endosomes are sites of local protein synthesis. Endosomes traffic diverse cargos within axons (Terenzio et al., 2017), and their usage as a platform for transport and localization of RNPs may integrate different pathways.
A third example of a hitchhiking mechanism proposed lysosomes as another transport platform for RNA granules in neurons (Liao et al., 2019). These authors used a combination of proximity labeling proteomics, live-cell microscopy, and in vitro biophysical modeling to identify Annexin A11 as a molecular tether that can dynamically couple RNA granules with lysosomes in primary cortical neurons. Annexin A11 possesses an N-terminal low complexity domain, which promotes its phase separation into membrane-less RNA

Perspective
granules, and a C-terminal membranebinding domain, which enables interactions with lysosomes. The findings suggest that lysosomes may also provide platforms for neuronal RNA transport, recruiting RNA granules through a molecular tether that links the granule to lysosome membranes. Moreover, since the endolysosomal system is very dynamic, the findings of Cioni et al. (2019) and Liao et al. (2019) may reflect a continuum of related membranebound organelles as platforms for RNA transport (Table 1). These platforms may enable the convergence of miRNAs, mRNA, and mitochondria for regulation of local translation by specific stimuli. The functional roles of such complexes will be of interest for future studies.
In contrast to the above examples of hitching a ride on organelles, other recent studies have described direct interactions of RNAs and their carriers with motors for axonal transport. Baumann et al. (2020) showed that adenomatous polyposis coli protein is linked to the heterotrimeric kinesin-2 KIF3A/B/KAP3 through the cargo adaptor KAP3 to drive the transport of specific axonal mRNA packages (Baumann et al., 2020). Using microscale thermophoresis and in vitro motility assays together with TIRF microscopy, Baumann et al. (2020) identified a minimal complex of proteins that can transport mRNAs with 3'UTRs enriched in guanine. Moreover, these G-motif- containing RNA sequences increase transport efficiency and balance access of different mRNAs to the transport system. Although this study has not yet been confirmed in vivo, the in vitro findings suggest that adenomatous polyposis coli can drive the transport of specific mRNA packages in axons by direct binding to motor proteins. It will be of interest to see if this mechanism is also exploited by other RBPs that bind guaninerich RNA sequences.
A second motor-based transport system was identified in hippocampal neurons, where the APP tail-1 (PAT1) protein was shown to be involved in the transport of -actin mRNA into dendrites, by direct binding to the kinesin-I motor complex and the RBP zipcode-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) (Wu et al., 2020). ZBP1 is the main RBP for -actin mRNA, and the study used yeast two-hybrid to identify PAT1 as an adapter linking ZBP1 and KLC1 or KLC2 (KLC1/2), the cargobinding subunits of kinesin. ZBP1 binds to the -actin mRNA 3'UTR concomitantly with N terminal binding to PAT1, thereby bridging the complex to KLC1/2 and activating the kinesin-I motor complex for microtubuledependent -actin mRNA transport. This study shows that motor proteins can transport RNA via membrane-free direct protein-protein and protein-mRNA binding interactions.
Fukuda et al. (2021) identified another system of RNA granule transport by direct binding to a kinesin motor. They used livecell imaging of dorsal root ganglion sensory

neurons to show that splicing factor proline/ glutamine-rich (SFPQ) - containing transport granules move in axons with microtubule motors. SFPQ co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses identified KIF5A and KLC1 as the major molecular motors responsible for anterograde axonal transport of SFPQ. Both KLC1 and KIF5A have highly divergent C-terminal regions, which ensures specificity of binding in this case. Furthermore, these authors showed that RNA molecules are required for SFPQRNA interaction with KIF5A/KLC1 (Fukuda et al., 2021). The findings suggest that binding to RNA cargos may induce a conformational change in SFPQ that facilitates axonal transport of SFPQ RNA granules by binding to KIF5A and its cargo adaptor KLC1, a mechanism that may be mirrored by other membrane-free RBP-kinesin complexes. Structural studies on SFPQ complexed with different RNA cargos will be of interest to shed further light on this mechanism.
We recently described the motor-binding mechanism for the RBP nucleolin in axons, establishing another example of a membrane-less RBP-kinesin complex (Doron-Mandel et al., 2021). Nucleolin is a multifunctional RBP, which we previously showed to be important for axonal transport of mRNAs that regulate neuronal growth and survival (Perry et al., 2016; Terenzio et al., 2018). Our recent study used biochemical assays and proteomics to show that kinesinmediated transport of nucleolin is dependent on its Glycine-Arginine-Rich (GAR) domain in dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons. The nucleolin-kinesin interaction is direct, mediated by binding of the GAR domain to KLC2 (and likely also other KLCs). We generated a nucleolin GAR deletion mouse model by gene editing, and although the homozygous mutant is embryonic lethal, experiments with heterozygotes confirmed that the GAR domain is required for axonal localization of nucleolin and its cargo mRNAs (Doron-Mandel et al., 2021). Moreover, heterozygous GAR deletion neurons show accelerated outgrowth in culture, and expression of the GAR domain as a dominant-

negative has similar effects, in line with the predictions of our previously proposed length sensing and neuron growth control model (Rishal et al., 2012). Finally, the GAR domain also functions in plasma membrane association and nucleolar localization of nucleolin. We suggest that GAR domains may act as multifunctional subcellular localization elements for a range of RBPs, potentially explaining their implication in different neurodegenerative diseases.
In summary, a flurry of recent studies has reported multiple modes of transportation employed by different RNAs and RBPs in axons (Table 1). The studies highlight diverse carriers for mRNA transport to axons, utilizing both membrane-associated and membrane-free transport modalities. A number of questions arise, for example, if and how local translation might be regulated on or within these carriers? How do axons avoid or regulate the degradation of RNA or nascent proteins by lysosomes when those are part of the carrier complex? How can neurons regulate the recruitment of RBPs to motor proteins? Future studies on these and related questions will shed light on the dynamics and specificity of these different transport complexes and will be critical to devise specific perturbations to address their physiological importance in axonal maintenance and regeneration.

Objectives: In Africa, Nigeria has the largest economy and the greatest investment in agriculture. Yet, the country ranks 103rd of 116 in the Global Hunger Index, and only 23% of children receive diets with the minimum diversity. Inadequate consumption of nutrient-dense foods is an underlying cause of undernutrition. This study qualitatively evaluated the food production and consumption of rural households in Bauchi State, Nigeria.
Methods: Data were collected via six focus group discussions with 48 women of child-bearing ages 16-33 years, from farming households in six Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Bauchi State. Discussions were conducted in the Hausa language; audio-recorded, transcribed, translated into English, analyzed and organized into themes.
Results: Emerging themes include foods produced and consumed, food processing/preservation methods, foods perceived as nourishing and experiences of hunger. Commonly produced foods included nine

starchy staples, seven legumes/oil seeds, 11 vegetables, four types of fruits and eight types of livestock. In three of six LGAs, commonly consumed foods were from only three food groups including starchy staples, legumes and vegetables. Dairy was listed only in two LGAs and meat in one LGA. Husbands reportedly ate good food, including meat outside the home, but such foods were often unavailable for household members. Participants believed that because they are women, and live in villages, one should eat whatever is available. Crops produced for their cash value were often not consumed. Harvested crops were preserved/processed via traditional methods associated with nutrient losses, including sun-drying and winnowing off the outer layers of milled grains. Mothers generally knew what foods were nourishing, but did not provide these for their children because these were sold for financial gain. Widespread food shortages, initially perceived to affect only women, reportedly disrupted household harmony and precipitated visible signs of child malnutrition.
Conclusions: A variety of agricultural food products that can contribute to adequate nutrient intakes are produced by rural households in Bauchi State, yet diets are limited in diversity. Thus, urgent strategies are needed to promote dietary diversity, and optimize the food systems for improved nutrition of women and children.

Background. Immunosuppressed patients, especially haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, are particularly vulnerable to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). However, uptake of pneumococcal vaccination tends to be lower in the immunosuppressed, partly due to concerns of vaccine effectiveness. Our institution introduced protocolised 10- or 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccination (PCV) to all allogeneic and autologous HSCT recipients in 2010 to replace routine 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23).
Methods. We conducted a retrospective single-centre observational study of all HSCT recipients from 2004 to 2015 to assess the impact of PCV introduction on IPD incidence. All HSCT recipients were reviewed for microbiological evidence of IPD following HSCT. The pre-2010 group of HSCT recipients who did not receive PCV, were compared with the post-2010 group of HSCT recipients who did receive PCV. Enrolment and compliance with the post-HSCT vaccination protocol was assessed.
Results. Of the 917 HSCT screened for IPD, 14 episodes of IPD occurred in 12 patients between 2004 and 2016. Twelve episodes occurred in the pre-2010 group, 40% of serotyped isolates would have been covered by PCV. Two episodes occurred in the post-2010 group, neither isolate serotype was covered by PCV. There was >90% enrolment and vaccination protocol completion for surviving HSCT recipients. Overall IPD rate reduced significantly from 31.9/1,000 transplants pre-2010, to 3.7/1,000 transplants post-2010 group (P < 0.05). Specific reductions occurred in the autologous transplant group from 26.2 to 2.8/1,000 transplants (P < 0.05) and the allogeneic transplant group from 45.5 to 5.3/1,000 transplants (P < 0.05).
Conclusion. Introduction of PCV resulted in a significant reduction in IPD among our high-risk cohort, demonstrating clinical effectiveness of PCV in HSCT recipients and confirming immunogenicity data. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the clinical effectiveness of PCV in this group, highlighting the importance of this vaccination to prevent infectious complications following allogeneic and autologous HSCT. The clinical effectiveness of PCV vaccine is enhanced by the high quality of our post-HSCT vaccination program.

Conclusion. Autopsies of HCT recipients frequently identify clinically significant infections which were not suspected pre-mortem. Our study reinforces the educational value of the autopsy, which is underutilized but can be employed to help prevent future similar infectious complications and improve patient outcomes.

Session: 151. Viruses and Bacteria in Immunocompromised Patients Friday, October 5, 2018: 12:30 PM Background. The human gut serves as a critical reservoir for bacteria and plasmids that encode antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Antibiotic exposure contributes to the acquisition of such ARGs; consequently efforts to curtail development of antibiotic resistance focus on minimizing exposure through antibiotic stewardship programs. Cancer chemotherapy (CC) drugs often possess potent antimicrobial properties; however, their contribution to the development of gut ARGs has not been well documented. We sought to evaluate the contribution of CC agents to the development of gut microbial ARGs using metagenomic sequencing.
Methods. We collected stool samples pre- and post-initiation of chemotherapy in antibiotic-naïve patients receiving antineoplastic agents for cancer treatment. Antineoplastic agents included fludarabine, busulfan, cyclophosphomide, mesna and melphalan for induction chemotherapy or conditioning during stem cell transplantation. We performed metagenomic shotgun sequencing on these samples and compared the relative abundance of ARGs pre- and post- treatment initiation. Three thousand and twenty-one ARGs were categorized into 15 functional pharmaceutical classes (by agents used for patient care or environmental cleaning). For group comparisons t-test and/or two-way ANOVA was performed.

Background. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative treatment option for patients with hematologic malignancies and other diseases but carries a significant risk of infection-related morbidity and mortality. Many of these infections are difficult to diagnose and treat. It is not infrequent that HCT recipients die from infection despite extensive investigations and broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. Autopsy is the gold standard for establishing the cause of death but rates of performing autopsies are decreasing despite their immense value. We present the most recent case series of infectious diseases found on autopsy in HCT recipients at our high-volume academic transplant center.
Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts and autopsy records of 131 HCT recipients who underwent autopsy between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2016. The premortem clinical diagnoses as documented by the clinical teams were compared with autopsy findings. Discrepancies were identified and classified according to the Goldman Criteria (NEJM 1983; 308:1000-5).
Results. A total of 4,072 patients received 4,395 transplants between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2016. Of the 1,937 patients who died, 131 (7%) had an autopsy performed. Of these 131 patients, 24 (18%) patients had a total of 29 infections that were identified only postmortem; 4 (3%) patients had >1 such infection. Of these 29 infections, 15 (52%) were viral, 9 (31%) were fungal, 3 (10%) were bacterial, and 2 (7%) were parasitic; no mycobacterial infections were found. According to the Goldman Criteria, 22 (76%) had class I discrepancies ("major diagnoses for which detection before death would in all probability have led to a change in management that might

Results. Seven patients provided pre- and post samples. Overall there was a trend toward reduction/eradication of ARGs in 10 of 15 of antibiotic resistance gene classes. For the rifampin class no ARGs were noted in either pre- or post-samples. For four of the ARG classes (aminoglycoside, -lactamase, fosfomycin, multidrug efflux pumps), there was an acquisition or trend toward an increase in ARG abundance.
Conclusion. Cancer chemotherapy agents may be contributory to the acquisition of aminoglycoside, -lactamase, fosfomycin, multi-drug efflux pump resistance genes in cancer patients. Of note, these genes confer resistance to some of the most important therapeutic or environment cleaning compounds utilized during clinical care. Further studies are warranted and ongoing to confirm these findings and overcome sample size limitations.

Ovarian cancer is one of the neoplasms affecting the reproductive tract associated with high mortality rate because of limited therapeutic options and an elevated incidence of chemoresistance and recurrence. In this context, immunotherapy may constitute a promising approach to improve survival rates and clinical outcome, raising the need for specific target antigens. Cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) are considered promising candidates in this sense because they are aberrant expressed by various malignancies but not by non-transformed tissue, with the exception of testes. Here, we examined the expression and potential to promote humoral immune responses of a novel CTA, A-kinase anchor protein 4 (AKAP4), among 38 ovarian carcinoma patients. Our results reveal that AKAP4 was expressed at both the mRNA and protein levels in 89% (34/38) of ovarian carcinoma tissue specimens but not in 21 matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues. In addition, a humoral response against AKAP4 was detected in 58% (22/38) of ovarian carcinoma patients by ELISA. In particular, 65% (22/34) patients bearing an AKAP4-expressing tumor exhibited circulating anti-AKAP4 antibodies. Interestingly, the majority of specimens were categorized as ovarian serous adenocarcinoma and serous papillary carcinoma, of which 93% (28/30) and 100% (6/6), respectively, expressed AKAP4. A humoral response against AKAP4 was detected in 79% (19/24) and 67% (4/6) of ovarian serous adenocarcinoma and serous papillary carcinoma patients, respectively. The presence of circulating anti-AKAP4 antibodies suggests the AKAP4 is highly immunogenic in ovarian serous carcinoma patients. Our study lays the foundations for exploring AKAP4 as a potential target for the immunotherapy of ovarian cancer.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is one of the gynecological malignancies associated with worst prognosis. In 2010, 21,888 women were estimated to receive a diagnosis of ovarian cancer in the United States and 13,850 deaths to occur because of ovarian cancer.1 Ovarian serous carcinoma is the most prevalent (epithelial) subtype of ovarian cancer and accounts for about 80-90% of all ovarian cancers. As many other malignancies, early-stage ovarian cancers are often asymptomatic and hence are diagnoses often are made at an advanced disease stage, when therapeutic modalities are limited. Therefore, there is a need to explore alternative approaches to improve the clinical management of ovarian cancer patients, including immunotherapeutic strategies such as

tumor-associated antigen-targeting vaccines, dendritic cell-based therapies, monoclonal antibody-based approaches and passive immunotherapy.2
Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment modality over standard chemotherapy because it is generally associated with reduced side effects and hence an improved quality of life for patients. In this regard, cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) have been indicated as a potential targets for antigen-specific immunotherapy because they are not found in somatic tissues except testes but are highly expressed by various malignancies and often trigger humoral immune responses in cancer patients.2 One of the best-characterized CTA, sperm-associated antigen 9 (SPAG9) is expressed by multiple neoplasms but not in adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs).2 Interestingly, humoral

Figure 1. AKAP4 expression in representative Stage I, Stage II, Stage III and Stage IV ovarian cancer tissue specimens. Tissue samples were analyzed by RT-PCR with AKAP4-specific primers. No AKAP4 expression was detected in matched adjacent non-cancerous tissue (ANCT) specimens. Testis cDNA was used as a positive control, while  actin was quantified as an internal loading control.

responses against SPAG9 were demonstrated in 67% (20/30) of epithelial ovarian cancer patients,3 77% (40/52) of renal cell carcinoma patients,4 80% (80/100) of breast cancer patients,5 80% (54/66) of cervical cancer patients,6 78% (92/118) of thyroid cancer patients,7 88% (106/120) of chronic myeloid leukemia patients,8 70% (38/54) of colorectal cancer patient9 and 72% (36/50) of endometrial cancer patients investigated in this respect.10 The immunogenicity of CTAs can be explained by the lack of MHC Class I expression on the surface of germ cells, which de facto renders testes an immunoprivileged site.11 Moreover, the education of T cells takes place in the thymus during early embryonic development, whereas spermatogenesis only starts once the puberty is attained. By that time, the immune system has refined its ability to distinguish "self " from "non-self." As a result, new antigens expressed during spermatogenesis in the testes have never been encountered by the immune system and could be immunogenic. This renders CTAs, which are aberrantly expressed by various cancers, optimal candidate targets for cancer immunotherapy.
In ovarian cancer patients, the expression as well the presence of humoral or cellular immune responses have been documented only for a few CTAs, namely NY-ESO-1,12 LAGE12 and sperm protein 17 (SP17).13-15 However, NY-ESO-1, LAGE and SP17 are generally expressed to low levels by ovarian tumors and are poorly immunogenicity, raising the need to identify and characterize novel CTAs. An ideal candidate target for immunotherapy should indeed be immunogenic, expressed to high levels by tumor cells (and not, or to very low levels by normal tissues) and localize to cell surface. Here, we explored the possible clinical utility of a new CTA, A-kinase anchor protein 4 (AKAP4), which we identified based on these criteria.16,17 We examined the expression of AKAP4 at the mRNA and protein levels in various ovarian carcinoma specimens by RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, revealing that AKAP4 was expressed in 89% (34/38) of ovarian tissue specimens but not in matched ANCTs. Further, we detected an anti-AKAP4 humoral response in 58% of ovarian carcinoma patients, irrespective of disease stage and subtype. This study lays the foundations for exploring AKAP4 as a novel target for the immunotherapy of ovarian cancer.

Results
AKAP4 is expressed in ovarian serous carcinoma tissue specimens. Our RT-PCR analysis revealed AKAP4 mRNA expression in 89% (34/38) of all ovarian carcinoma samples investigated in this sense but not in matched ANCTs. The detection of AKAP4 transcripts in all stages (Stage I, Stage II, Stage III and Stage IV) of ovarian carcinoma and in testes is shown in Figure 1. AKAP4 expression was detected in 93% (28/30) serous adenocarcinomas and 100% (6/6) serous papillary carcinomas. The sole endometroid adenocarcinoma specimen (representing a relatively rare clinical sub-type of ovarian cancer) that was available exhibited no AKAP4 expression. Along similar lines, no AKAP4 expression was observed in a benign tumor (adenofibroma). Of note, AKAP4 transcripts were detected in 100% (7/7) Stage I, 71% (5/7) Stage II, 85% (11/13) Stage III and 100% (11/11) Stage IV tissue specimens (Table 1). Localization studies of AKAP4 expression by in situ RNA hybridization revealed a chocolate brown reactivity upon hybridization with anti-sense riboprobes (Fig. 2). As expected, sense riboprobes failed to hybridize to tissue specimens.
Validation of AKAP4 protein expression in ovarian serous carcinoma tissue specimens. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to validate the expression of AKAP4 at the protein level. Interestingly, there was no discrepancy between AKAP4 expression at the mRNA and protein levels. AKAP4 was indeed expressed in 89% (34/38) of ovarian carcinoma specimens but not in matched ANCTs. In particular, the AKAP4 protein was detected in 93% (28/30) serous adenocarcinoma and 100% (6/6) serous papillary carcinoma samples. Moreover, we failed to detect AKAP4 by immunohistochemistry in one endometroid adenocarcinoma and one adenofibroma specimens. Similar to what observed at the mRNA level, 100% (7/7) Stage I, 71% (5/7) Stage II, 85% (11/13) Stage III and 100% (11/11) Stage IV tissue specimens were positive for AKAP4 protein expression (Fig. 3; Table 1). Neither ovarian cancer samples probed with unspecific, control IgGs nor ANCT specimens probed with polyclonal anti-AKAP4 antibodies stained positively for AKAP4 expression.

The mean + 2SD (0.257) of antibody titers of healthy donors was used as a cut-off value above which samples would considered positive for anti-AKAP4 humoral responses. Circulating antiAKAP4 antibodies were detected in 58% (22/38) of all ovarian carcinoma patients. In particular, the sera from 79% (19/24) serous adenocarcinoma and 67% (4/6) serous papillary carcinoma patients were found to contain anti-AKAP4 antibodies. No anti-AKAP4 humoral responses were observed in the serum of one endometroid adenocarcinoma and one benign adenofibroma patient. Anti-AKAP4 antibodies were found in patients representative of all ovarian serous carcinoma FIGO stages, including 100% (7/7) Stage I, 43% (3/7) Stage II, 61% (8/13) Stage III and 36% (4/11) Stage IV tumors (Fig. 4A). The presence of circulating anti-AKAP4 antibodies was confirmed by immunoblotting, de facto validating the results of ELISA tests (Fig. 4B, Lane 3-6). Thus, the sera of healthy donors exhibited no immunoreactivity (Fig. 4B, Lane 7). Finally, the specificity of patient-derived anti-AKAP4 antibodies was confirmed by means of a neutralization experiment. To this aim, the patient serum was pre-incubated with 15 g/mL recombinant AKAP4 protein, resulting in the complete loss of immunoreactivity (Fig. 4B, Lane 8).

Ovarian cancer remains among the leading causes of cancerrelated mortality worldwide.1 It is asymptomatic at early stages and hence diagnosed most often at advanced stages, when the therapeutic options are limited. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are needed that overcome the poor response to chemotherapy and frequent recurrence of ovarian cancer.18 In this context, immunotherapeutic regimens including antigen-specific, dendritic cell-based, adoptive cell transfer-based immunotherapy and monoclonal antibody-based approaches, represent a promising alternative to conventional therapy.2
Malignant cells of distinct histological origin, including ovarian cancer cells, can elicit tumor-specific immune responses,15 suggesting that immunotherapy might be exploited to eradicate neoplastic cells from the body. However, the success of immunotherapeutic regimens is dictated by the how the tumor and the host interact in the course of therapy (e.g., whether malignant cells can establish or not immunosuppression). Importantly, some cytotoxic agents are capable of triggering an "immunogenic" cell death, wherein, chemotherapy-induced cell death invokes a tumor-specific immune response that eliminates residual tumor cells.19 Anthracyclines, oxaliplatin and X-rays exemplify the stimuli that trigger bona fide immunogenic cell death.19 These observations suggest that following standard surgery and chemotherapy, immunotherapy can enhance stimulate antitumor immune responses to remove the residual disease and hence to prevent relapse.19 In this regard, CTAs represent a promising candidate targets for the development of anticancer immunotherapy, as they are abundantly expressed by malignant cells but virtually not by somatic tissues, exception made for the tested.2 Although

the biological role of CTAs is not completely understood, their association with cellular proliferation, migration and invasions is well-established.2 Nevertheless, CTAs are viewed as the closest possibility to exploit the concept of the "magic bullet," as theorized by Paul Ehrlich at the beginning of the 20th century, for cancer therapy.20
The potential of specific CTAs for the implementation of antigen-specific immunotherapeutic regimens against ovarian cancer has already been proved. For instance, sperm-associated antigen 9 (SPAG9) has recently been shown to generate humoral responses in 67% of epithelial ovarian cancer patients, including in 62.5% of patients affected by early-stage (Stage I + Stage II) and in 68% of individual bearing late-stage (Stage III + Stage IV) disease.3 Of note, antibodies against SPAG9 were detected in patients affected by all stages of epithelial ovarian cancer but not in healthy donors. In addition, humoral responses against SPAG9 were documented in 77% (40/52) of renal cell carcinoma,4 80% (80/100) of breast cancer,5 80% (54/66) of cervical cancer,6 78% (92/118) of thyroid cancer,7 88% (106/120) of chronic myeloid leukemia,8 70% (38/54) of colorectal cancer9 and 72% (36/50) of endometrial cancer patients investigated in this respect.10 Owing to its immunogenicity and expression by a majority of patients, SPAG9 constitutes a promising candidate for the immunotherapeutic targeting of ovarian carcinoma. However, future studies are warranted to investigate the T-cell epitopes of SPAG9 and whether SPAG9-specific T-cell responses also develop spontaneously in cancer patients. This knowledge could be used to achieve potent tumor-specific immune responses which dendritic cell-based approaches, monoclonal antibody-based strategies and combinatorial regimens including conventional chemotherapeutics and antigen-specific immunotherapy.
Additional CTAs that have been shown to generate humoral responses in ovarian cancer patients include OY-TES-1 (10%),21

LAGE-1 (25%)12 and SSX (2.27%).22 However, the cellular response against these antigens is yet to be explored. Recent studies indicate that malignancies are under the control of an immunosurveillance mechanism, as revealed by the direct association between the abundance of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes and patient survival.23 Tumor-associated antigens that have been reported to trigger a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response include NY-ESO-1 and sperm protein 17 (SP17). The identification of a DR52b-restricted NY-ESO-1 epitope (NY-ESO-1119-143, core region 123-137) that is recognized by NY-ESO-1-specific CD4+ T-cell clones is an important step for the immunological monitoring of clinical trials targeting this important CTA.24 An independent Phase I clinical trial demonstrated that NY-ESO-1

can used as a target for vaccination in advanced and high-risk ovarian cancer patients.25 However, this approach is limited by absent expression of NY-ESO-1 by recurrent tumors, calling for the development of strategies that simultaneously target multiple tumor-associated antigens.25 In a preclinical setting, the immunization of C57Bl/6 mice with the SP17 protein and a CpG oligonucleotide-based adjuvant protected them from the progression and spread of a syngeneic tumor.13 This substantiates the possibility that SP17 may constitute a valid target for the development of anticancer vaccines. Additional CTAs that may be represent promising target for the immunotherapy of ovarian cancer are Piwil2, AKAP3 and SCP-1.26-28 Taken together, these observations indicate that further studies are warranted for the development of

polyvalent anticancer vaccines that can counteract the multiple mechanisms of immune evasion harnessed by tumor cells.
Recently, a novel CTA, AKAP4, has been shown to be expressed and to elicit humoral immune response in multiple myeloma and prostate cancer models.16,17 AKAP4 was expressed in the cytoplasm and on the surface of the prostate cancer LnCaP cells as well as in tissue specimens from prostate cancer patients. In addition, an MHC-I restricted CTL response specific for AKAP4 was demonstrated in prostate cancer patients. Cytokine profiling revealed increased levels of interferon  (IFN) and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) but no significant alterations in the levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-10, clearly indicating that a CD8+

T-cell immune response arises against AKAP4 in prostate cancer.17 The ability to elicit spontaneous immune response, which are often characterized by the production of specific circulating antibodies, is a fundamental prerequisite for tumor antigens to be exploitable as targets for the immunotherapy of different tumors. In an attempt to explore the clinical implications of AKAP4 as a candidate antigen for the targeting of ovarian serous carcinoma, we analyzed the expression of AKAP4 as well as the presence of circulating anti-AKAP4 antibodies in 38 ovarian carcinoma patients. By indirect immunofluorescence assays, we detected AKAP4 at the surface of various ovarian cancer cell lines (data not shown). It is interesting to note that Stage I clinical specimens

The following AKAP4-specific primers, which were designed from overlapping exons in order to avoid genomic DNA contamination, were used: AKAP4fwd: 5'-TGA TAC TAC AAT GAT GTC TGA TGA T-3'; AKAP4rev 5'-GGA ACT AGC AGC ATC CTT GTA ATC TTT ATC-3'. Testis cDNA was used as a positive control. The mRNA coding for  actin was quantified as a loading control with the following primers: fwd 5'-ATC TGG CAC CAC ACC TTC TAC AAT GAG CTG CG-3'; rev 5'- CGT CAT ACT CCT GCT TGC TGA TCC ACA TCT GC-3' primers. The specificity of amplicons was confirmed by sequencing.
In situ RNA hybridization. The presence of the AKAP4 mRNA was examined in serial tissue sections of ovarian cancer patients by using DIG-labeled sense and anti-sense riboprobes based on the DIG Nucleic Acid Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH), as previously described.14
Immunohistochemical analyses. Serial sections of ovarian carcinoma specimens were subjected to deparaffinization and rehydration in a series of alcohol. Sections were treated with 10% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 1 h to quench endogenous peroxidases. The blocking of unspecific binding sites was achieved by incubating samples in 5% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Subsequently, sections were probed with rat polyclonal anti-AKAP4 antibodies at 4°C overnight (in a humidified chamber). Primary antibodies were revealed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgGs (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) as a substrate. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin, mounted and imaged. The AKAP4 immunoreactivity score (AKAP4+ cells) was calculated by a senior pathologist as the percentage of AKAP4 immunoreactive cells among 500 cells

from 5 random fields. Specimens exhibiting  10% AKAP4+ cells were considered negative for AKAP4 expression.
ELISA tests. Humoral responses against recombinant AKAP4 in the serum of ovarian carcinoma patients sera were analyzed by ELISA. Plates were coated with 500 ng recombinant purified AKAP4 and incubated at 4°C overnight. Non-specific binding sites were blocked by incubating plates with 3% non-fat skimmed milk for 1 h at RT. Plates were then incubated with (1:100 diluted) sera from ovarian cancer patients and healthy donors for 2 h at RT and subsequently with an anti-human IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at RT. o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride was employed as a substrate and the colorimetric reaction was stopped with 5 N H2SO4. The mean + 2SD value of the antibody titer of healthy donors was used as a cut-off value, above which all samples were considered positive. The specificity of circulating antibodies was confirmed by immunoblotting, as previously described.10 In addition, neutralization experiments were performed by pre-incubating sera with 15 g/mL recombinant AKAP4 for 2 h at RT. Thereafter, neutralized sera were used for probing recombinant AKAP4 by immunoblotting, following standardized procedures.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed by using the SPSS 20.0 software. p values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.

Background: let-7d has been indicated to act as a tumor suppressor in various cancers. However, the function and molecular mechanism of let-7d in meningioma progression have not been elucidated. Materials and methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression levels of let-7d and AEG-1 mRNA in meningioma tissues and cell lines. The protein level of AEG-1 was measured by Western blot analysis. MTT assay, Transwell invasion assay and flow cytometry analysis were carried out to determine the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells, respectively. Target gene of let-7d was verified by luciferase reporter analysis. Results: let-7d expression was downregulated, and AEG-1 expression was upregulated in meningioma tumor tissues. let-7d overexpression suppressed proliferation and invasion and induced apoptosis in IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells. Moreover, AEG-1 was a direct target of let-7d. Restoration of AEG-1 expression reversed let-7d-mediated suppression of the proliferation and invasion and let-7d-induced apoptosis in IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells. Conclusion: let-7d repressed proliferation and invasion and promoted apoptosis of meningioma cells by targeting AEG-1. The present study provided a better understanding of the meningioma pathogenesis and a promising therapeutic target for meningioma patients. Keywords: let-7d, AEG-1, meningioma cells, therapeutic target

Introduction
With an incidence rate of 4.4/100,000 individuals, meningiomas are the common prevalent neoplasms of central nervous system and occupied ~30% of all intracranial tumors.1,2 According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, meningiomas have been divided into three grades, including benign (Grade I), atypical (Grade II) or anaplastic/malignant (Grade III).3 Owing to the invasion and recurrence of malignant meningioma, the estimated overall 10-year survival rate is only ~15%.4 Over the last few years, an increasing attention has been paid to the molecular genetics of meningiomas.5 Specific gene dysfunctions have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these tumors, including the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes or excessive expression of oncogenes.6 However, a thorough understanding of the molecular basis of this tumor remains far from being well established. Therefore, further efforts are urgently required to provide a foundation for potential gene therapies and individualized treatments for meningiomas.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of naturally occurring and highly conserved small noncoding RNAs with ~22 nucleotides in length, are able to interact with the

3 untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs based on sequence complementarity, leading to mRNA degradation or translation inhibition.7 Increasing evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs play a crucial role in the development and progression of multiple cancers by serving as oncogenes or as tumor suppressors.8 let-7 family members, highly conserved across diverse animal species, have been found to be low expressed in many cancer types.9,10 let-7d, a member of the let-7 family, has been described to be involved in the development and progression of leukemia,11 prostate cancer,12 ovarian cancer13 and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).14 Moreover, let-7d was reported to be downregulated in meningioma tumor tissues.15 However, the functional action and mechanism of let-7d in meningioma development and progression have not been elucidated.
Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1), known as metadherin (MDTH), was initially characterized as a neuropathologyrelated gene after HIV-1 infection or exposure to HIV envelope glycoprotein.16 Ample evidence revealed that AEG-1 functions as an oncogene by promoting cell proliferation, invasiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in many kinds of cancers, such as lung cancer,17 cervical cancer18 and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.19 Recently, a report showed that AEG-1 contributed to the malignant progression of meningiomas.20 However, how AEG-1 is regulated in meningiomas is still unclear.
In the present study, the function and action mechanism of let-7d in meningioma progression were investigated.
Materials and methods Tissue specimens
Seventeen meningioma samples (six WHO grade I, five WHO grade II and six WHO grade III) were obtained from resected tumor tissues during surgery, and seven normal arachnoidal samples were acquired from fresh autopsies. All tissue specimens were snap-frozen and maintained at -80°C for subsequent analysis. Ethic review committees of Xinxiang Central Hospital approved the experimental procedures. Informed consent form was signed by each patient.
Cell culture
Human meningioma cell lines IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN were obtained from Shanghai Institute of Cell Research (Shanghai, China). Human benign meningioma cell line BenMen1 was purchased from Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Human benign meningioma cell line HBL52 was provided by Cell Lines Service and Cellbank (Heidelberg, Germany). All cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific,

Waltham, MA, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C in humidified 5% CO2.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
Total RNAs were isolated from meningioma tissues and cell lines using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The expression of miRNA was quantified using TaqMan MicroRNA Assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and normalized to U6 snRNA expression. Relative levels of mRNA were measured with SYBR green qRT-PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and normalized to -actin expression. The primers for DNA amplification were as follows: let-7d, 5 ACACTCCAGCTGGGTGAGGTAGTAGATTGAATA 3 (forward) and 5AACTGGTGTCGTGGAG 3 (reverse); U6, 5 CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA 3 (forward) and 5 TGGTGTCGTGGAGTCG 3 (reverse); AEG-1, 5 TGCC TCCTTCACAGACCAA 3 (forward) and 5 TCGGC TGCAGATGAGATAG 3 (reverse) and -actin, 5 TGAGA GGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC 3 (forward) and 5 AAGAA GGAAGGCTGGAAAAGAG 3 (reverse).
The relative level of let-7d and AEG-1 was analyzed using the 2-Ct method.21
Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as previously described.22 All proteins were resolved on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, followed by incubating with primary antibodies anti-AEG-1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and anti--actin (Abcam). Protein bands were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
Cell transfection
pcDNA-AEG-1 plasmid was established by inserting the full-length sequence of AEG-1 into pcDNA vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To manipulate the expression of AEG-1 and let-7d, IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells were transfected with let-7d mimics (GenePharma, Shanghai, China), let-7d inhibitor (GenePharma) or pcDNA-AEG-1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Scramble RNA (miR-control) and pcDNA empty vector were used as negative controls.
Cell viability assay
The cell viability of IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN was assessed by MTT assay. Transfected cells were cultured for 48 h in 96-well plates and then incubated with 20 L MTT

(0.5 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, USA) for 4 h, followed by discarding of the culture supernatant and addition of 150 L of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; SigmaAldrich Co.). The absorbance at 450 nm was determined using a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices LLC, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Cell invasion assay
The invasion ability of IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells was determined by Transwell invasion assay. Transfected cells in DMEM serum-free medium were placed into the upper chamber coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). DMEM medium with 5% FBS was added to the lower chamber. After 48 h of incubation, cells passing through the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.5% crystal violet and counted using a microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The experiments were independently repeated three times.
Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was determined using Annexin V/FITC Apoptosis Detection kit (BD Biosciences). Briefly, IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells were cultured for 48 h after transfection. Then, the cells were stained by incubating with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) in the dark for 15 min. Finally, the data were acquired by FACSCanto II flow cytometer with BD FACSDiva software V6.1.3 (BD Biosciences).
Luciferase reporter assays
The wild-type 3 UTR of AEG-1 (AEG-1-wt) was chemically synthesized and cloned into the luciferase reporter vector PGL3 (Promega Corporation, Fitchburg, WI, USA). Mutant AEG-1 3 UTR (AEG-1-mut) construct was performed using QuickChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and introduced into pGL3 vector. Subsequently, IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells were co-transfected with miR-control or let-7d and wild- or mutant-type reporter plasmids (AEG-1-wt or AEG1-mut). Luciferase activities were measured using the DualLuciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega Corporation) at 48 h post transfection.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SD values for three independent experiments. Data were analyzed using SPSS 19.0 software (SPSS, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Statistical comparisons were assessed using Student's t-test or one-way

ANOVA. Differences were considered to be statistically significant when P,0.05.
Results let-7d expression is decreased and AEG-1 expression is elevated in meningiomas
To determine whether let-7d and AEG-1 were involved in meningioma carcinogenesis, the expression of let-7d and AEG-1 mRNA was first detected by qRT-PCR analysis in 17 meningioma tissue samples (six WHO grade I, five WHO grade II and six WHO grade III) and seven normal arachnoidal tissue samples. As shown in Figure 1A and B, let-7d expression was significantly downregulated and AEG-1 mRNA level was significantly upregulated in meningioma tissues when compared with that in non-neoplastic arachnoidal tissues. In addition, an inverse correlation between let-7d and AEG-1 expressions was observed in meningioma tissues (r=-0.6993, P=0.0018) (Figure 1C). Moreover, our results displayed that let-7d expression in atypical (WHO grade II) and anaplastic meningiomas (WHO grade III) was significantly lower than that in benign meningiomas (WHO grade I; Figure 1D). On the contrary, AEG-1 level increased with the ascending of pathological tumor grade (Figure 1E). Next, qRT-PCR analysis was performed to measure let-7d expression in four meningioma cell lines (IOMM-Lee, CH-157MN, BenMen1 and HBL52). Malignant cell lines (IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN) exhibited lower let-7d expression than BenMen1 and HBL52 cells derived from benign meningiomas (Figure 1F). Thus, IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells were used in the subsequent experiments. All these results suggested that dysregulated expression of let-7d and AEG-1 may be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of meningioma.
let-7d overexpression inhibits cell viability and invasion and induces apoptosis in meningioma cells
To investigate the functional role of let-7d in meningioma cells, gain-of-function experiments were performed in IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells by transfecting with miR-control or let-7d mimics. First, the transfection efficiency was validated with the fact that let-7d expression was significantly upregulated in IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells transfected with let-7d mimics (Figure 2A). Then, the effect of let-7d overexpression on the cell viability, invasive ability and apoptotic activity was determined by MTT, Transwell invasion assays and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The results of MTT assay indicated that let-7doverexpressing IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells displayed

(Figure 2C). Furthermore, the apoptotic rate of IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells was remarkedly elevated by let-7d mimics transfection (Figure 2D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that let-7d suppressed the development of meningioma.

let-7d targets AEG-1
Collecting evidence suggested that miRNAs play functional actions by suppressing their special target genes. Therefore, target prediction of let-7d was conducted by using online TargetScan software (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical

Research, Cambridge, MA, USA). As shown in Figure 3A, AEG-1 3 UTR contains a binding site of let-7d. To further verify that AEG-1 was a target gene of let-7d, dual luciferase reporter assay was performed. let-7d mimics remarkedly reduced the luciferase activity of AEG-1-wt

reporter in IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells; however, no significant change was observed in the luciferase activity of AEG-1-mut reporter between let-7d and miR-control groups (Figure 3B). To further confirm the actual effect of let-7d on AEG-1 expression, qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses were performed to detect the mRNA and protein level of AEG-1 in let-7d mimics- or inhibitor-transfected cells. The results indicated that ectopic expression of let-7d suppressed AEG-1 expression at miRNA and protein levels, while let-7d inhibition improved the AEG-1 level in IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells (Figure 3C and D). Collectively, these data implied that let-7d directly inhibited AEG-1 expression.
Upregulation of AEG-1 reverses the effects of let-7d overexpression on proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of meningioma cells
To further investigate whether let-7d exerted its antitumor effect in meningioma progression by targeting AEG-1, IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells were transfected with let-7d or co-transfected with let-7d and pcDNA-AEG-1. MTT assay revealed that the inhibitory effect of let-7d on the cell viability of IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells was eliminated after pcDNA-AEG-1 transfection (Figure 4A). Transwell invasion assay showed that exogenetic expression of AEG-1 expression abolished let-7d-mediated suppression on IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cell invasion (Figure 4B). Furthermore, overexpression of AEG-1 abrogated let-7d-induced apoptosis of IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells (Figure 4C). Taken together, the data confirmed that let-7d suppressed the tumorigenesis of meningioma by targeting AEG-1.
To further confirm the functional role of AEG-1 in meningioma, IOMM-Lee cells were transfected with pcDNAAEG-1 or pcDNA-control. First, the result of Western blot analysis indicated that AEG-1 was successfully overexpressed in pcDNA-AEG-1 transfecting IOMM-Lee cells (Figure 5A). Then, the cell viability, invasion and apoptosis were determined in IOMM-Lee cells. As expected, AEG-1 overexpression increased the viability and invasion of IOMM-Lee cells (Figure 5B and C). However, AEG-1 overexpression did not lead to significant decrease in IOMM-Lee cell apoptosis (Figure 5D), which may due to that the apoptotic rate in IOMM-Lee cells had reached the lowermost.
Discussion
Recently, increasing evidence suggested that dysregulation of miRNAs is involved in the oncogenesis of various

cancers, including meningioma. For example, Werner et al23 reported that miR-34a-3p was significantly downregulated in WHO grade II and III meningiomas, and miR-34a-3p overexpression suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of meningioma cells in vitro by directly targeting SMAD4, FRAT1 and BCL2. Overexpressed miR-200a inhibited meningioma cell migration and tumor growth by directly targeting non-muscle heavy chain IIb (NMHCIIb), playing key roles in cell division and cell migration.24 Another study revealed that high-expressed miR-21 expression and low-expressed miR-107 were closely associated with histopathological grade of meningiomas.25 miRNA-145 was found to be downregulated in meningioma, and elevated miR-145 expression in IOMM-Lee meningioma cells led to reduced proliferation, induced apoptosis and impaired migratory and invasive potential.15 Moreover, this study also revealed a significant downregulation of let-7d expression in meningioma tumor tissues.15 However, the function and mechanism of let-7d in meningioma development and progression are still unclear. Therefore, the present study mainly investigated the role of dysregulated let-7d in meningioma.
Accumulating documents pointed that let-7d was lowly expressed in several cancers and functions as a tumor suppressor.10 Low expression of let-7d was found in HNSCC patients and was predictive of poor survival.14 let-7d inhibited renal cell carcinoma growth, metastasis and tumor macrophage infiltration at least partially by downregulating COL3A1 and CCL7.26 let-7d was also implied to suppress EMT expression and chemoresistant ability in oral cancer.27 However, the role of let-7d in meningioma is still not illuminated. In the present study, we found that let-7d was lowly expressed in meningioma tissues and cells, and restoration of let-7d expression suppressed cell viability and invasion and induced apoptosis in meningioma cells. Our study first demonstrated that let-7d functioned as a tumor suppressor in meningioma progression, which may provide a novel therapeutic target for patients with meningioma.
Emerging evidence suggests the involvement of AEG-1 in many cancers. For example, AEG-1 knockdown led to the apoptosis induction in prostate cancer through activating forkhead box 3a (FOXO3a).28 Elevated AEG-1 expression was linked to progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and represented a poor prognosis in cervical cancer.29 In human retinoblastoma cells, downregulation of AEG-1 displayed a tumor suppressive effect by inhibiting growth and inducing apoptosis via MAPK pathways.30 In the present study, to investigate the functional role of AEG-1 in the progression

of meningioma, AEG-1 was knocked down in IOMM-Lee and CH-157MN cells. AEG-1 downregulation resulted in the inhibition of cell viability and invasive ability and the enhancement of apoptosis. A recent study revealed that knockdown of AEG-1 suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis and

blocked invasion in ovarian cancer cells,31 which was consistent with our findings. Moreover, AEG-1 was verified to be a target of let-7d. Restoration of AEG-1 expression counteracted the inhibitory effect of let-7d on the cell viability and invasion and let-7d-induced apoptosis in meningioma cells.

Conclusion
In summary, our study demonstrates that let-7d overexpression suppresses proliferation and invasion and induces apoptosis in meningioma cells. More importantly, the inhibitory effect of let-7d on meningioma progression is mediated by its functional target AEG-1. Altogether, our study suggests that let-7d may provide a novel therapy for meningioma patients in the future.

Background: Ras-related GTP-binding protein 43 (RAB43) plays a key part in the progression of many human cancers. However, the role and functional mechanisms of RAB43 in gastric cancer (GC) remain unknown. Purpose: To elucidate the function and mechanism of RAB43 in the progression of GC. Patients and Methods: One hundred patients with histologically confirmed GC were recruited for this study. Tumor samples and GC cell lines were used to detect RAB43 levels. Cell Counting Kit8 (CCK8) and colony formation assays were used to analyze cell proliferation. Cell migration and invasion ability were examined by wound healing and transwell assays. Western blot assays and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were performed to examine related mRNA and protein expression. In vivo experiments were used to examine the effect of RAB43. Results: Patients with RAB43-positive tumors had worse overall survival than patients with RAB43-negative tumors. Downregulation of RAB43 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and cell metastasis. In contrast, RAB43 overexpression promoted proliferation and metastasis in normal gastric epithelial GES-1 cells. In vivo studies confirmed that RAB43 promoted tumor growth. In addition, the knockdown of RAB43 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and metastasis via phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases/protein-serine-threonine kinase (PI3K/AKT) pathway. Conclusion: RAB43 promotes GC cells proliferation and migration in vivo and in vitro and probably served as a novel potential therapeutic biomarker for GC. Keywords: gastric cancer, RAB43, cell proliferation, metastasis, PI3K/AKT pathway

Introduction
As the fourth most common cancer and the second highest cause of cancer-related death worldwide, especially in East Asia, gastric cancer (GC) seriously threatens patients' lives.1,2 Surgical resection combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy has greatly decreased GC mortality; however, GC patient outcomes remain poor.3 Therefore, it is essential to identify effective early markers and explore novel therapeutic and diagnostic method to improve the survival rate of GC patients.
Ras-related GTP-binding protein 43 (RAB43) is a member of the Ras superfamily.4 Previous investigators showed that RAB43 associates with a variety of compartments within cells, including an early compartment of the Golgi, where it may be involved in regulating the association of pre-Golgi intermediates with microtubules.5 Recently, researchers have focused on its function in

cancer; for example, RAB43 participates in the regulation of multiple signal transduction pathways related to cell invasion, cell apoptosis and immune response.6 Li revealed that high RAB43 expression predicts poor prognosis and is related with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gliomas.7 However, the biological function and molecular mechanisms of RAB43 in GC are still explored. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the function and mechanism of RAB43 in GC. We found that RAB43 is upregulated in GC. In addition, the functions of RAB43 in promoting the metastasis and growth of GC, as well as the underlying mechanism related to its biological behavior, were investigated.
Materials and Methods GC Samples and Cell Lines
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xinhua Hospital (Approval No. XHEC-F-2019-044/ XHEC-D-2019-082), and all patients provided written informed consent, and this was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The GC tissue samples used were collected between 2011 and 2012 at the Department of General Surgery, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China. We collected GC samples from 100 patients with radical gastrectomy (without prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy). The paired adjacent nontumor tissues were more than 5 centimeters (cm) away from the tumor edge and were estimated to have no tumor invasion. All diagnoses of GC and lymph node metastasis were confirmed by histopathological examination, and adjacent control samples were confirmed to be free of tumor cells. All tissue samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen within 5 min immediately and were stored at -80 °C.
The human GC cell lines HGC27, MGC803, SGC7901, and MGC823 and the normal gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum. All cells were cultivated at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.

RNA Interference and Transfection
The strand sequence of human small interfering RNA (siRNA) of RAB43 is 5-CCATTGAGACGTCTGCCAA-3, and the negative control sequence was 5-TTCTCCGA ACGTGTCACGT-3. 5×105 cells/well were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with the relevant siRNA (50 nmol/well) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol.
RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was amplified by qRT-PCR with SYBR Green (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan). The expression of target genes was normalized to the expression of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
The following primers were used to detect the expression of RAB43 and GAPDH:
RAB43: 5- CTGCTGATCGGGAACAAGTCA -3 5- CAATGGCACACAGGATGTCATA -3 GAPDH: 5-GCCGCATCTTCTTTTGCGTCGC-3 5-TCCCGTTCTCAGCCTTGACGGT-3
Cell Viability Assay
Cell viability was evaluated using a CCK8 assay following the manufacturer's instructions. Human GC cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 103/well for different times. Optical density (OD) 450 values were analysed by spectrophotometry (BioTek, USA) 3 h after being incubated with 10 L of CCK8 reagent. All data were determined from three independent experiments.
Colony Formation Assay
A density of 500 cells/well of human GC cells were seeded into 6-well plates for approximately 2 weeks in RPMI-1640 medium. Then, the cells were cleaned and fixed with 10% formalin and stained with a 0.1% crystal violet solution (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). After staining, the plates were dried and observed under a microscope. The clones with more than 50 cells were numbered.

Plasmid Transfection
RAB43 and an empty vector (pcDNA 3.1) were purchased from Era Biotech (Shanghai, China). Cells were seeded on 6-well plates and transfected for 48 h using Viafect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Transwell Assays and Wound Healing Assays
Transwell assays were performed to analyse cell migration and invasion ability. 5x104 GC cell were suspensions in
200ul serum-free medium, and then were seeded onto the

upper chambers. In the lower chambers, we placed 500 µL of medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 24h, the cells were collected. The filters were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and stained with a 0.1% crystal violet solution for 15 min at 37°C.
GC cells were cultured in 6-well plates until 90% confluency. Then we inhibit cell division with mitomycin C (10 g/mL) at 37°C in a 5% (v/v) CO2 incubator for 1 h. Then we used a sterile 200-L pipet tip perpendicular to divided two wounds every plates. The cells were cleaned with PBS and incubated with 2 mL serum-free media. The cells were photographed at 0 h, 24h and 48 h using a microscope. All the experiments were performed three times.
Western Blot Analysis
Total protein was extracted using RIPA buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and PhosSTOP (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The total cell protein concentrations were measured with bicinchoninic acid assays (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. The lysates were separated in a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and incubated with antibodies against RAB43, Snail, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, vimentin, GAPDH, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, AKT and P-AKT (all from Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA) diluted at 1:1000.
Subcutaneous Xenograft
All animal treatments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Jiaotong University. Male nude mice (aged 4-6 weeks) were purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Sh-NC and sh-RAB43 cells were resuspended in phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The mice were injected subcutaneously with 5 × 105 cells in 200 µL PBS into their right flank regions. After about 2 weeks, mice were euthanized. For tissue morphology evaluation, hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed on sections of the embedded samples. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for RAB43 and Ki-67 was performed on sections from the xenograft tumors.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining was performed using a standard immunoperoxidase staining procedure, and the expression and score of RAB43 in the GC specimens was measured as Li described.8 The sections were scored according to the extent of immunoreactivity as follows: 0% immunoreactive cells were scored as 0; <5% immunoreactive cells were scored as 1; 5-50% immunoreactive cells were scored as 2; and >50% immunoreactive cells were scored as 3. Additionally, the staining intensity was scored as follows: 0, negative; 1, weak; 2, intermediate; and 3, strong. We defined the final immunoreaction score as the sum of extension and intensity, and the samples were classified as negative (0), weakly stained (1-2), moderately stained (3), and strongly stained (4-6). In the final statistics, we defined moderate and strong final immunoreaction scores as positive; the other final scores were considered negative.
Statistical Analysis
All experiments were performed at least 3 times, and the results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise stated. Student's t-test was used to compare the differences between the treatment groups and the corresponding control groups. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results RAB43 Is Highly Expressed in GC and Correlates with Poor Prognosis in GC Patients
To examine the potential effect of RAB43 in GC progression, we measured its expression in GC and adjacent control tissues by IHC (Figure 1A). As shown in Figure 1A and B, the GC tissues had relatively higher RAB43 expression than the normal tissues. In tumor samples, approximately 70.0% (70/100) of the GC cases had positive RAB43 staining. In contrast, only 31.0% (31/100) of the cases had positive staining in the adjacent samples. Our results demonstrated that the expression of RAB43 was higher in GC tissues than in the matched adjacent tissues (Figure 1C).
Due to high expression of RAB43 in GC, we hypothesized that high levels of RAB43 may predict poor survival in GC patients. Thus, we examined the correlation between RAB43 expression levels and histopathological parameters in GC patients. As we can see in Table 1, RAB43 overexpression was significantly correlated with TNM stage (P<0.001), while RAB43 overexpression was not corrected

with sex, age, histopathological subtype and tumor location. A subsequent multivariate Cox analysis (Table 2 and Figure 1D) showed that high RAB43 expression was an independent prognostic factor for poor survival in GC patients. The results confirmed that RAB43 expression predicted a postoperative survival, suggesting that high RAB43 expression is a independent risk factor of GC.
RAB43 Downregulation Attenuates GC Cell Proliferation and Metastasis in vivo and in vitro
To verify the oncogenic activity of RAB43 in GC, we first examined its expression in GC cells. As Figure 2A and B shows, RAB43 expression is higher in GC cells than in normal epithelial GES-1 cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. Next, we knocked down RAB43 expression in MGC803 and HGC27 cell lines using retroviral transduction and then assessed cell proliferation (Figure 2C). As shown in Figure 2D, knockdown of RAB43 significantly reduced the number of colonies by colony formation assay. Next, we explored the role of

RAB43 on GC cell proliferation in vivo. As the results shown in Figure 2E, the tumor volume and weight of RAB43-depleted mice were obviously inhibited compared with the control group. Moreover, IHC analysis revealed that RAB43 and Ki67 levels were substantially decreased in the shRAB43 group (Figure 2F). The above results indicated that RAB43 promotes cell growth in vitro and in vivo.
Furthermore, we investigated the invasion and migration ability of GC cells to understand the molecular basis of RAB43-regulated cancer metastasis. As shown in Figure 3A and B, the invasion and migration ability of shRAB43 cells were significantly reduced according to transwell experiments. Consistent with the above results, wound healing assays revealed that RAB43 knockdown in GC cells moderately decreased the migration rate (Figure 3C). Thus, we believe that RAB43 regulates GC cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo.
RAB43 Overexpression Promotes Proliferation and Metastasis in GES-1 Cells
As normal gastric mucosal epithelial GES-1 cells have weaker expression of RAB43, we overexpressed RAB43

in GES-1 cells to further confirm the role of RAB43 on GC progression. As shown in Figure 4A, the proliferation of RAB43-overexpression group was obviously increased than the control group. Moreover, RAB43 overexpression increased colony formation than control group

in GES-1 cells (Figure 4B). Additionally, the RAB43overexpression cells showed stronger invasive and migratory capacities than the control cells (Figure 4C and D). Above all, we concluded that high expression of RAB43 could induce increased proliferation, migration and invasion ability of normal gastric mucosal epithelial GES-1 cells.
RAB43 Was Involved in PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway in GC Cells
We measured the regulatory pathways related to tumor metastasis and growth to illuminate the molecular mechanisms of RAB43 regulating GC cell metastasis and growth. As shown in Figure 5A, RAB43 knockdown dramatically increased the expression of E-cadherin and decreased the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin, which play important roles in cell metastasis.
In previous studies, researchers reported that PI3K/ AKT pathway was a major signaling pathway associated with cancer progression and invasion.9,10 Thus, we next examined the expression of PI3K/AKT signaling related molecules. As shown in Figure 5B, the expression of AKT, p-AKT, and PI3K in GC cells was lower in the shRAB43 group than in the control group (Figure 5B). All these results demonstrated that RAB43 was involved in PI3K/ AKT pathway in GC cells.

Discussion
The function of RAB43, a member of the Ras-related small
GTPase superfamily, is poorly characterized compared with that of many other secretory RAB GTPases.4 RAB43 localizes

at the Golgi and is important for maintaining Golgi structure and function and transporting Shiga toxin from the cell surface to the trans-Golgi network.11-13 Moreover, RAB43 interacts directly with G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) in an

activation-dependent pattern. The RAB43-binding domain identified in the receptors effectively converts nonGPCR membrane protein transport into a RAB43-dependent pathway.14 Recently, researchers focused on the RAB43's anti-cancer effects. High expression of RAB43 predicts poor prognosis and is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gliomas.7 However, the effect and mechanism of RAB43 on gastric cancer is still unrevealed.
In our study, we found that the expression of RAB43 was significantly upregulated in GC tissues compared with adjacent control samples. We also found that high expression of RAB43 predicted poor prognosis of GC patients. Increased RAB43 protein expression correlated with poor patient survival, suggesting that RAB43 is a prospective biomarker for GC diagnosis and therapy, although more work still needed further verification.
Additionally, the effect of RAB43 on the biological behavior of GC cells was explored. Decreased migration, invasion, and proliferation were observed in RAB43 knockdown cells both in vitro and in vivo. The proliferation and viability of shRAB4 group was measured by CCK8 and in GC cells. The results demonstrated that knockdown of RAB43 significantly reduced GC cell proliferation. In vivo, compared with those of tumors from the control group, the volumes and weights of tumors from lv-shRAB43 group were significantly decreased. We further studied the effects of RAB43 on GC cell

metastasis. Moreover, the invasion and migration ability of the shRAB43 group was sharply reduced than in control group according to transwell study. In contrast, RAB43 overexpression promoted proliferation and metastasis in normal gastric epithelial GES-1 cells. These results were further confirmed by enhanced expression of E-cadherin and reduced expression of vimentin and N-cadherin, key metastasis-related factors. All these results might explain the RAB43-associated aggressive biological behaviors of GC.
Recently, more and more studies have shown that various signaling pathways are involved in the progression of GC.15 PI3K/AKT is a common signaling pathway downregulated in human cancers.16 PI3K/AKT has extremely important biological functions in cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, autophagy, and other processes in GC.17 For example, Linc00152 promotes GC growth through activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent PI3K/AKT pathway;18 microRNA-28 promotes cell proliferation and invasion in GC via the gene of phosphate and tension homology deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway;19 and the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis promotes GC invasion via PI3K/AKT pathway-dependent MMP production.20 In present study, the expression of AKT, p-AKT, and PI3K in shRAB43 cells were reduced compared with the control group. These results suggested that

RAB43 regulated PI3K/AKT signaling in GC cells. Unfortunately, the direct link between RAB43 and this potential downstream pathway remains elusive.

In conclusion, our present study demonstrated that RAB43 is overexpressed in GC tissues and that high expression of RAB43 is associated with poor prognostic

In addition, we revealed that knockdown of RAB43 inhibited GC cell proliferation and migration via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Thus, RAB43 may served as a novel potential therapeutic biomarker for GC.

ObjectiveaaThis study investigated gender-specific incidence and predictors of cognitive impairment among community-dwelling older adults in South Korea.

MethodsaaUsing data from the 2006 and 2012 Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing (KLoSA), 925 females and 834 males aged 65 and over without cognitive impairment at 2006 were analyzed separately. Cognitive impairment was measured based on the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Exam (K-MMSE) normative score. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) was conducted to examine the predictors of cognitive impairment at 6-year follow up.

ResultsaaIncidence of cognitive impairment at 2012 was significantly higher for women (30.5%) than men (26.1%). GEE result showed that depression was significantly associated with cognitive impairment for both genders (female: OR=2.26, 95% CI=1.63-3.12; male: OR=3.26, 95% CI=2.19-4.83). Having IADL limitations (OR=1.15, 95% CI=1.03-1.28), high blood pressure (OR=1.72, 95% CI=1.27- 2.34), poor hearing (OR=1.94, 95% CI=1.29-2.92), regular exercise (OR=0.67, 95% CI=0.45-0.99), and normal weight (OR=1.39, 95% CI=1.03-1.86) were significant predictors of cognitive impairment only among women. In contrast, age (OR=1.04, 95% CI=1.01-1.07) and ADL limitations (OR=1.48, 95% CI=1.21-1.82) were significant predictors of cognitive impairment at follow-up only among men.

ConclusionaaFindings of this study show gender-specific predictors of cognitive impairment among older Koreans. This study can pro-

vide information for clinicians and policy makers to develop different intervention strategies considering gender differences in the prog-

ress of cognitive impairment.

INTRODUCTION
With a rapid growth in the older population, geriatric health problems become important concerns worldwide. Cognitive impairment is a major geriatric health problem among older adults because cognitive decline increases with age. Although cognitive decline is a normal aging process, many people concern about cognitive impairment because people with mild cognitive impairment have a high risk of eventually progress-

ing to Alzheimer's disease.1 According to the Korea Ministry of Health and Welfare,2 about 0.5 million older Koreans suffered from dementia in 2012, and the number of older Koreans suffering from dementia is expected to increase up to 2.7 million by 2050. Since dementia is a risk factor for mortality3 and involves high health care costs,4 it is not surprising that there is a growing interest in cognitive health.
In Korea, cognitive impairment and dementia are more prevalent among women than men.5,6 The number of older adults aged 65 and over diagnosed with dementia in 2012 was about 0.16 million for men and 0.38 million for women, respectively.2 Since women outlive men, this statistics may not be surprising. However, many studies reported that being a woman is a risk factor for cognitive impairment.7 Gender differences in work and family roles may explain mental health disparities by gender.8 Since women have lower education, lower wages, and less social benefits than men, disadvantages

Gender-Specific Predictors of Cognitive Impairment
in socioeconomic structure could lead to gender differences in the prevalence of cognitive impairment.
Previous studies have identified several socio-demographic factors, health factors, and health behaviors as predictors of variability in cognition in later life. Among the socio-demographic factors, older age,9 not cohabiting with a partner,10 lower education,11 lower income,9 and living in a rural area12 were associated with poor cognitive functioning. In terms of health factors, having poor self-rated health,13 having ADL or IADL limitations,9 having chronic illnesses,14 being sensory impaired,15 and being depressed16 were all risk factors for declines in cognitive functioning. Health behaviors have also been taken into account. Current smokers reported poor cognitive functioning,17 while normal drinkers,18 people who regularly exercise,19 people with normal weight,9 and people who participate in social activities20 reported good cognitive functioning.
When the magnitude of gender differences regarding above health characteristics determinants were taken into account, structural and psychosocial factors were more important for women, while behavioral factors were more important for men.21 Therefore, predictors of cognitive impairment may be different by gender. However, studies identifying gender-specific risk factors for cognitive impairment are rare, and if gender-specific models were examined, most studies were conducted in a cross-sectional design.7,22 Since longitudinal studies examining predictors of cognitive impairment are few, it is not clear which gender-specific factors have causal relationships with cognitive impairment. Therefore, this study attempts to fill this gap and examine the gender-specific incidence and predictors of cognitive impairment, using a nationally representative sample of older Koreans from 2006 to 2012.
METHODS
Study sample Data for this study came from the 2006 and 2012 waves of
the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing (KLoSA), a nationally representative longitudinal survey including community-dwelling middle and old-aged population who are aged 45 and over. The sampling framework was based on the probability proportional to size (PPS) systematic sampling of the 2005 Korean Census and Housing Enumeration Districts (ED), stratified by 15 metropolitan areas and provinces, urban/rural regions, and apartment building/non-apartment dwelling. Age-eligible households were selected within each ED. Using a multistage stratified probability sampling based on geographical areas, respondents in individual households were interviewed using computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) methods. The KLoSA survey includes questionnaires on demographics, family, health, employment, income,
474 Psychiatry Investig 2016;13(5):473-479

assets, and subjective expectations and satisfaction.23 The first KLoSA survey was conducted in 2006, with 10,254 respondents among 6,171 households. In 2008, 8,688 respondents were followed-up. In the 2010 third wave, 7,920 respondents were followed-up. The fourth wave in 2012 comprised 7,486 respondents, representing 73.0% of the original panel.
In this study, the sample was restricted to older adults aged 65 and over at baseline who completed both 2006 and 2012 interviews, and were not cognitively impaired at baseline. Cognitive impairment was defined based on the cut-off scores (2 standard deviation of the mean) from the K-MMSE normative data (see also Measures section). Among 7,486 respondents who completed both 2006 and 2012 interviews, 4,686 respondents under age 65 were excluded. Among 2,800 respondents who met the age criteria, 805 respondents who were cognitively impaired at baseline were excluded from the sample. Among 1,995 respondents who met sample criteria, a pool of 1,759 subjects remained eligible for empirical analysis after listwise deletion of cases with missing values. The sample was subdivided into female and male groups, which consisted of 925 and 834 subjects, respectively.
Measures
Cognitive impairment The measure of cognitive impairment was assessed with the
Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (KMMSE) that had a maximum score of 30 points.24 Both validity and reliability of K-MMSE instrument were established (Cronbach's alpha: 0.880).24 K-MMSE is widely used for screening of cognitive impairment among older adults,24 and the normative data for K-MMSE has been developed for clinical use.25 Based on age, gender, and educational strata, the cutoff scores (2 standard deviation of the mean) from the KMMSE normative data were used to determine cognitive impairment.25 In this study, cognitive impairment measured at baseline was used for sample criteria, and cognitive impairment measured at follow-up was used as a dependent variable. Cognitive function (K-MMSE score) at baseline was also used as a covariate to predict cognitive impairment at follow-up.
Socio-demographic factors In this study, age (in years), marital status (1=married,
0=others), a set of dichotomous variables of education (less than middle school (reference group), middle school graduate, high school graduate, and some college or more), household income (in quartiles), and region (1=living in a major city, 0=others) were included as pre-existing socio-demographic factors. Household income was measured from the

imputed dataset.26 All socio-demographic factors were measured at baseline.
Health factors Self-rated health was assessed with a 5-point likert scale,
then dichotomized (1=fair/poor health, 0=good/very good/ excellent health). Functional difficulty was measured with the number of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) limitations.27 ADL items included having difficulty in dressing, washing face and hands, bathing, eating, transfer, toileting, and continence.28 IADL items included having difficulty in decorating, housework, preparing meals, laundry, outgoing for a short distance, using transportation, shopping, handling money, using telephone, and taking medicine.29 Each ADL and IADL item was dichotomized (1=need any help, 0=otherwise), then the sum scores of ADLs and IADLs were constructed. ADLs ranged from 0 to 7, and IADLs ranged from 0 to 10. Both validity and reliability of ADL and IADL instruments were established (Cronbach's alpha: 0.949 for ADL and 0.938 for IADL).28,29 Several physician-diagnosed chronic conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes, lung disease, liver disease, heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease) were measured, and each chronic condition was dichotomized (1=ever been diagnosed by a doctor, 0=otherwise). Based on the self-reported status of eyesight and hearing, poor eyesight was dichotomized (1=having fair/poor eyesight, 0=otherwise). Similarly, poor hearing was dichotomized (1=having fair/poor hearing, 0=otherwise). Depression was measured by using Korean version of the short-form (10-item) Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale.30,31 Both validity and reliability of CES-D instrument were established30 (Cronbach's alpha: 0.796). The respondents were asked whether they had depressive symptoms during the past week. Each item was coded as 1 if the respondent had depressive symptoms more than three days. Two positive items were coded reversely. Respondents with more than 4 depressive symptoms were considered as being depressed.31,32 All health factors were measured at baseline.
Health behaviors Smoking status was dichotomized (1=current smoking,
0=otherwise). Drinking status was dichotomized based on the respondents' drinking behavior (1=normal drinking, 0=otherwise).18 In the KLoSA, the CAGE questions (cutting down, annoyance by criticism, guilty feeling, and eye-openers) were used to identify the respondent's drinking behavior. If the current drinker answered "yes" to one or none of the four CAGE questions, the respondent was considered to have normal drinking behavior.33 Physical activity was dichotomized (1=

regular exercise, 0=otherwise). Body mass index (BMI) was dichotomized (1=normal weight, 0=otherwise) based on the definition from World Health Organization.34 Number of social participation ranged from 0 to 7, including attending religious meeting, social clubs, leisure group, alumni society, volunteer groups, political party, and others. All health behaviors were measured at baseline.
Statistical analysis In this study, analyses were conducted separately for fe-
males and males. For the descriptive analyses, means (M) and standard deviation (SD) were used to assess the sample characteristics. t-tests and chi-square tests were conducted to evaluate the gender differences in descriptive statistics. Then the generalized estimating equations model (GEE) was used to investigate predictors of cognitive impairment, accounting for autocorrelation issue. Due to the complexity of sampling design, all statistical analyses were conducted based on the weighted data using SPSS version 19 (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics Table 1 contains descriptive statistics for the study sample.
The incidence of cognitive impairment at 2012 was higher among women than men (female: 30.5%, male: 26.1%; p=0.010). In comparison, 35.0% of women and 20.0% of men were cognitively impaired at baseline. About 53.5% of women were married, while 92.5% of men were married. Compared to women, men were more educated, had higher household income, had better self-rated health, had less high blood pressure, had more lung disease, had less poor eyesight, were less depressed, and were more engaged in health behaviors.
Generalized estimating equations result Table 2 contains the empirical result of a generalized esti-
mating equations (GEE) model that describes predictors of cognitive impairment at follow-up. For both gender groups, depression was a significant predictor of cognitive impairment at follow-up controlling for other covariates (female: OR=2.26, p<0.001; male: OR=3.26, p<0.001). Among women, having IADL limitations (OR=1.15, p=0.015), high blood pressure (OR=1.72, p<0.001), poor hearing (OR=1.94, p=0.001), regular exercise (OR=0.67, p=0.042), and normal weight (OR=1.39, p=0.030) were significantly associated with cognitive impairment at follow-up. In contrast, age (OR=1.04, p=0.023) and ADL limitations (OR=1.48, p<0.001) were significant predictors of cognitive impairment at follow-up only among men.

Gender-Specific Predictors of Cognitive Impairment

DISCUSSION
This study was designed to examine the gender-specific incidence and predictors of cognitive impairment among older adults in Korea. Women had significantly higher incidence of cognitive impairment than men. Corresponding to previous studies, depression was a strong predictor for cognitive impairment in both female and male groups.16 However, several risk factors had different impacts on cognitive impairment

by gender. Among women, IADL limitations, high blood pressure, poor hearing, regular exercise, and normal weight were significantly associated with cognitive impairment. In contrast, age and ADL limitations were significantly associated with cognitive impairment only among men.
In this study, several factors were unique predictors of cognitive impairment only among women. First, more IADL limitation was significantly associated with cognitive impairment. Since some of the IADL functions (housework, shop-

Therefore, the impact of IADL limitation on cognitive impairment may be apparent among women. Second, high blood pressure was found to be a risk factor for cognitive impairment among older women in Korea. Previous studies of-

ten reported that high blood pressure is a risk factor for cognitive impairment.35 Moreover, studies showed that blood pressure levels increase in women after menopause.36 In other words, loss of estrogen with menopause may be related to the elevated blood pressure level among postmenopausal women.

Gender-Specific Predictors of Cognitive Impairment
files could explain why older women with high blood pressure were more likely to be cognitively impaired.36 Third, this study finding suggests that older women with poor hearing were more likely to be cognitively impaired. Since older adults with hearing impairments can have communication problems,37 their social network can become limited. In addition, psychosocial factors such as social ties and social support play more important role on cognitive health among women than among men.21 Therefore, poor hearing can be a significant risk factor for cognitive impairment among women. Fourth, regular exercise was found to be a protective factor for cognitive impairment. Women tend to have more vascular risk factors (ex. stress, abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, and high total cholesterol), and the beneficial effect of exercise on both dementia and vascular disease has been well reviewed.38 Therefore, exercise can be effective on cognitive health among women. Fifth, normal weight was found to be a risk factor for cognitive impairment among older women in Korea. Often, Korean women with normal weights have abdominal obesity, which is a serious risk factor for cognitive impairment. Since the effect of BMI on cognition is inconclusive, using different measures such as waist-hip ratio or waist circumference may explain this unexpected finding.
On the contrary, several risk factors for cognitive impairment were found only among men. First, age was a significant risk factor for cognitive impairment only among men. This is unexpected finding because age has been consistently found to be a strong risk factor for cognitive impairment for both genders. Among women in our study sample, age-related health changes between 6 years had significant impact on cognitive impairment. Therefore, the unique effect of age itself may have not been apparent. Second, more ADL limitation was significantly associated with cognitive impairment among men. In Korean culture, older men get more assistance when they have limitations in basic activities, which make them feel helpless. Since negative mood worsens cognitive activities,39 ADL limitations may accelerate cognitive impairment among Korean men.
There are some limitations in this study that should be noted. First, cognitive impairment was defined using a screening tool. Therefore, cognitive impairment prevalence may be higher than those actually diagnosed. Second, as with any secondary data analysis, several biological risk factors (e.g., APOE-e4 genotype, metabolic syndromes, etc.) could not be analyzed in this study. Since biological risk factors highly predict the cognitive impairment and dementia,40 clinical studies including these measures are recommended.
Although we had several limitations in our study, this study makes a number of important contributions. First, this study investigated the relationship between risk factors and cogni-
478 Psychiatry Investig 2016;13(5):473-479

tive impairment among Korean older adults using a nationally representative sample. Therefore, the findings from this study can be generalized. Second, this study examined gender differences, which could establish gender-specific strategies for the prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment among older adults in Korea. Third, this is a longitudinal study evaluating predictors of cognitive impairment in a 6-year period. Therefore, the results of this study can suggest causal relationships.
To conclude, this study holds significance as it investigated the gender-specific incidence and predictors of cognitive impairment among older Koreans using nationally representative sample. Development of cognitive impairment was greater in older women, and gender specific risk factors for cognitive impairment were observed among older Koreans. This study suggests that clinicians and policy makers may need to consider gender in the progression of cognitive impairment. Further study is needed to examine the detailed causal relations between each gender specific risk factor and cognitive impairment.

Abstract
Purpose. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and hyaluronic acid (HA) in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Methods. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of PRP and HA in KOA patients were retrieved from each database from the establishment date to April 2018. Outcome measurements were the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), visual analog scale (VAS), International Knee Documentation Committee, and Lequesne Index scores and adverse events. The pooled data were evaluated with Review Manager 5.3.5. Results. Fifteen RCTs (N ¼ 1,314) were included in our meta-analysis. The present meta-analysis indicated that PRP injections reduced pain more effectively than HA injections in patients with KOA at six and 12 months of follow-up, as evaluated by the WOMAC pain score; the VAS pain score showed a significant difference at 12 months. Moreover, better functional improvement was observed in the PRP group, as demonstrated by the WOMAC function score at three, six, and 12 months. Additionally, PRP injections did not display different adverse event rates compared with HA injections. Conclusion. In terms of long-term pain relief and functional improvement, PRP injections might be more effective than HA injections as a treatment for KOA. The optimal dosage, the timing interval and frequency of injections, and the ideal treatment for different stages of KOA remain areas of concern for future investigations.

Introduction
Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a progressive joint disease that often involves intra- and periarticular structures [1] and is considered pathology characterized by articular cartilage lesions, synovitis, subchondral sclerosis,

and osteophytes [2]. In addition, KOA is one of the most common causes of joint pain and loss of motor function among middle-aged and elderly people in the United States [3,4]. Despite advances in medical technology, no drug or surgical intervention is currently

available for delaying the development of KOA [5]. Oral anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy, topical anti-inflammatory gels, and intra-articular injections are currently routine treatments for patients with symptomatic KOA [5,6]. Nonsurgical treatments, such as exercise and weight loss, are recommended because surgical treatment may lead to increased symptoms and poor functional outcomes [7]. However, compliance with nonsurgical treatment is lower in KOA, and medications, such as simple analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are often associated with adverse events [8,9]. Many studies have reported that hyaluronic acid (HA) has visco-induction properties and can increase intra-articular lubrication; therefore, intraarticular HA injection is widely used to treat KOA [10]. However, although intra-articular drug therapy is often associated with reduced pain and increased joint function in patients, it is not effective in patients with KOA [11].
In the past decade, the use of autologous growth factors to treat knee osteoarthritis, such as intraarticular injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), has received increasing attention [12]. Recent studies have demonstrated that growth factors and other cytokines released by platelets during injury can modulate the inflammatory process and help maintain or regenerate tissue structure [13,14]. The subchondral bone contributes to the cartilage repair process and KOA. PRP is an autologous blood product containing a high concentration of platelets, and it has become an emerging treatment for ligament, tendon, cartilage, and bone injuries in orthopedics and sports medicine [15-18]. The intra-articular injection of PRP as a minimally invasive treatment has been widely used in the treatment of clinically related diseases. Sanchez et al. [19] reported that a new technique for the delivery of PRP is intraosseous infiltration combined with intraarticular injections to treat severe KOA; moreover, no adverse reactions occurred in their study. Many clinical studies have reported good clinical efficacy of PRP injections [20-22], and some previously published systematic reviews and meta-analyses have also suggested that PRP is a safe and effective orthopedic treatment compared with other intra-articular injections [23-27]. However, these reviews did not reach a consensus in terms of the effects of PRP on pain relief and functional recovery and concluded that more high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are still needed. Previous reviews either included non-RCTs or only analyzed a small number of RCTs (<10), and additional randomized trials have since been published. Therefore, further systematic reviews and meta-analyses are needed to fully investigate the effects of PRP on knee pain relief and functional improvement. Our aim is to identify all prospective RCTs published to date to provide up-todate insights into the efficacy of PRP in the treatment of KOA.

Methods
According to the PRISMA criteria, we created a prospective protocol including search strategies, selection criteria, outcome measurements, and methods of statistical analysis before commencing the study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. This review is registered in PROSPERO: CRD42018108825.
Search Strategy A comprehensive search of the PubMed (1966-April 2018), EMBASE (1980-April 2018), and Cochrane library (1966-April 2018) databases was conducted. The search terms included "platelet-rich plasma," "PRP," "knee," "osteoarthritis," "arthritis," and "arthritic." No language exclusions were applied. Manual searches were performed on the references of the identified studies.
Selection Criteria The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) RCTs comparing PRP with HA as a treatment for patients with KOA and 2) data that include at least one key outcome indicator, including the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), International Knee Documentation Committee (IDKC), visual analog scale (VAS), Lequesne Index, or adverse events.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) retrospective studies, cohort studies, or nonrandomized studies; 2) case reports, letters, editorials, and animal experimental studies; and 3) inability to extract relevant data from the included studies.
Data Extraction Two authors (YHH and HTH) independently extracted relevant data from the included studies, including authors' names, publication date, patient age and gender, patient body mass index (BMI), sample size, radiographic classification, follow-up period, details of PRP treatment protocols and controls, and related clinical results. In the event that data were missing, we obtained detailed information by contacting the appropriate author.
Quality Assessment Two authors (YHH and JKP) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration Tool for assessing the risk of bias (ROB). Each included study was scored as having a high, low, or unclear ROB according to the following evaluation criteria: 1) random sequence generation, 2) allocation concealment, 3) blinding of participants and personnel, 4) blinding of outcome assessments, 5) incomplete outcome data, 6) selective reporting, and 7) other sources of bias. Any discrepancies between the reviewers' findings were arbitrated by the appropriate senior experts.

Statistical Analysis Review Manager 5.3.5 software (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) was used for all analyses. Continuous data for the meta-analysis were calculated and are expressed as the mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and dichotomous data for the meta-analysis are presented as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. Heterogeneity between studies was estimated with the I2 test. If the heterogeneity was at an I2 value of 75% or higher, a random-effects model was used; otherwise, a fixed-effects model was used. P values <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance in all the results.
Ethical Approval This article does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

Results
Search Results Figure 1 shows the flow diagram of study selection. A total of 586 records were identified after the initial literature search. Of these, 296 records were excluded after a thorough screen of the titles and abstracts. Ultimately, the remaining 51 studies were assessed by performing a full-text review, and 15 RCTs [2,21,22,28-39] were included in the meta-analysis.
Study Characteristics Table 1 shows the characteristics of the included studies. The sample sizes of the studies ranged from 10 to 94, with a total of 1314 individuals; 643 individuals were included in the HA group and 671 individuals in the PRP group. One of the studies [28] had a total follow-up period of three months, seven studies [29,30,34,35,37-39] had follow-up periods of six months, six studies [21,22,31-33,36] had follow-up periods of 12 months, and only one study [2] had a follow-up period of 18 months. With the exception of one study [37], all studies used the Kellgren and Lawrence grading scales to classify the severity of KOA. The patients in most studies had KOA with a severity of class II or III. The demographic characteristics between the two groups in each of the included studies were similar.
The preparation and administration of PRP varied among these studies. Table 2 shows the details of PRP preparation and administration protocols specific to each included study, such as the PRP category, the use of exogenous activators, and the injection regimen, including the doses, times, and intervals.
Assessment of the ROB The summary of the ROB assessment of all included studies is illustrated in Figure 2. Adequate randomized sequences were generated in 13 studies [2,19,22,28,

31-39]. However, two studies [29,30] referred to random assignments but did not report the details of these random assignments. Appropriate allocation concealment was reported in eight studies [21,22,28,31,33,34,37,39], the blinding of participants and personnel was clear in nine studies [21,22,28,31,33,34,37-39], and the blinding of outcome assessors was reported in eight studies [21,22,33-35,37-39]. Incomplete outcome data were not observed in all included studies. In addition, no selective reporting or other obvious sources of bias were identified in these studies.
Outcomes of the Meta-analysis
WOMAC Pain Score WOMAC pain scores were reported by three [2,31,32], four [2,31,32,39], six [2,21,31,32,37,38], and five studies [2,21,31,32,36] at one, three, six, and 12 months, respectively. The pooled analysis did not reveal significant differences between the PRP and HA groups at one (MD ¼ À0.19, 95% CI ¼ À0.65 to 0.27, I2 ¼ 67%, P ¼ 0.42) and three months (MD ¼ À0.31, 95% CI ¼ À1.16 to 0.54, I2 ¼ 88%, P ¼ 0.47). However, subjects in the PRP group experienced significantly more pain relief than those in the HA group at six (MD ¼ À1.24, 95% CI ¼ -1.94 to À0.53, I2 ¼ 83%, P ¼ 0.0006) and 12 months

WOMAC Stiffness Score
WOMAC stiffness scores were reported by two [2,32],
three [2,32,39], five [2,21,32,37,38], and four studies [2,21,32,36] at one, three, six, and 12 months, respectively.
The pooled analysis did not reveal significant differences
between the PRP and HA groups at one (MD ¼ À0.13, 95% CI ¼ À0.41 to 0.15, I2 ¼ 35%, P ¼ 0.37) and six months (MD ¼ À0.46, 95% CI ¼ À0.92 to 0.01, I2 ¼ 60%, P ¼ 0.05). However, the subjects in the PRP group experienced significantly greater improvement in knee stiff-
ness than those in the HA group at three (MD ¼ -0.35, 95% CI ¼ À0.63 to À0.08, I2 ¼ 0%, P ¼ 0.01) and

WOMAC Function Score
WOMAC function scores were reported by two [2,32], three [2,32,39], five [2,21,32,37,38], and four studies [2,21,32,36] at one, three, six, and 12 months, respectively. The pooled analysis showed that the subjects in the PRP and HA groups exhibited similar functional recovery after one month (MD ¼ À2.35, 95% CI ¼ À5.28 to 0.57, I2 ¼ 59%, P ¼ 0.12) of treatment. However, the subjects in the PRP group performed better than those in the HA group at three (MD ¼ À1.92, 95% CI ¼ À2.57 to À1.27, I2 ¼ 0%, P < 0.000001), six (MD ¼ À3.71, 95% CI ¼ À7.21 to À0.22, I2 ¼ 84%, P ¼ 0.04), and

VAS VAS scores for pain were reported by three [28,32], four [2,28,32,39], four [2,31,32,38], and three studies [2,31,32] at one, three, six, and 12 months, respectively. Therefore, a subgroup meta-analysis was performed to compare the VAS scores for pain based on the length of follow-up. No significant differences were observed between the PRP and HA groups at one (MD ¼ 0.01, 95% CI ¼ À0.13 to 0.15, I2 ¼ 0%, P ¼ 0.89), three (MD ¼ À0.20, 95% CI ¼ À0.64 to 0.24, I2 ¼ 58%, P ¼ 0.38), and six months (MD ¼ À3.62, 95% CI ¼ À7.49 to 0.26, I2 ¼ 99%, P ¼ 0.07). However, the treatment in the PRP groups exhibited better efficacy than that in the HA groups at 12 months (MD ¼ À4.95, 95% CI ¼ À7.83 to À2.06, I2 ¼ 99%, P ¼ 0.0008) (Figure 3).

IDKC IDKC scores were reported by two [22,33], five [22,29,31,33,34], and three studies [22,31,33] at two, six, and 12 months, respectively. Therefore, a subgroup meta-analysis was performed to compare the IDKC scores based on the length of follow-up. No significant differences were observed between the PRP and HA groups at two (MD ¼ 0.29, 95% CI ¼ À3.44 to 4.02, I2 ¼ 0%, P ¼ 0.88) and 12 months (MD ¼ 5.84, 95% CI ¼ À1.05 to 12.72, I2 ¼ 87%, P ¼ 0.10). However, the subjects in the PRP group had significantly better IDKC scores than those in the HA group at six months (MD ¼ 8.02, 95% CI ¼ 4.13 to 11.91, I2 ¼ 77%, P < 0.0001) (Figure 4).
Lequesne Index Lequesne Index scores were reported by three studies [21,29,37], with 142 patients treated with PRP and 131 with HA. The pooled analysis did not reveal a significant difference between the PRP and HA groups at six months (MD ¼ À1.31, 95% CI ¼ À3.50 to 0.89, I2 ¼ 90%, P ¼ 0.24) (Figure 5).

Adverse Events Adverse events were reported by nine studies [2,21,28- 30,35,37-39], with 323 patients treated with PRP and 314 with HA. The pooled analysis did not detect a significant difference between the PRP and HA groups (RR ¼ 1.20, 95% CI ¼ 0.91 to 1.58, I2 ¼ 13%, P ¼ 0.20) (Figure 6).
Discussion As a common degenerative joint disease, KOA is the second leading cause of loss of joint function [4], which causes enormous economic and social burdens worldwide [40]. The understanding of KOA in terms of etiology and pathogenesis remains unclear [41]; the main pathological changes involve components around the joints and degeneration of articular cartilage [42].
HA is mainly composed of important factors such as D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and these factors play an important role in nourishing cartilage and protecting joints [43]. HA is degraded and diluted by exudates, resulting in a decrease in the molecular weight and endogenous concentration of HA in the knee joint cavity of patients with KOA. These changes reduce the viscoelasticity of the knee cartilage and reduce the knee's ability to resist mechanical stress and damage [11,44]. Many clinical studies have also shown that HA can effectively relieve knee pain and improve knee function [45- 47]. However, some researchers have shown that HA does not improve regeneration of damaged cartilage, particularly in elderly patients with severe KOA [44,48]. PRP is highly concentrated autologous plasma containing a variety of growth factors that promote the healing of ligaments, tendons, and bones, including platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-b, vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and bioactive proteins [49-51]. As a vector for large growth factors [52], PRP promotes tissue repair [53] and is increasingly used to treat KOA. PRP plays an important role in mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and cartilage formation through a combination of various

growth factors [54]. It has been reported that PRP may have a positive effect on inducing migration, proliferation, and differentiation of precursor cells in cartilage. Therefore, PRP can effectively repair the damaged cartilage of the knee joint [55] while reducing the effects of knee pain and inflammatory responses [56]. These effects of PRP make it a new drug treatment for KOA.
Most of the previous systematic reviews have shown that PRP is an effective alternative treatment for longterm relief of knee pain and improved joint function in KOA patients. However, the previous conclusions were reached on the basis of a small number of RCTs [23- 26,27,57], and thus, the time effect of PRP injection therapy on KOA has not been fully investigated. Chang et al. [58] found that patients receiving PRP injections showed better, longer-lasting improvements than patients receiving HA treatment; however, most of the studies that were included in the analysis were case series, and only five were RCTs. Laudy et al. [27] pooled 10 trials, including six RCTs, and found that PRP injections were more effective than placebo or HA injections for alleviating pain symptoms and improving joint motor function in KOA patients. Another recent meta-analysis [11] included 13 studies (10 RCTs) and synthesized the WOMAC scores to compare the efficacy of PRP injections with that of HA injections. Based on a large number of RCTs, this study evaluated the effects of PRP treatment on knee joint pain and physiological function at different times after injection.
In our study, the data from 15 RCTs showed that long-term pain relief and functional improvement in the PRP group were superior to those in the HA group. Divergent results were observed in the WOMAC, VAS, IKDC, and Lequesne Index scores, as well as in the occurrence of adverse events. The principal findings of this study were that within one to three months postinjection, subjects in the PRP group and HA group had similar experiences with respect to pain relief (WOMAC pain score and VAS pain score) and functional improvement (WOMAC total score, WOMAC function score, and IKDC score). In addition, no significant differences in

the Lequesne Index were observed between the PRP and HA groups after six months. However, subjects in the PRP group experienced significantly better pain relief (WOMAC pain score and VAS pain score) and functional improvement (WOMAC function score, WOMAC total score, and IKDC score) between six and 12 months postinjection than those in the HA group. In addition, the HA and PRP groups did not display different adverse event rates.
Heterogeneity was different between all measured parameters, indicating that the effects were inconsistent throughout the studies. Based on a careful review and evaluation of all included studies, we found some common problems. First, the pathology of KOA in the PRP and HA groups was different among all these included studies, and the distribution of KOA severity among the studies varied between grades I and IV (K-L grading scale). As shown in the studies by Chang et al. [58] and Filardo et al. [59], PRP has a better effect on patients with early or moderate forms of KOA but has a limited effect on patients with advanced forms of KOA. Therefore, patients with different stages of KOA may not exhibit the same responses to PRP or HA treatment [11].
Additionally, the number of injections and the length of the time between the two injections also varied among all these included studies. Among the studies that included multiple injections, an interval of two weeks was used in the studies by Montanez-Heredia et al. [35] and Su et al. [2], three weeks was adopted by Li et al. [29] and Raeissadat et al. [38], and one month was adopted by Duymus et al. [32] and Raeissadat et al. [36]. In the study by Gormeli et al. [34], no differences were observed between patients who received an HA injection and those who received a single-dose PRP injection, whereas the patients receiving multiple-dose PRP experienced greater improvement than the patients receiving either of the other two treatments. However, Patel et al. [53] concluded that a single dose of PRP injection and a double dose of PRP injection had the same therapeutic effect. The study by Go¨ rmeli et al. [34] further confirmed this conclusion in patients with advanced KOA, as there was no difference between treatment methods. These findings might provide guidance for future treatment options, because a consensus regarding treatment methods is currently unavailable.
As this study was a systematic review, it inevitably had certain limitations. Limitations exist in the recommendation of routine PRP injections as a treatment for KOA because the composition of PRP remains uncertain. Different types of PRP preparations have been used; thus, these preparations differ in the platelet counts, growth factor concentrations, and leukocyte counts depending on the patient characteristics and the preparation kit. Furthermore, the interval between injections and the optimal dosage are still areas of concern in the future because they might exert an effect on the postinjection process, and there are currently no published studies

supporting any specific injection protocol. In the present study, insufficient data were available for us to conduct a subgroup analysis to confirm whether multiple injections are necessary for patients with different stages of KOA.
Conclusions
Based on the current evidence, the use of PRP to treat KOA has a positive effect on pain levels and functional outcomes. In addition, PRP injections do not display different adverse event rates compared with HA injections. There is a lack of clarity regarding the number and frequency of PRP injections required to achieve maximum results and in the ideal treatment regimens for different severities of KOA.

Becoming Trauma Informed: Validating a Tool to Assess Health Professional's Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice
Simmy King, DNP, MS, MBA, RN-BC, NE-BC*; Kuan-Lung Daniel Chen, DrPH(c), MPH; Binny Chokshi, MD§

Abstract Introduction: To effectively address the negative health effects of early childhood trauma and adversity, healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions must understand the impact of adverse childhood experiences and trauma on health. This study aimed to validate a tool to assess knowledge, attitude, and practice of trauma-informed care among interdisciplinary pediatric healthcare staff. Methods: A 36-item survey tool, "Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices of Trauma-Informed Practice," was adopted and modified with permission from the author. We administered the survey electronically to 2,659 staff at a pediatric healthcare institution. To assess the tool's reliability and validity, internal consistency reliability testing, content validity, and construct validity assessments were conducted. Results: A total of 592 surveys were collected, representing a 22.3% response rate. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that 21 items provided the strongest internal consistency reliability for the overall tool and each factor. The overall Cronbach's alpha for the 21-item tool was 0.86, with 0.84 for the knowledge factor, 0.74 for the attitude factor, and 0.78 for the practice factor. The goodness of fit based on this analysis was good to adequate, with a 0.077 root mean square error of approximation. Conclusions: Healthcare professionals and organizations are in a unique position to improve the health and well-being of their patients by implementing a trauma-informed approach to minimize the impact of adverse childhood experiences and trauma. This validated tool will allow organizations to identify gaps in knowledge, attitude, and practice among staff to subsequently begin developing pointed strategies to achieve a culture of trauma-informed practice.

referred to definition is from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. They define trauma as "an event, series of events, or set of circumstances experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life-threatening with lasting adverse effects on the individuals functioning and mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well being."2 Although this definition provides context for
healthcare professionals, it is important to note that trauma is a subjective experience; how an individual responds to trauma may evolve and change over time and well into adulthood.3 The seminal study conducted by Felitti et al4 underscores the impact of 10 specific childhood traumas, now commonly known as "adverse childhood experiences" (ACEs), by demonstrating how exposure to ACEs can lead to risky health behaviors and poor health outcomes in a dose-dependent manner. These findings, together with current research regarding the negative impact of childhood experiences on the future health and functioning of pediatric patients, serve as a call to action for healthcare professionals to incorporate trauma-informed care (TIC) into their routine clinical practice.4-7 TIC is an approach to healthcare that is rooted in the realization of the widespread incidence of trauma, recognition of the signs and symptoms of trauma, response

to trauma in a full and integrated manner, and resisting retraumatization by organizations and healthcare professionals.2 Furthermore, TIC includes adherence to the following key principles: (1) safety, (2) trustworthiness, (3) peer support, (4) collaboration, (5) empowerment and choice, and (6) cultural, historical, and sex issues.2,8 TIC has historically been used among health professionals in social work, mental health, child services, and the juvenile justice program to inform their work, but it has not been routinely practiced by pediatric healthcare professionals.1,8 Now with increasing evidence that TIC can lead to improved patient care outcomes, healthcare institutions are recognizing the importance of clinician competency in TIC.9,10 In 2014, the AAP's (American Academy of Pediatrics) "Trauma Toolbox for Primary Care" highlighted the role of a trauma-informed approach in addressing childhood adversity and trauma in the pediatric primary care setting.11 Subsequent literature has highlighted the need for pediatric healthcare organizations to advance TIC12 by educating healthcare professionals and developing competency in TIC.13
Regional data from the 2016 National Child Health Survey showed that 47% of the children in our region have had 1 ACE.14 These data underscored the need for a coordinated approach to address trauma in the pediatric patients we care for at Children's National Health System. As a first step, we assessed the learning needs of our target audience, a crucial first step in developing a learning curriculum.15 Specifically, we wanted to measure knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) as they related to TIC to inform our educational intervention. The KAP method is a reliable and valid method to enhance KAP around a specific theme, establish baseline data, and suggest learner-centric intervention strategies.16 For larger organizations, the best method of conducting a formal learning needs gap analysis is to use a valid and reliable survey tool.15 Therefore, we searched for a validated tool for our needs assessment.
From our literature review, we found one study that measured nursing knowledge and experience related to TIC, but it was a qualitative study.17 Another study by Bruce et al18 surveyed providers working at a trauma center regarding TIC; however, this survey included questions related to posttraumatic stress, and these questions were not aligned with the intent of our work. Baker et al19 was the only article that developed and validated a tool to measure TIC, the ARTIC (Attitudes Related to TraumaInformed Care Scale). In this study, psychometric analysis established strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability for 45-item form with 7 subscales and a 35-item composite and 10-item short form. Although this tool was intended for use across disciplines, participants in the original study worked in education and human service settings.
Additionally, survey items were geared to measure the extent to which an individual or system is trauma-informed, with a lack of focus on understanding the important link between traumatic exposures and health outcomes. Missing from the available literature was a

validated tool that measured KAP related to TIC among healthcare professionals within a healthcare setting. As such, this study aimed to validate a tool to assess KAP of TIC among interdisciplinary pediatric healthcare staff.
METHODS Adopting Existing Survey Instrument
After a comprehensive literature review, we identified a survey tool that we could adapt for widespread use among healthcare professionals. The "Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices of Trauma-Informed Practice Survey" is a 36-item unpublished and unvalidated tool developed by Abdoh et al.20 Abdoh et al20 designed the tool based on a literature review, then conducted face validity assessment with staff at their community center and pilot-tested the tool with 17 multidisciplinary staff members at that site. The community center provides housing to individuals with substance dependencies and concurrent physical and mental health issues. Its staff consist of various professional disciplines, including physicians, social workers, nurses, and mental health support staff. Among the 36 survey items, 29 questions measure knowledge, attitudes, and practice; 12 items related to knowledge, 11 related to attitudes, and 6 related to practices. Each item has a 5-point Likert scale response format with options from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The other 7 items of the survey capture demographic data, including the respondent's role, department, years of experience, age group, and previous experience with TIC. We adopted this survey for our learning needs assessment after discussion with, and permission from, the author.
Face and Content Validity To establish face validity, internal experts in the field of childhood adversity and trauma reviewed each item to assess the degree to which it would measure each of the 3 factors: KAP related to TIC. Internal expert qualifications included serving as faculty facilitators for continuing medical education on TIC institutionally, peer-reviewed publications related to mental health and trauma, employing TIC principles in their pediatric practice, coordinating federal and private funding on childhood trauma, and presenting at national conferences. We provided the following definitions of knowledge, attitudes, and practice to the internal experts as reference. Knowledge was defined as the degree to which staff members were aware of, informed about, or familiar with the applicability of TIC in the healthcare setting. Attitude was defined as how staff felt or thought about TIC, and practice was defined as how staff applied their knowledge and attitudes about TIC into their practice. We also asked these experts to review and assess whether the items on the tool should be included. Based on the review by the internal experts, only 1 item in the original tool, "Trauma-informed practice (TIP) shares many similarities to harm reduction," was removed from the survey because our survey was being implemented in a pediatric healthcare institution whose

2

King et al · Pediatric Quality and Safety (2019) 4:5;e215

www.pqs.com

staff is not well versed in harm reduction techniques. Additionally, the word "client" was replaced with "patient" to better align with the context of a large healthcare institution, versus a community setting. When determining content validity, institutional experts considered the item's (1) relevance to TIP in general, (2) relevance to its associated factor, (3) alignment with common wording used at the institution, and (4) clarity of wording.
Data Collection Before data collection, the organizational Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the study. We collected the initial data between November and December 2017. An online survey platform, SurveyMonkey® (San Mateo, Calif.), was used to administer the survey tool, and the initial request to participate was sent via hospital email, followed by 2 subsequent email reminders until the survey closing date.
Construct Validity: Confirmatory Factor Analysis The survey tool was adopted specifically for its ability to assess the 3 latent factors: knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Therefore, the priority for tool validation was to investigate whether the survey items are indeed manifest variables of the 3 factors.
Using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess the association between survey items and the 3 theorized latent factors, we assigned numeric values to each response for the analysis: Strongly disagree was assigned the value of 0, disagree a value of 1, neutral a value of 2, agree a value of 3, and strongly agree a value of 4. We assessed model fit based on factor loadings for individual survey items and goodness of fit tests commonly used in literature,21-23 including chi-square test, the Bentler comparative fit index24,25 (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion were also used to compare models. We tested survey items with a high residual for association with different factors based on modification indices.26 Items sharing a standard covariance residual of 1.96 would prompt a review of the modification indices. If the item's modification index was >3.84, it would then prompt an attempt to assess whether the item fits better with a different factor.27 We removed items if the model fit did not improve as a result of changing the associated factor.26,27
Reliability: Internal Consistency We assessed internal consistency by calculating Cronbach's alpha for each factor and the overall tool each time CFA produced an acceptable model.28 Using a combination of CFA and Cronbach's alpha for survey tool validation is consistent with similar research in the field.23,28
RESULTS Survey Respondents: Descriptive Data
We distributed the survey to 2,659 staff members. A total of 592 survey responses were collected--representing a

22.3% response rate. Among the responses collected, 37 were removed for no response on scale items, and 4 were removed for repeat entries. We deleted entries with missing scale item data listwise. Among the remaining 511 respondents, 54.4% were nurses, and 19.2% were attending physicians. Age distribution among the respondents was mostly even. A quarter of respondents (24.1%) had <2 years of experience in their current role, and 41.7% had 10 years in their current role. Approximately onethird of the respondents received some TIP training before completing the survey (Table 1).
Factor Analysis We conducted CFA using Stata 15 software (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX) to assess model fit and adjust the model to improve fit. The sample exceeds the commonly recommended minimum size of 300.29 Data distribution for all items, except for one, meet multivariate normality. Therefore, we use maximum likelihood, which allows for mild departure for multivariate normality, as the estimation method for CFA.21 As part of the model fitting process, we removed 7 items from the survey. The final 21-item model showed adequate overall model fit with a 0.077 RMSEA.28 The chi-square statistics is 748.05 with a P value of <0.001. However, for sample sizes >500, it is common for the chi-square test to find statistical significance.29 The CFI is 0.857, and the TLI is 0.839, each falls slightly below the 0.9 cutoff for "good fit."23-25 Altogether,

*Original numbers represent those of Abdoh et al20 and begin with 8 since the first 7 items are demographic questions. Eight items from the original 36-item survey were removed: 10, trauma can have lifelong effects that may span generations; 14, TIP requires providers to recognize, understand, and respond to the effects of trauma; 15, TIP aims to create safe environments that promote healing and recovery from trauma exposure; 16, TIP includes understanding the physical, psychological, and emotional safety of both the patient and the provider; 17, when using TIP, you must know specific details of a patient's history of trauma; 19, retraumatization can occur in both community and institutional settings; 24, TIP shares many similarities to harm reduction (removed after content validity review, before confirmatory factor analysis); and 29, I have all the resources I need to engage in TIP.

the indices suggest an acceptable model. Internal consistency was good: Cronbach's alpha values were within acceptable range with values of 0.74 for each of the 3 factors.30 Specifically, the values were 0.84 for knowledge (with an item-to-total correlation range of 0.42-0.59), 0.74 for attitude (0.37-0.66), and 0.78 for practice (0.30-0.59).
The standardized interfactor correlation coefficients were 0.55 for knowledge-attitude (P < 0.001), 0.28 for knowledge-practice (P < 0.001), and 0.65 for attitude-practice (P < 0.001). The interfactor correlations suggest, by theory, some level of association among KAP factors for TIP. The medium to low value of the interfactor correlations also suggests that it is not redundant for the tool to include all 3 factors.
We reduced the total number of items from 28 to 21 in the final model (Table 2). In the final 21-item model, 7 items measure knowledge (5 items removed), 8 items measure attitude (2 items removed), and 6 items measure practice (0 items removed). The 7 removed items and any subset of the 7 do not form a fourth factor that would be theoretically meaningful.

DISCUSSION
This study aimed to establish the validity of the "Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice Related to TraumaInformed Practice" tool. Our analysis indicated that the 21-item version could reliably assess KAP related to TIC among healthcare professionals in a pediatric institution. With increased awareness among healthcare professionals regarding the health impact of ACEs and trauma, healthcare organizations will need to effectively assess the learning needs of their staff to address gaps in KAP to implement a TIC approach that meets the needs of their patients.
At our institution, we used our survey results to develop and deliver an educational intervention for hospital staff. We partnered with the National Center on Trauma-Informed Care and Alternatives to Restraint and Seclusion, part of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, to provide 7 half-day learning sessions between January and March 2018. We have trained over 700 staff members and measured pre and post KAP using the validated KAP related to TIC tool. Our next steps include analyzing postintervention

data and performing additional tool analysis that we will share in a future article.
Limitations The first limitation of this work is that we adopted a preexisting tool that had not been previously assessed for validity and reliability. We based the initial item generation process on literature review findings, and we conducted the pilot test with a small sample--without assessment for construct validity. Recognition of these limitations was the primary motivation to validate the tool further using quantitative methods.
The second limitation is that we did not apply other forms of reliability and validity, such as alternate forms reliability, test-retest reliability, and criterion-related validity. We distributed a single version of the survey to hospital staff only once before we conducted the education program. Without distributing an alternate survey that worded questions differently, we could not assess alternate forms reliability. With a single round of baseline data, we could not examine the tool's temporal stability. We conducted a literature search but could not find an existing "gold standard" scale for measuring TIC KAP for healthcare workers or workers in other professional sectors. Without a "gold standard" scale to compare against, we could not assess criterion-related validity.31
A third limitation is the generalizability of the survey. The primary objective of this study is to test the theorized item-factor relationships using CFA, for which the sample size is large enough. However, the sample is drawn exclusively from a single institution, and the response rate (22.3%) is low compared with typical online surveys.32 Although there was diversity in the role and department affiliation, the possibility of bias exists. To make the scale truly generalizable for the field, we recommend that additional data be collected through a multicenter study approach from other healthcare agencies and institutions for further validation. Also, this study was done only in a pediatric institution. The original literature on ACE exposure was done in an adult cohort,3 and therefore, it is well known that this science is relevant to adult populations as well. Further testing of this tool for applicability in adult healthcare institutions is needed because this work is of equal importance in the adult healthcare field.
Finally, goodness of fit indices CFI and TLI came close but still fell short of the commonly accepted threshold for good model fit. However, experts have recommended a balanced approach to consider both the theory and model fit. Too much focus on adhering to cutoffs of goodness of fit indices could lead to type 1 error, incorrectly rejecting an acceptable model.23,33 In other words, theory and the RMSEA suggest that this is an acceptable model. It would be incorrect to reject it solely due to CFI and TLI values missing the commonly accepted thresholds. Having considered both the theory and the model fit, we believe our scale will be useful for implementing TIC in healthcare

settings despite not meeting all of the goodness of fit indices.
CONCLUSIONS
We believe that healthcare organizations can take a proactive approach to improve the health and well-being of their patients by implementing a trauma-informed approach to minimize the impact of childhood trauma and adversity. Accurately assessing the needs of learners is an essential step in transforming the KAP among healthcare organizations and healthcare professionals as they relate to TIC. This tool will allow pediatric organizations to identify gaps in KAP among staff to subsequently develop strategies to achieve a culture of TIP.

Dear Colleagues and Friends,
The Institute of Human Virology (IHV) at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, the Global Virus Network (GVN), and the Moscow Center for HIV/AIDS Treatment and Prevention welcome you to the Institute's 15th Annual International Meeting. For only the second time in IHV's history, the meeting is convening outside of the Baltimore/Washington DC area. This year we gather in Moscow, a city obviously of deep historical significance and home to stunning architecture, cultural tradition, and the Russian Federation Capitol. Further, uniquely this year, the meeting will include presentations from members of the Global Virus Network, thereby broadening the scope of the meeting. The IHV Annual Meeting has fostered international scientific cooperation since its inception. This year's event recognizes both our commitment to the global fight against HIV/AIDS as well as a focus on several other human viral diseases, and the critical roles played by the scientists, physicians, and public health officials in the Russian Federation. We are pleased to join together for hosting this meeting and believe it will impact the future of research on viral diseases in our countries and throughout our network of collaborating institutions.
This year's open meeting is from Sunday, September 8 through Wednesday, September 12. An outstanding program of Russian and international experts in medical virology will be presented in the Moscow City Meeting Hall. While our major focus continues to be in HIV/AIDS, through the Global Virus Network, we will expand the scope to cover other important human viral diseases including hepatitis, measles, influenza, enterovirus, polio and hemorrhagic fever. For each, we concentrate on the latest developments in antiviral drug treatment or

Moscow Center for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment
The Moscow Center for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment (AIDS Center) of the Moscow Health Department is the main unit of the city service providing HIV prevention and medical treatment services for Moscow citizens living with HIV/AIDS. The center was established based on a department of the Clinical Hospital No. 2 for Infectious Diseases which, since 1985, had started receiving first individuals in the Soviet Union identified as HIV/AIDS positive.
The specialists who provided medical treatment to the first HIV/AIDS positive individuals formed the backbone of the AIDS Center team. Today it employs more than 200 people working in its 7 departments. The AIDS Center receives patients from healthcare institutions who need their HIV-positive diagnosis to be confirmed and be further registered with the Center or those with controversial HIV antibody test results. The Center provides all types of specialist medical treatment to the HIV/AIDS positive people. Patients and their relatives can get consulting, methodological and psychological assistance as well.
The major success of the Center has been the implementation in Moscow medical institutions of a program to reduce the risk of a vertical transmission from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy and birth. It comes to be of particular relevance today when increasing numbers of HIV-positive women decide to have children. The implementation of special innovative prevention programs has lead to more than a six-fold reduction in the probability of an HIV-positive child birth which is now less than 3 percent.
The Center contributes to scientific research, as well as approves and implements new methods of HIV diagnosis and treatment. The AIDS Center coordinates HIV prevention efforts of all Moscow medical facilities and monitors the quality of HIV laboratory diagnosis in Moscow healthcare institutions.

IHV 2013 Lifetime Achievement Award for Scientific Contributions
Vadim I. Agol, MD, PhD, DSc

Vadim I. Agol is a, if not the, number one polio virologist in the world in terms of the basic science of these viruses. He received an MD diploma cum laude from the 1st Moscow Medical School in 1951 and worked for 5 years at the Karaganda Medical Institute. In 1956 he joined the Institute for Poliomyelitis Research in Moscow (now M. P. Chumakov Institute of Poliomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences) as junior researcher and has been associated with this Institute until now (from 1957 as senior researcher, in 1961-2009 as head of Laboratory of Biochemistry, and now as chief researcher at this lab). He received a PhD in 1954 from the first Moscow Medical School and DSc in 1967 from the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences. In 1963 he participated in the organization of the Department of Virology of the Moscow State University, serving there as Docent and in 1969-2012 as Professor. He also established and continues as head of the Department of Virus/Cell Interactions at the Institute of Physical-Chemical Biology of the same University.

His main scientific interests are focused on diverse aspects of molecular and cellular biology of RNA-containing viruses (primarily picornaviruses) such as non-genetic and genetic interactions (co-discovery of complementation between non-enveloped RNA viruses; first biochemical proof of the intermolecular recombination between RNA genomes; demonstration of the existence of the non-replicative mechanism of this process), synthesis of viral proteins (first cell-free system for the faithful translation of picornavirus proteins; structural and functional analysis of translational cis-acting element of picornaviral RNAs; discovery and characterization of non-canonical translation initiation factors required for the synthesis of picornaviral proteins; identification of a protease involved in processing of the viral polyprotein; discovery of picornaviral leader proteins; first translational mapping of the flavivirus genome), replication of viral RNA (first evidence for involvement of host proteins in the synthesis of picornavirus RNA; characterization of viral 2C protein involved in the viral replication; functional and structural characterization of replicative cis-elements of the picornavirus genomes), neurovirulence and attenuation of picornaviruses (first mapping of viral phenotypic traits by recombinational analysis; discovery of dependence of attenuation on modulation of viral translation), cellular response to picornaviral infection (discovery of the ability of picornaviruses to trigger and suppress apoptotic response of the cells; discovery of the ability of picornaviruses to permeabilize the nuclear envelope by different mechanisms; demonstration that major picornavirus-induced cellular damages may be caused by interplay between host defense and viral anti-defenses and may be uncoupled from viral reproduction; proposal on the existence of a distinct set of viral proteins, dubbed security proteins, specifically dedicated to the anti-defensive activities), evolution (roles of changes in attenuation determinants, antigenic properties and recombination in the evolution of vaccine polioviruses; molecular epidemiology of poliomyelitis). He actively participated in the world struggle against polio.

Dr. Agol is an (elected) corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Honorary Scientist of Russia, recipient of the Triumph prize in biology and medicine, foreign member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, and also received other national and international awards.

Apart from numerous scientific publications, Dr. Agol has published four books of poetry and a book containing an autobiographical novel of his father, well known Soviet geneticist and philosopher Israel Agol, and his own autobiography.

101 Biomedical Prevention of HIV/AIDS in Russia
E.V. Karamov and R.M. Khaitov Research Institute of Immunology, Federal Medical and Biological Agency,RU
The epidemic of HIV/AIDS in Russia is currently in its concentrated phase characterized by concomitant coinfections (hepatitides B and C and tuberculosis). Although subtype A1 is dominant, subtype B and CRF 03 (A/B recombinant) are also present. Recent subepidemic eruptions of HIV infection in Siberia/Urals and the Far East have involved A/G recombinant and subtype C, respectively. Approaches to biomedical prevention of HIV/AIDS in Russia include vaccine and microbicide development.
Candidate HIV vaccines have been developed independently by three Russian research centers. In one of them, the conjugated protein-polymer vaccine VICHREPOL, use is made of an original domestic immunoadjuvant polyoxydonium. This candidate, developed in the Institute of Immunology, is currently undergoing a phase II clinical trial.
A broad-coverage screening of natural and synthetic compounds for anti-HIV activity is currently underway in Russia, aiming at identification of chemicals appropriate for pre-exposure prophylaxis and use as microbicides. Unique compositions of antivirals have been developed, as well as nanotechnologybased means of their delivery, the combinations thereof showing significant promise as microbicide preparations.
The presentation will highlight the present state of research on biomedical prevention of HIV/AIDS in Russia.

HIV/AIDS vaccines in Russia: clinical trials
and estimation of acceptance in population
1Gudima G., 1Sidorovich I., 1Karamov E., 2Bogachanskaya N., 2Pavlov S., 2Efimenko S., 2Reshetnikov A., 1Khaitov R. 1Institute of Immunology FMBA, Moscow; 2Institute of Sociology of Medicine, 1st Moscow Medical University, RU
HIV/AIDS vaccines and also PrEP are considered as the most perspective approaches to control HIV/AIDS epidemic. Candidate conjugated polymer-subunit HIV vaccine VICHREPOL, developed in Moscow Institute of Immunology, successfully passed phase I clinical trials and now is at the start of phase II trials. Two other candidate vaccines (DNA-based and viral vectorbased) are also passed phase I trials. Positive effect of vaccination depends of the coverage of population and this coverage depends of vaccine uptake. Estimation of possible uptake of HIV vaccine is very important to provide its further effective application. Pilot investigation of readiness for HIV vaccination in Russia (Moscow region) was performed (416 persons, 254 (61%) - men, 162 (39%) - women, age of 16-55). 60% of respondents were ready for HIV vaccination. 79% of respondents with risk of HIV infection, agreed to be vaccinated vs 48% of those disclaimed the risk of HIV infection. Readiness for HIV vaccination is 20% lower in respondents with children vs childless. In case of 30% vaccine efficacy readiness for vaccination was 3.5 points of 10; in case of 50% efficacy - 5.2 points of 10; 8.8 points of 10 - in case of 90-95% efficacy. Readiness for vaccination also depends from its duration, number of doses in course, possible adverse side effects, mode of vaccination. 20% of respondents agreed only for free vaccination, 45% - for paid vaccination. Readiness for HIV vaccination is lower in general population (60% vs 78%) and in HIV infection risk groups (79% vs 95-97%) in Russia vs some other countries [Suraratdecha et al., 2005]. It is necessary to improve education programs aimed to inform on HIV
vaccines development, its safety and application.

103 Genetic factors defining resistance and susceptibility to HIV/AIDS
Kofiadi IA, Alexeev LP, Khaitov RM FSBI "NRC Institute of Immunology" FMBA of Russia, RU
One of the priorities for fundamental biomedical science is the discovery of the molecular-genetic basis of HIV pathogenesis. The progress in this area widens the possibilities for further improvement of HIV/AIDS prevention and therapy approaches. In this framework we have studied the population distribution of CCR5 rs333, CCR2 rs1799864, SDF1 rs1801157, HCP5 rs2395029, HLA-C rs9264942 and HLA-B*5701 genetic polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to HIV and AIDS and antiviral drugs intolerance among 1120 seronegative individuals comprising 12 ethnically distinct groups inhabiting Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Moldova(Pomors, Russians(Vologda and Pskov region), Belarus, Ukrainians, Gagauz, Udmurts, Tatars, Chechens, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tuvinians). The rs333 variant is represented at most in the population of Pomors. The homozygotes who have significantly lower risk of HIV infection comprising 3% of the population. The least frequency of CCR5 polymorphism was described for Chechens, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tuvinians: 6, 6, 5 and 2% correspondingly. The highest incidence of CCR2 polymorphism was described for Chechens, Kazakhs and Kyrgyz. The other alleles under study did not reveal significant differences in distribution. The protective effect of the studied polymorphisms in CCR5, CCR2,  SDF1 genes is characterized as cumulative. Based on the frequencies of three-loci genotypes we have established the values of relative hazard of AIDS onset and relative hazard of AIDS-caused death for the populations under study. The risks fall in range 0.79-0.94 and 0.76-0.93, correspondingly. We have found that interpopulation genetic variability confers for statistically relevant differences in the hazards estimated.

104 Cell-to-cell transmission of HIV: role of virological synapse
Mazurov DV, Filatov AV Institute of Immunology, RU
HIV-1 infects CD4+ T-lymphocyte by cell free viral particles released from the surface of effector cells or after the formation of intercellular contact between infected cell and healthy lymphocyte. The last way of infection was designated as cell-to-cell viral transmission. The current studies suggest that cell-tocell transmission of HIV occurs in peripheral lymph nodes at the early stage of infection and is more efficient pathway of virus dissemination than cell-free infection. One of the most accepted models of HIV transmission is the formation of virological synapse (VS); tight intercellular adhesion junction sharing structural similarity with immunological synapse. VS forms after HIV surface protein gp120 expressed on the plasma membrane of infected cells in prefusogenic conformation recognizes CD4 receptor on target cell. Viruses transmitted across VS undergo endocytosis by target cells, so that viral entry occurs via endocytic compartments and not via cell surface. This feature of cell-to-cell transmission accounts for the resistance of HIV to the neutralizing antibodies. Although the different stages of HIV cell-to-cell transmission have been extensively studied, the levels of correlation between virus transmission and targets infection were not accurately quantified. To fill up the gap in our understanding of cell-mediated viral infection, we have developed a new methods and improved vectors to quantify the levels of VS formation, cell-to-cell infection, and macromolecular transport across the cell-cell contact. New T cell lines stably producing recombinant virus like particles and reporter RNA, as well as modified target cells were generated.

105 Rationale for HIV vaccines design
Irina A.Nikolaeva, Igor G.Sidorovich National Research Center - The Institute of Immunology of the Federal Medical- Biological Agency, RU
Development of an effective and safe HIV vaccine presents unique challenges. Despite the progress in understanding the biology of HIV-1 and its recognition by the human immune system, we have not yet developed an efficacious HIV-1 vaccine. During the last years, the results were obtained that has given hope that vaccination may prevent HIV-1 acquisition. The results of post-RV144 correlates and sieve analyses suggest that vaccine worked probably involving an immunological mechanism in the second variable loop (V2). A high resolution structure of the envelope trimer was solved, and this information is being used for the design of new generations of vaccines aimed at inducing protective antibodies. New techniques have facilitated the discovery of new human broadly neutralizing antibodies (BrNAbs) that target and delineate diverse conserved epitopes on the envelope glycoprotein spike. The epitopes of these BrNAbs can serve as templates for immunogen design aimed to induce similar antibodies. A separate goal of HIV vaccine research is to identify the best strategy for immunization and delivery agents. Several vectors and adjuvants have been developed. Significant advances have been made towards the development of tools to assess preclinical efficacy and understanding the correlates of protection in non human primate models. We observe the preventive potential of microbicides, PrEP, and earlier antiretroviral treatment of infected individuals has been demonstrated. All of these interventions may have a significant impact in reducing the incidence of HIV infections. However a safe and efficacious vaccine will be the most efficient way to control global HIV-1 pandemic, and scientific opportunities look promising.

107 The modern methods for HIV/AIDS vaccine evaluation
S.V. Korobova, I.G. Sidorovich, G.V. Kornilaeva FSBI "NSC Institute of Immunology" FMBA of RU
The spread of HIV/AIDS increases worldwide, a safe and efficacious vaccine remains the cornerstone for a prevention strategy to stop HIV-1 epidemic. Both humoral (neutralizing antibodies) and cellular (CTL) responses are able to control HIV infection. Non-neutralizing HIV-specific antibodies could play an important role in preventing or controlling HIV infection. These antibodies can bind to infected cells and recruit innate immune effector cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, to lyse infected cells through antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibodydependent cell-mediated virus inhibition (ADCVI). The measurement of immune responses directed specifically against the HIV is critical for understanding the interplay between the virus and the host immune system. By characterizing the immunological correlates of protection against HIV infection, such measurements will aid in the development of efficacious prophylactic vaccine. To improve vaccine antigens and adjuvant, it is also necessary to asses a similarity of vaccine - and virus - induced immune responses The evaluation of antigenspecific humoral response includes measurement amount and specificity of vaccine-induced antibodies (in ELISA or WB), their neutralizing activity and ADCC or ADCVI. ELISPOT, intracellular cytokine flow cytometry assays and Luminex are the most common assays to determine CTL response. They all determine immune response by the detection of the cytokines (IFNgamma, TNF-alpha, IL2) secreted by cells upon antigenstimulation. MHC tetramer binding assay measures the absolute number of cells that recognize a particular epitope without providing any information regarding the functionality of the cells.

108 Development of universal vaccines against flu: reality and prospects
Shmarov M.M. Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, RU
Two surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are the main antigens for obtaining traditional flu vaccines due to their high immunogenicity and ability to induce generation of neutralizing antibodies. High genetically instability of influenza virus provides antigenic diversity of these glycoproteins between strains. Subunit vaccines based on one of these surface antigens are characterized by narrow specificity. Modern vaccines should provide protection against several or all subtypes of influenza A viruses. In addition sporadic influenza outbreaks of newly emerged influenza A viruses may cause the next pandemic.
Today there are no flu vaccines of a wide range of action, so-called "universal" vaccines. Several flu vaccines with a broad cross-protectivity are tested in different phases of clinical trials.
In this report the analysis of the modern researches directed on creation of flu "universal" vaccines including data obtained by researchers of Gamaleya institute of epidemiology and microbiology is carried out.
Genetic immunization technology is used for development of "universal" vaccine. Recombinant pseudoadenoviral particles coding of influenza virus conservative antigens were used as a vector for gene delivery. Polypeptide, containing hemagglutinin conservative epitopes, was used in addition to traditional influenza conservative antigens M1, M2 and NP. Animal experiments demonstrated that developed vaccines were very efficient against different influenza subtypes (80%-100% survivability).

109 Problems and prospects of development of the subunit TB vaccine

110 Broadly neutralizing antibodies for serotherapy and vaccine design
Antonio Lanzavecchia Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Bellinzona and Institute of Microbiology, DE

Tuberculosis (TB) causes about 1.4 million deaths each year. Currently the only licensed anti-tuberculosis vaccine is Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). This live attenuated vaccine has been in use for over 80 years and has displayed up to 80% efficacy against serious forms of the disease, e.g., meningitis, in children. However, efficacy in adults against pulmonary tuberculosis ranges from 0 to 80% in different trials. The protective immunity generated by BCG decreases with time, and almost disappears after 20-25 years, resulting in a vulnerability of the adult population to primary infection and reactivation of latent TB. Thus, development of an effective preventive vaccine and new "post-infection" vaccine are still important aims of vaccinology.
In this study we report the development of novel subunit protein-based vaccine against tuberculosis. Our vaccine consists of two recombinant mycobacterium proteins - Ag85A and fusion protein ESAT6-CFP10. These antigens are strongly recognized by T cells and they have demonstrated protective efficacy in animal models. However, because the protein component of the subunit vaccine is poorly immunogenic, the recombinant protein vaccine was adjuvanted with novel, three-component adjuvant system composed of the dextran, cationic DEAEdextran and oligodeoxynucleotide CpG. This adjuvant was chosen on the basis of its ability to induce strong protective immunity in animal models of M. tuberculosis infection, by delivering a TLR9 ligand into the endosomal pathway. Recombinant vaccine proteins possess dextranbinding domain, which helps create «depot» effect and provide prolonged interaction of vaccine antigen with T-cells.

Memory B lymphocytes and long-lived plasma cells represent a repository of the antigenic experience of an individual. By analyzing the specificity and function of these cells we can gain insights into the human immune response to pathogens and vaccines, identify correlates of protection, and isolate neutralizing antibodies and protective T cells. To interrogate human memory B cell and plasma cell repertoires we developed two culture-based high-throughput methods that are used to isolate, with high efficiency, human monoclonal antibodies of distinctive specificities. Unusually potent neutralizing antibodies against human cytomegalovirus were isolated from infected donors and used to identify the viral ligands and to design an experimental vaccine. We also isolated antibodies of exceptional breadth, such as a pan-influenza A neutralizing antibody and an antibody that neutralizes both respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus. By targeting conserved structures, these broadly neutralizing antibodies are less prone to select escape mutants and are therefore promising candidates for prophylaxis and therapy of infections as well as tools for the design of improved subunit vaccines.

We investigated immunogenicity and protection properties of our vaccine on mice and guinea pigs models of tuberculosis, and also performed toxicity studies. We demonstrated that our subunit vaccine stimulates th1 immune response and is protective against tuberculosis with the same efficacy as BCG. Furthermore, our vaccine showed good result in toxicity studies in mice, guinea pigs
and rabbits.

111 Update on dengue vaccines
Alexander C. Schmidt GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, US
Forty percent of the world's population is at risk for dengue, and 100 million apparent infections are estimated to occur annually. In a minority of cases, dengue fever progresses to severe disease at the time of defervescence, inducing a capillary leak syndrome accompanied by thrombocytopenia that can result in shock and organ failure. Thus the medical need for a dengue vaccine is obvious. The four dengue virus serotypes are transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, and protective immunity against the infecting serotype (homotypic immunity) is long lived and thought to be conferred by virus-neutralizing antibodies and some T cell help. However, antibodies induced by one serotype often cross-react with the other serotypes. If antibodies fail to neutralize and instead opsonize, they can enable the virus to infect IgG receptorbearing cells. This phenomenon, termed antibodydependent enhancement, is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of severe dengue, and is of concern to vaccine developers. Several investigational dengue vaccines are currently in clinical development, and many different vaccination approaches are being explored. These span from live-attenuated dengue viruses to chimera between yellow fever and dengue viruses, to subunit, DNA, and whole virus inactivated vaccines. A recent Phase 2b study of the vaccine most advanced in development did not show statistically significant protection against disease due to any serotype, adding much uncertainty to the entire field. Our understanding of the contributions of humoral and cell mediated responses to protection and to pathogenesis is clearly less than perfect, and selection, presentation and adjuvantation of antigens need thought and attention.

112 The Development of Enterovirus 71 Vaccine
Li Xiuling, Zhang Zhongyang, Wang Xiaoxiao, Hao Chunsheng, Li Yi, Zhang Chong, Zhang Chen, Chen Ming, Ning haijing, Liu Yu, Chen Lei, Ma Shuhua, Yang Yongjuan, Song Dongmei, Shen Xinliang National Vaccine & Serum Institute, CN
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major cause of epidemic outbreaks of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide. The virus belongs to the family Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus. 3 genotypes--A, B, and Cand more than 10 sub-genotypes have been identified. After the initial identification of this virus in 1969, some large outbreaks of HFMD have been reported worldwide.
EV71-induced HFMD is usually characterized by the formation of maculopapular or vesicular lesions on the skin and oral mucosa, especially on the palms, soles, and mouth.. There were a greater number of fatal cases with brainstem encephalitis, pulmonary edema and/or hemorrhage, and cardiopulmonary collapse.
Developing effective vaccines is considered a top choice among all control measures. We evaluated the ability of inactivated virus vaccine to elicit neutralizing antibody and to provide protection against lethal infection of EV71 in suckling mice. The purity of EV71 vaccine was up to 96.8% by HPLC identification. The purified EV71 vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies, these antibodies were shown to be protective against lethal infection when passively transferred to susceptible newborn mice. With a challenge dose of 50LD50 virus/ mouse, suckling mice born to dams immunized with inactivated virus showed 100% survival. In preliminary animal trial, no side effects were detected when monkeys were immunized with purified EV71 vaccine either at normal or large doses.
The vaccine was approved of the clinical evaluation in 2009. The phase 1/2/3 clinical trail was completed in March, 2013. The data suggested that the inactivated EV71 vaccine had a clinically acceptable safety profile and good immunogenicity in healthy children and infants. Our data indicated that inactivated EV71 vaccine is the choice of vaccine preparation capable of fulfilling the demand for effective control.

113 Epidemics of Acute Gastroenteritis Caused by Viruses and Vaccine Development in China
Shen Shuo Wuhan Institute of Biological Product, China National Biotec Group (CNBG), CN
The leading etiological agents of viral gastroenteritis are group A rotaviruses, noroviruses, adenoviruses (type 40, 41) and astroviruses in China in the last 20 years. The prevailing serotypes of rotaviruses are G type 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9, while G8 has been emerged recently in China. Accordingly, trivalent and hexavalent vaccines are under development by the two Institutes under CNBG. The trivalent oral vaccines are reassortants of VP4 and VP7 genes of human strains and other backbone genes of Lanzhou lamb rotavirus (LLR). The safety of lamb rotavirus vaccine strain has been proved since licensing in 2000 in China. The phase 3 clinical trials of the trivalent vaccines are in the progress in Henan province, China. The hexavalent oral vaccines are reassortants of VP7 genes of human strains and the other genes of UK strain, developed by and collaborated with NIH, USA, and PATH. The preclinical studies at Wuhan Institute of Biological Product have been completed and the hexavalent vaccine is ready for phase 1 clinical study. The novoviruses are increasingly detected in epidemics of acute viral gastroenteritis and spontaneous cases of people of all ages in China, including the rapid spreading of the newly emerged pandemic GII.4 variant (Sydney strain 2012) to China. The new Sydney strains were isolated in different areas and analysis of complete sequence demonstrated the rapid evolution. The surveillances and epidemic studies of these emerging viruses support the development of vaccines against the infections caused by noroviruses. The new variant co-circulated with other genotypes of GI and GII genogroups in human and multiple valent vaccines may needed to be developed..

114 VLPs and particle vaccines
Luigi Buonaguro, MD Ist. Naz.Tumori "Fond. G. Pascale," IT
VLPs represent a powerful tool for vaccine development, representing the closest strategy to the native viruses for displaying and delivering conformational epitopes, with improved induction of antibodies and immune response in its whole. Moreover, the lack of genetic material makes VLPs the "safer counterpart" of live attenuated or killed viral vaccines which, indeed, may induce limited but possible undesired effects.
VLP-based vaccines have been developed from both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses to target infectious and non-infectious diseases and are in various stages of development spanning preclinical evaluation to market. In particular, the only two preventive cancer vaccines licensed are based on VLP approach (HBV and HPV vaccines).
Overall, pre-clinical and clinical trials with different VLP-based vaccines have shown they are well tolerated and can be administered by a number of routes, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, oral or intranasal. VLP vaccines have also been demonstrated to be highly immunogenic and capable of stimulating protective immunity in a number of instances when administered with or without adjuvants. Their potent immunogenicity is a result of several factors, including the ability to incorporate key immunogenic properties of viruses into a single entity and to hit the cells relevant for initiate an effective adaptive immune response.

115 Immune Correlates of Protection in Rhesus Monkeys
Dan Barouch Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA,US
We have previously reported the protective efficacy of Ad26/MVA vector regimens expressing SIVsmE543 Env/Gag/Pol antigens against SIVmac251 challenge. Here we assess the potential utility of adding a protein trimer boost to adenovirus based vaccine regimens. We produced stable SIV and HIV Env gp140 trimers and assessed the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of Ad prime, Env gp140 trimer boost regimens against SIVmac251 and SHIV-SF162P3 challenges in rhesus monkeys. Vector prime, protein boost vaccine regimens induced higher titer binding and neutralizing antibodies compared with protein only regimens. Clinical studies to evaluate Ad26/MVA and Ad26/ protein vaccine regimens are planned.

116 Strategies and mechanisms for vaccine induction of mucosal T cell immunity
Jay A. Berzofsky Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, US
Most HIV transmission is through mucosal surfaces. We previously found in mice that CD8 T cells must be in the local mucosa to prevent mucosal viral transmission. Intrarectal delivery was most effective, but not so practical. We devised a strategy to mimic intrarectal delivery through the oral route by encapsulating antigens in nanoparticles enclosed in microparticles that protected against stomach acid and enzymes and released the nanoparticles in the large intestine for update by dendritic cells. Different formulations resulted in selective release in the small or large intestine and T cell immunity in those sites, revealing a heretofore unknown subcompartmentalization between the small and large intestinal mucosal immune system. Delivery to the colon mimicked intrarectal delivery for protection of mice against intrarectal vaccinia virus challenge. We translated this to macaques, showing similar selective delivery and some preliminary evidence of efficacy in a SHIV intrarectal challenge model. The subcompartmentalization also implies that the homing receptors for T cells to traffic to the small and large intestine must differ. We found that indeed, small intestinal DCs induce T cells to home to the small intestine, whereas colonic DCs induce homing to the colon. This difference appears to correlate with different levels of retinoic acid production and differential induction of homing integrins and chemokine receptors. Besides the ability to mimic the benchmark intrarectal immunization by a more acceptable route, such subcompartmentalization may be useful for selective immunization, and understanding the mechanisms involved in homing may allow selective targeting of T cells to the right compartment.

117 30 Years of HIV Vaccine Research
José Esparza Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA, US
Soon after HIV was discovered as the cause of AIDS in 1983-1984, there was an expectation that a preventive vaccine would be rapidly developed. The first HIV vaccine vaccine paradigm was aimed at inducing neutralizing antibodies, with numerous recombinant envelope proteins tested in clinic al trials. It came to an end in 2003, with the negative results from the VaxGen trials in North America and Thailand.
The second paradigm aimed at inducing CD8+ T-cell responses, and it led to the development of DNA vaccines and of live-recombinant viral vectors, especially poxviruses and adenoviruses (Ad). The concept was tested in the STEP and Phambili trials, using an Ad5 vector. The trials were stopped in 2007, after an interim review of STEP showed that the vaccine failed to prevent HIV infection or to decrease virus load in vaccinated volunteers who became infected, and even enhanced HIV acquisition in a subpopulation of vaccinated individuals.
The current wave of vaccine development is attempting to induce more complex immune responses and exploring novel approaches. The RV 144 trial in Thailand, which assessed the protective efficacy of a prime-boost protocol using a canarypox vectors followed by gp120 boosts, showed 31.2% efficacy in preventing HIV acquisition and presumptive immune correlates have been identified. The field is now exploring new leads that include the rational design of novel immunogens based on epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies, live replicationcompetent vectors and the role of potentially protective non-neutralizing antibodies.

118 The dense glycan shield on the HIV envelope: the Achilles heel of the virus?
Jan Balzarini Rega Institute for Medical Research, BE
The envelope gp120 of HIV contains an unusual high amount of N-glycans that serves as a dense shield to hide immunogenic epitopes on gp120 against the immune system. There exists a wide variety of glycan-binding agents with different specificities to recognize carbohydrate moieties present on the HIV envelope. Several of the carbohydrate-binding agents (CBA) are potent inhibitors of at least four different pathways of HIV to infect virus-susceptible cells and to be transmitted to virus-exposed individuals. These CBAs have been demonstrated (i) to inhibit cell-free virus infection of CD4+ T-lymphocytes and macrophages, (ii) to block syncytia formation between persistently HIV-infected (gp120-expressing) cells and uninfected cells, (iii) to prevent virus capture by DCSIGN-expressing cells and (iv) to block transmission of DC-SIGN-captured virus particles to uninfected CD4+ T-lymphocytes. CBAs represent the only agents reported to be able to concomitantly interact with these four processes, which can be advantageous from a microbicide perspective. Interestingly, CBA drug pressure in cell culture forces the virus to select for mutant variants that have multiple N-glycan deletions in their envelope, and thus, to uncover immunogenic epitopes on gp120. Accumulation of such envelope mutations compromises the infectivity of the virus. Several gp120 antibodies show a markedly increased activity against such mutant viruses. CBAs may, therefore, represent an entirely novel therapeutic concept in that they inhibit virus entry into its susceptible cells, and prevent DC-SIGN-directed virus transmission, but in addition, they may trigger the host immune system as soon as drug-related (N-glycan) mutations appear in the viral envelope.

119 The Anti-HIV Drug Pipeline
John G. Bartlett Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, US
New Drugs by Class NRTI: Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) is the pro-drug of tenofovir with advantages of slight increase activity and reduced renal/bone toxicity. The phase 2 trial (Zolopa A. 2012 CROI, Abstr 99LB) compared TAF vs. another TDF prodrug (TFV, each with EFV, COBI/ FTC in 170 treatment naïve patients. At 24 weeks both groups achieved VL <50 c/mL; TAF showed better renal and bone safety. InSTI: Dolutgravir (DTG) - New once daily DTG/2NRTIs that shows potency with good activity vs. RAL-resistant strains. · S/GSK 1265-744 ("744"): This is a next generation InSTI with a T1/2 of 21-50d! NNRTI: MK1439 - This new potent NNRTI showed exceptional potency with 25 mg monotherapy once daily (Anderson M, 2013 CROI;Abstr. 100). · RPV-LA: A novel nanosuspension of RPV with steady state release after 600 mg given SC or IM every 3 months. Entry Inhibitors: Cenicriviroc (CVC) antagonizes CCR5 receptor, but also CCR-2 receptors to possibly reduce immune activation. ART activity is comparable to EFV. · BMS 663068 (or BMS 068): This is a prodrug of BMS529 that binds gp125 to prevent HIV binding to CD4 cells. A small trial showed 42 of 48 treatment-naïve patients responded; the 6 exceptions had a genetic factor that accounted for nonresponse. Pharmacoenhancer: Cobicistat (COBI) is a potential substitute for RTV to boost ARVs and is already FDAapproved in combination as EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC.

121 Progress, achievements and challenges: a review of China's free antiretroviral therapy program
Fujie Zhang National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, CN
In order to respond to the rapid emergence of a large number of AIDS cases and subsequent peak of death in the early 2000's, Chinese government launched its National Free ART Program in 2002. The initial stage of this program mainly focused on former plasma donors at six provinces in central China under the China Comprehensive AIDS Response Program. Since the release of "Four Free and One Care" policy in late 2003, the ART program was quickly scaled up to the whole country and had covered 64% of individuals knows to have AIDS by the end of 2006. As more resources became available, second line drugs, free viral load and free resistance tests became parts of routine services successively between 2007 and 2010, which represented the standardization of China's ART program. Due to the encouraging findings of ART's both survival and prevention benefits, China's ART program stepped into a phase of fast expanding. The sum of newly treated patients in 2011 and 2012 almost equal the accumulative sum of the previous nine years. By the end of 2015, this program aims to treat 358,600 HIV/AIDS patients in China. With the fast expansion of the program, China successfully decreased the overall mortality of HIV from 39.3 per 100 personyears in 2002 to 14.2 per 100 person-years in 2009. Progress indicators also suggested improvement at implementation. However, there are many challenges remain, which in long run may threaten the sustainability and effectiveness of the program. More attention should be paid to the groundwork of the program and more efforts should be made to improve the overall capacity of the program and its related systems.

123 New HIV Therapies
James F Rooney, Michael Miller, Andrew Cheng Gilead Sciences, US
The advent of triple drug highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996 was a turning point in the battle to control HIV disease. For the first time, HIV replication could be effectively limited resulting in marked improvements in morbidity and mortality from HIV infection. However, the treatment regimens were complex with patients having to take many pills at different times during the day, and the regimens were associated with significant long term side effects. Subsequent treatment strategies have focused on simplification of dosing to facilitate adherence and better tolerated regimens. Various combination pills were developed beginning with Combivir ( zidovudine/ lamivudine) given twice daily and then Truvada (tenofovir DF/emtricitabine) given once daily in combination with a third or fourth drug. This led to the development of single tablet regimens (STR), a single pill that provided complete therapy for treatment of HIV infection. The first STR was Trizivir (zidovudine/ lamivudine/abacavir) given twice daily, which was followed by the once daily STRs Atripla ( tenofovir DF/emtricitabine/efavirenz), Complera (tenofovir DF/emtricitabine/rilpivirine), and Stribild (tenofovir DF, emtricitabine, cobicistat, elvitegravir), which are now the most commonly used medications for the initial treatment of HIV infection. New drugs are in development, including the tenofovir prodrug TAF (tenofovir alafenamide fumarate) and the integrase inhibitor dolutegravir, which may offer advantages in safety, efficacy, and simplicity of dosing, and could be included in future STRs.

124 Male-to-Female HIV-1 Transmission: Lessons from Ex Vivo
Leonid Margolis National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NIH, US
The mechanisms of male-to-female HIV-1 transmission mediated by semen are not well-understood. To decipher these mechanisms, we developed a system of cervico-vaginal tissue ex vivo to which HIV-1 is transmitted from semen under controlled laboratory conditions. Semen samples obtained from HIV-1infected and control men were analyzed for the presence of 21 cytokines, and HIV-1 transmission was simulated ex vivo by deposition on cervico-vaginal explants of virus suspended in semen or in PBS enriched with particular cytokines. In HIV-1-infected men, the cytokine spectrum was significantly changed, resulting in the establishment of new correlations and the strengthening of pre-existing correlations between different cytokines: HIV-1 infection increases the number of such correlations from 21 to 72. These changes in semen were local and different from ones in blood from the same individuals. One of the most upregulated seminal cytokines was IL-7, which enhanced replication of HIV-1 in cervico-vaginal tissue. This enhancement was associated with the suppression of apoptosis as evaluated from the expression of apoptotic markers, a decrease in the depletion of infected cells as evaluated from flow cytometry, and an increase in cell cycling as evaluated from Ki67 staining.
In conclusion, HIV-1 establishes new strong correlations between various cytokines, thus imposing a high rigidity on their network that may contribute to the impaired capacity of the immune system to respond to microbial challenges. Seminal cytokines, in particular IL-7, may be key determinants of HIV-1 transmission from men to their uninfected female partners through vaginal intercourse and may become a new target for preventive and therapeutic strategies.

125 Progress Toward A Cure for HIV
Alain Lafeuillade General Hospital, Toulon, FR
Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has dramatically increased life expectancy during HIV infection but must be taken life-long. Consequently, it carries problems of compliance, resistance, toxicity and cost. Finding a cure against HIV would resolve these issues. In theory, it could be either a "functional" or a "sterilizing" cure, but its main goal would be to keep HIV replication at bay without continuing cART. A couple of situations already exist where this has been achieved:
-The Berlin patient who is free of cART more than 5 years following an allogenic bone marrow transplant from a donor with the delta 32 mutation on the CCR5 gene;
-The "Mississippi child" who received cART within 31 hours after birth;
-The "VISCONTI" patients who received cART at acute HIV infection and remained aviremic when this therapy was stopped a few years later;
-Two patients who received allogenic stem cell transplantation for lymphomas and have no trace of HIV, although cART is still continued.
Developing therapeutic strategies toward a HIV cure needs a deep understanding of the mechanisms that allow HIV persistence in reservoirs despite cART. Using current knowledge, approaches trying to purge the HIV reservoir have reached clinical trials using vorinostat. These trials showed the need of more potent activators combined with an immunologic intervention to eliminate cells where latent HIV has been activated. However, as the HIV reservoir is probably more complex than initially thought, others strategies than reactivation have to be pursued, including gene therapy.

126 Questions and challenges in HIV drug resistance: A molecular perspective
Luis Menéndez-Arias Centro de Biología Molecular "Severo Ochoa" (CSICUAM), ES
The introduction of potent combination therapies in the mid-90s had a tremendous impact on AIDS mortality. However, drug resistance has been a major factor contributing to antiretroviral therapy failure. At present, reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors constitute the backbone of successful antiretroviral therapies. The HIV1 RT is a heterodimer composed of subunits of 560 and 440 amino acids. Mutations in the RT-coding region selected during treatment with nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) confer resistance by altering discrimination between NRTIs and natural substrates (dNTPs), or by conferring a phosphorolytic activity (dependent on pyrophosphate or ATP) that unblocks the chainterminating inhibitor from the 3´ end of the DNA that is being synthesized. The most relevant mutations conferring resistance to RT inhibitors map within the DNA polymerase domain of the RT (first 260 residues), and this region is subjected to genotypic analysis in order to select the proper antiretroviral treatment.

127 Safety, pharmokinetics and efficacy of VM1500, a novel reverse transcriptase inhibitor, In healthy volunteers and HIV-infected patients
Vadim Bichko, M.D. Viriom Ltd. (Russia)
No abstract provided.

Despite the reasonable knowledge of the correlates between HIV genotype and the virological response to current therapies, our knowledge is still incomplete. The effects of antagonistic mutations and amino acid substitutions outside the DNA polymerase domain of the RT have been poorly characterized and examples will be given to illustrate the complexities of mutational patterns involved in resistance. In addition, I will provide examples of epistatic effects of HIV-1 protease and RT mutations that could affect viral fitness. Finally, an overview of mutational pathways and mechanisms of resistance to novel antiretroviral drugs (e.g. raltegravir, elvitegravir, etravirine, rilpivirine and maraviroc) will be briefly presented.

128 Cure of HBV infection: can APOBEC3 deaminases mediate it?
Ulrike Protzer Technische Universität München / Helmholtz Zentrum München, DE
Current antivirals cannot efficiently control but not eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the 300 million carriers at risk to develop liver diseases and cancer, because HBV establishes a stable nuclear cccDNA in infected hepatocytes. Interferon can clear HBV but therapeutic dosing is limited by side effects. We found a mechanism by which nuclear viral DNA can specifically be degraded. In HBV-infected cells and primary human hepatocytes, human liver-needle biopsies and in vivo mouse models, interferon and even at much lower doses lymphotoxin- -receptor activation up-regulated nuclear APOBEC3 family deaminases. Cytidine-deamination resulted in apurinic/apyrimidinic site formation and finally cccDNA degradation. No deamination was detected in genomic DNA since HBV-core protein targeted the APOBEC3 protein to cccDNA. Inducing nuclear APOBEC3 deaminases e.g. by triggering the lymphotoxin- -receptor pathway will be of high interest for the development of new therapeutics. The combination with existing antivirals shows great promise to eliminate the virus in chronic hepatitis B.

129 Polio Vaccines: The Past, Present and the Future
Konstantin Chumakov FDA Office of Vaccines Research and Review, US
Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and live Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) are among the most successful and widely used vaccines in the history of medicine. The history of their development and subsequent evolution in response to changing epidemiological and socioeconomic circumstances will be reviewed along with new efforts to develop a new generation of polio vaccines. OPV was responsible for virtual elimination of the disease, and its worldwide eradication may be achieved in few years. Paradoxically, this monumental accomplishment demands introduction of a new generation of vaccines specifically designed for the new polio-free world to ensure the lasting success of the eradication campaign. Both current vaccines have their strengths and weaknesses: OPV is inexpensive and easy to administer, but its virus can revert to virulence and cause paralytic disease. IPV is highly efficient and safe but is more expensive, requires several intramuscular injections, and does not induce fully adequate mucosal immunity. New vaccines must combine the best characteristics of both. Lower cost of IPV and broader immune response could be achieved by using adjuvants, alternative routes of administration, and increasing production yield. Production of IPV is associated with biosecurity concerns because it is made from highly virulent strains. Novel approaches to reduce virulence of strains used for IPV manufacture will be discussed. Development of a more genetically stable OPV is underway by attempting to reduce rates of mutations and recombination. Polio vaccines were a paradigm for many other vaccines, and lessons learned from their evolution could help develop other prophylactic products.

130 Reinhard Kurth Honorary Lecture HTLV-I and Adult T Cell Leukemia/ Lymphoma (ATLL) : Cellular and Molecular Basis of Transformation
William W Hall, Hirofumi Sawa and Hideki Hasegawa University College, Dublin, IE; Hokkaido University, Sapporo, JP; National institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, JP
HTLV-I infection is endemic in a number of well defined geographical regions and is associated with the development of ATLL, an aggressive T cell malignancy. While the pathogenesis of ATLL is incompletely understood, the viral regulatory and oncoprotein Tax is considered to play a central role. To better understand the role of Tax and to develop animal models of disease we have generated transgenic mouse models which have remarkably reproduced the clinical, pathological, hematological and molecular features of human disease. Studies on the latter have highlighted the important role of chemokines in the infiltrative and migratory properties of malignant cells, allowed the identification of specific cellular signalling pathways involved and the employment of specific inhibitors as treatment modalities. Treatment responses however have been limited and this can be attributed to the presence of cancer stem cells (CLCs). We will describe the identification and characteristics of the CLCs and demonstrate their important role in disease progression. In addition we will summarise studies employing proteomic approaches to identify unique CLC protein expression profiles which may serve as important targets towards eradicating the CLC population and which might serve as key therapeutics.

131 Replication and assembly of filoviruses
Larissa Kolesnikova, Gordian Schudt, Olga Dolnik, and Stephan Becker Institut für Virologie, Philipps-Universität Marburg, DE
The family of Filoviridae comprises Marburg and Ebola virus which both cause severe life-threatening diseases characterized by high fever, rash, thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic diathesis. The pathogenesis of the syndrome is not completely understood; probably the dynamic replication of filoviruses in the infected host leads to an uncoordinated immune response. Detailed understanding of the basic mechanisms of filoviral assembly and interaction with host cells is key to identify targets of antiviral intervention. The first sign of filovirus replication that can be detected microscopically in the infected cell is the formation of inclusions in the perinuclear region. Inclusions contain all filoviral nucleocapsid proteins (NP, VP35, VP30, VP24, and L) but also the matrix protein VP40 and a number of cellular proteins. Viral nucleocapsids are formed within the inclusions by specific interactions among the viral proteins. Mature nucleocapsids are transported across the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane with the help of the actin cytoskeleton. In the cell periphery nucleocapsids are associated with the matrix protein and channeled into filopodia, the site of filoviral release. Nucleocapsids inside filopodia are cotransported together with the unconventional motor protein myosin 10. Transport of nucleocapsids and release of viral particles is supported by the cellular ESCRT machinery.

132 A Novel Pathway of Proviral HIV-1 Latency Regulated by Aminoacid Starvation and HDAC4

133 Structural basis for ebolavirus matrix assembly and budding; protein plasticity allows multiple functions

An intrinsic property of all retroviruses is their capacity to establish a state of latent infection in addition to active viral replication. Both genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to silence the integrated provirus and are nowadays targets of experimental approaches aiming at reactivating virus expression in order to kill the infected cells either by immune-mediated mechanisms (such as CTL) or by pharmacological agents. We have recently uncovered an unsuspected pathway triggered by essential aminoacid starvation and involving the downregulation of HDAC4, a class II HDAC, leading to a significant uprising of latent HIV1 infection in chronically infected cell lines, such as ACH-2 cells, expressing this enzyme, but not in similar cell lines, such as U1, negative for HDAC4 expression. Both pharmacological targeting of HDAC4 and siRNAmediated downregulation of its expression gave the same result. A similar phenomenon was observed for heterologous transgenes, driven by different promoters, introduced for gene therapy purposes, but not for their endogenous counterparts. This observation suggests that the mTOR-independent pathway triggered by aminoacid starvation and involving HDAC4 modulation represents or contributes to an intracellular response to foreign nucleic acids (I. Palmisano et al., PNASPlus 2012). More recent results with a broader variety of HIV-1 latency models will be discussed.

Proteins, particularly viral proteins, can be multifunctional, but the mechanism(s) behind this trait are not fully understood. Here, we illustrate through multiple crystal structures, biochemistry and cellular microscopy that the Ebola virus VP40 protein rearranges into different structures, each with a distinct and essential function required for the ebolavirus life cycle. A butterfly-shaped VP40 dimer trafficks to the cellular membrane. There, electrostatic interactions trigger rearrangement of the polypeptide into a linear hexamer. These hexamers construct a multi-layered, filamentous matrix structure that is critical for budding and resembles tomograms of authentic virions. A third structure of VP40, formed by a different rearrangement, is not involved in virus assembly, but instead uniquely binds RNA to regulate viral transcription inside infected cells. These results provide a functional model for ebolavirus matrix assembly and the other roles of VP40 in the virus life cycle, and demonstrate how a single, wild-type, unmodified polypeptide can assemble into different structures for different functions.

134 A cellular restriction factor blocking replication of an emerging bunyavirus in human cells: clues for cross-species barriers?
Mariana Varela, Ilaria Piras, Angela McLees, Catrina Mullan, Frederick Arnaud, Xiaohong Shi, Esther Schnettler, Alain Kohl, Richard Elliott and Massimo Palmarini MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, UK
Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is a novel orthobunyavirus of ruminants that emerged in Europe in the summer of 2011. Although mild clinical signs are observed in infected adult animals, transplacental infection has been associated with the development of congenital malformations, stillbirths and abortions. SBV has spread dramatically across north-western Europe reaching 100% prevalence in some herds. Despite antibodies against SBV being found in a variety of animal species neither human cases nor positive serology in highly exposed humans have been detected. We have recently developed molecular and serological tools, and an experimental in vivo model as a platform to study SBV pathogenesis, tropism and virus-host cell interactions. Specifically we developed a reverse genetics system that aided us in unraveling determinants of virulence.
Here, we report identification of a cellular factor that restricts SBV replication. While the human orthologue restricts SBV replication under different experimental conditions, no restriction is observed by the ovine counterparts. We show that the restriction is specific since SBV replication is restored under the presence of a known viral restriction factor antagonist. We also show that this viral restriction factor and SBV nucleocpasid co-localize at the cell membrane and in the perinuclear region and we partially unravel the mechanism of restriction. Based on these results we hypothesize that the lack of positive human serology to SBV is related to the ability of this cellular factor to restrict SBV replication and we are currently exploring if these findings can be extended to other bunyaviruses.

135 HIV-associated immunodeficiency despite potent antiretroviral therapy with CD4 T cell reconstitution
Bhawna Poonia, Suchita Chaudry, Haishan Li, Cristiana Cairo and C. David Pauza Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, US
CD4 T cell reconstitution in patients with HIV is associated with increased responses to conventional vaccines and improved resistance to opportunistic infections. However, prolonged therapy fails to replenish a capacity for immune control over HIV and patients who interrupt therapy inevitably rebound to pre-treatment viral burden in plasma. Only elite patients, termed NVS or natural virus suppressors (1), control viremia to undetectable levels in the absence of therapy. Our earlier studies on NVS patients showed that this group was distinguished from all other HIV patients by the presence of normal levels of CD56+ V2V2 T cells in blood (2) reflecting reconstitution of the T cell receptor repertoire through new cell synthesis (3). The CD56 marker identifies cytotoxic effector lymphocytes including NK, CD8, T and NKT subsets, but it's function remains unknown. We have now shown persistent depression of CD56 expression on CD8 T cells from HIV+ individuals except for NVS patients where the levels approach those found in normal controls. The CD56+ CD8 T cell subset is highly responsive to stimulus, expresses high levels of perforin/granzyme and the small population remaining in HIV patients on therapy, also express the immune exhaustion marker TIM-3, indicating cells may be lost through an apoptosis mechanism. The persisting defect in CD56 expression for two T cells subsets is consistent with a lack of cytolytic effector function and is present in patients with complete virus suppression for many years due to treatment, long after the T cell population is refreshed by new cell synthesis. The block to lytic effector function may explain why treated patients fail to eradicate viral reservoirs; this mechanism is a key target for new therapies designed to cure HIV disease.

HIV-1 Nef regulates activity of endoplasmic
reticulum chaperone calnexin
Lucas Jennelle1, Ruth Hunegnaw1, Larisa Dubrovsky1, Tatiana Pushkarsky1, Michael L. Fitzgerald2, Dmitri Sviridov3, and Michael Bukrinsky1* 1Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Tropical Medicine, George Washington University, Washington, DC 20037, USA; 2Lipid Metabolism Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA; 3Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia.
HIV-1 Nef promotes viral replication by downmodulating a number of cell surface transmembrane proteins, such as CD4, MHC-I and MHC-II, which are targeted by Nef to various degradation pathways. Nef is also responsible for downregulation of cellular cholesterol transporter ABCA1, and this effect contributes to development of atherosclerosis in HIV infected patients. Surprisingly, in contrast to CD4 and MHC I, to which Nef has to bind to exert downregulation, binding to ABCA1 turned out to be unnecessary for inactivation of ABCA1 by Nef. Here, we identified a novel mechanism by which Nef influences activity of host cell and viral proteins. We show that Nef interacts with an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calnexin, which is essential for folding and maturation of glycosylated proteins. Nef disrupts calnexin interaction with ABCA1, thus impairing functionality of this protein, but increases affinity and enhances interaction of calnexin with gp160, promoting maturation and functionality of viral Env proteins. Knock-down of calnexin lead to reduced fusion activity of HIV-1 envelope and reduced virion infectivity, as well as to defective cholesterol efflux, which is mediated by ABCA1. However, gp160 and ABCA1 interacted with calnexin differently: while gp160 binding to calnexin was dependent on glycosylation, interaction of ABCA1 with calnexin was glycosylationindependent. Therefore, Nef binds to calnexin and stimulates interaction between calnexin and gp160 at the expense of ABCA1 and probably other ER proteins. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for previously unexplained effect of Nef on functionality of ABCA1, and suggest a mechanism for upregulation of HIV infectivity by Nef through stimulation of Env maturation.

Interplay between host defenses and viral
anti-defenses as a major factor of viral
cytopathogenicity
Vadim I. Agol M.P.Chumakov Institute of Poliomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences and A.N.Belozersky Institute of Physical-Chemical Biology, Moscow State University, RU
The prevailing paradigm posits that virus-induced cellular injuries (cytopathic effect, CPE) are caused by hijacking of cellular substrates, energy, and infrastructure by the pathogens for the needs of their reproduction. However, this appears to be not the sole, and even not the most important, mechanism of cellular pathology triggered by viral infections. There is ground to believe that the most severe harm may come not from viral reproduction as such but rather from (miscalculated) host defenses as well as from viral anti-defensive activities. The experiments to be presented strongly support this notion. By using as a model system HeLa cells infected with mengovirus (a strain of encephalomyocarditis virus, a lytic picornavirus), we show that the major signs of CPE caused by this virus can be uncoupled from its reproduction. This can be achieved by partial mutual disarmament of the virus (by mutational inactivation of one of its anti-defensive "security" proteins, the leader protein) and the host (by chemical inhibition of one of its defensive innate immunity mechanisms, apoptosis). Under such conditions, the appearance of major cellular injuries is postponed until well after the completion of the viral reproduction. Remarkably, a more profound disarmament of the virus (by additional deletion of its second security protein, 2A) accompanied with a marked suppression of the viral reproduction leads to a faster death of the infected apoptosis-deficient cells due primarily to their defensive suicidal programmed necrosis. Thus, efficient strategies to ameliorate virus-induced injuries may include measures aimed at suppression of not only viral reproduction or viral anti-host functions but also of host defenses

138 Understanding protective immunity: Lessons from measles
Wen-Hsuan Lin and Diane E. Griffin Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, US
Measles is the poster child for establishment of life long immunity to re-infection. This is associated with a prolonged persistence of measles virus (MeV) RNA in blood and lymphoid tissue. The live attenuated vaccine is also effective, but the immune responses are less robust and of somewhat shorter duration than after natural infection. Through study of a variety of experimental DNA and virus-vectored vaccines in rhesus macaques followed by wild type MeV challenge, we have identified 4 levels of protective immunity: 1) protection from both rash and viremia; 2) protection from rash, but not viremia; 3) protection from rash and viremia, but not infection; 4) no protection with possibility of enhanced disease. Protection from rash requires high levels of high avidity MeV neutralizing antibody, but this is not sufficient to protect from viremia. MeV-specific T cells alone do not protect from rash or viremia, but lead to more rapid clearance of MeV RNA from blood. Antibody and T cell responses to the hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) surface glycoproteins protect from rash and viremia, but not infection leading to late appearance of viral RNA in blood. Parenteral or deep lung respiratory delivery of the live virus vaccine protects against rash, viremia and infection. Further studies are needed to determine if experimental vaccines require additional antigens or induction of a different type of immune response to recapitulate the protection provided by the live attenuated vaccine virus and natural infection.

Aedes aegypti mosquito control is currently the only option for controlling and preventing epidemic dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever. However, current approaches for vector control are not stemming the rising tide of dengue disease throughout the tropical world. In the absence of a vaccine, new and effective approaches are needed to improve vector control. Novel approaches to prevent dengue virus transmission will be described and discussed, including 1) the Casa Segura approach to prevent dengue transmission in the home, 2) development of a new generation of molecular mosquitocides to address the rise of resistance to existing insecticides, and 3) engineering dengue virus resistant mosquitoes. There is a public health imperative to increase the armamentarium for vector control.

140 Reversing the Epidemic of HIV-1C in Southern Africa with Treatment as Prevention
M. Essex Harvard School of Public Health, US
The epidemic of HIV-1C in southern Africa is characterized by a sustained prevalence that is substantially higher than for other epidemics of HIV/ AIDS. Perhaps the best correlate of transmission is high viral load (HVL), which we target to prevent spread of HIV in a community randomization trial based on antiretroviral treatment (ART) as prevention (TasP). Designed for over 100,000 adults in 30 randomized villages in Botswana, this trial also utilizes other prevention interventions such as HIV testing, male circumcision, clinical linkage and ART chemoprophylaxis during pregnancy. Viral phylogenetics is used to estimate the proportion of incident infections originating in test villages, and thus the relative contribution of TasP for preventing transmissions. Analysis of results through modeling includes estimating cost effectiveness and estimations of contributions for different prevention interventions.

As genome wide association studies plus whole genome sequence analyses for complex human disease determinants are expanding, it seems useful to develop strategies to facilitate large data sharing, rapid replication and validation of provocative statistical associations that straddle the threshold for genome wide significance. At this conference, we shall announce GWATCH, (Genome Wide Association Tracks Chromosome Highway) a web based data release platform that can freely display and inspect unabridged genome tracked association data without compromising privacy or Informed Consent constrictions, allowing for rapid discovery and replication opportunities. We illustrate the utility with HIV-AIDS resistance genes screened in combined large multicenter cohort studies GWAS (MACS, HGDS, MHGS, ALLIVE , LSOCA HOMER) developed and studied over the last decades.

142 Sochi virus as a highly pathogenic and life-threatening agent

143 Rift Valley fever virus: A virus with potential for global emergence
Janusz T. Paweska Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory Service, ZA

A new genotype of Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV), Sochi virus, was found in the Black Sea field mouse, Apodemus ponticus. This mouse is naturally occurring in the Southern European Russia and transcaucasian countries between the Black and the Caspian Sea. Recently, cell culture isolates of Sochi virus have been generated from A. ponticus and an HFRS patient with fatal outcome.
At the present state of knowledge, Sochi virus seems to be the most dangerous representative of DOBV. Virus diagnostics in patients was accomplished by immunofluorescence assay, serotyping of neutralizing antibodies, and RT-PCR amplification of viral genome segments. In phylogenetic analyses we found a spatial clustering of the viral nucleotide sequences derived from patients and mice trapped at different localities of the Russian Black Sea coast region demonstrating Sochi virus as the causal pathogenic agent in humans. We currently oversee in detail the clinical courses of 51 patients with confirmed Sochi virus infection. The case fatality rate was determined to be as high as 14%. Nearly 60% of clinical courses were defined as severe (including deaths) and nearly 40% as moderate. Four times more males than females were affected. Quite unusual for hantavirus disease, also young people became ill due to Sochi virus infection; 10% of patients were found between 7 and 15 years old and the age average of all patients was not much higher than 30 years.
There is an urgent need to monitor the epidemiology of the new virus - not only because of its healththreatening character in this particular geographical area but also because of its potential ability to overcome host species barriers. Colonization of nearly related host species, as A. flavicollis or A. sylvaticus, by the virus could dramatically increase its geographical spread and consequently further enhance the danger for the human population.

The capacity of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) to spread into new territories by crossing significant natural geographic barriers, re-emerge in endemic regions after long periods of silence to cause large outbreaks in human and animal populations constitute a formidable challenge for public and veterinary health authorities as well as for scientific communities worldwide. In spite of recent advances in research on RVFV pathogenesis, molecular epidemiology, outbreak prediction, development of new diagnostic tools and vaccines, some fundamental aspects of the epidemiology and ecology of the virus remain elusive. Large outbreaks of RVF are associated with anomalous high rainfalls leading to massive flooding and the resultant swarms of competent mosquito vectors transmitting the virus to a wide range of susceptible vertebrate species. However, the exact mechanism of RVFV natural transmission during interepizootic periods remains largely unknown, including the postulated long-term virus persistence in transovarially infected eggs of floodwater Aedes mosquito species, and the role of wild mammals as reservoirs. The presence of competent mosquito vectors in countries free of RVF, the wide range of mammals susceptible to the virus, the global changes in climate, and increased animal trade and travel are some of the factors which might contribute to international spread. This presentation provides the background to the major outbreaks, molecular biology and epidemiology of RVFV, and overviews aspects of ecology, host and vector range which make the virus a potential global emerging threat.

145 Arbovirus and related infection disease in China
Guodong Liang National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC
Arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) are maintained in nature in cycles involving hematophagous arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes, midges, ticks and susceptible vertebrate hostshuman or animals. At present, more than 550 arboviruses have been identified, among which are more than 130 virus species that can cause disease in susceptible vertebrate hosts. Today, Dengue fever, West Nile virus disease, and Rift valley fever etc. still outbreak in the worldwide. Study of arboviruses not only becomes the important topics of virology, but also appears to be a social problem directly related with the public health.
Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), Dengue Virus (DENV), Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) (also known as Xinjiang Hemorrhagic Fever Virus in Chinese, XHFV), and Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus (TBEV) are the four principal arboviruses of public health importance in mainland China at present.
There is a growing body of evidence indicating that other arboviruses are present and causing human infections and disease in China. Over the past years, an investigation of arbovirus has been carried out in China, across the country, to learn more about arboviruses, or viruses spread by insects. The various specimens with a total number of 897, 369 have been collected from 29 provinces of mainland China, including 841, 576 mosquitoes, 16, 315 ticks, 5, 968 sandflies, 960 midges, 436 bats, 2, 309 animal specimens, 18, 579 clinical specimens from patients with fever and viral encephalitis and 13, 380 serum specimens from healthy populations. Total 512 arbovirues strains, belonging to 23 species in 10 genuses of 7 families, were isolated from various specimens, including Flavivirus, Alphavirus, Bunyavirus, dsRNA virus and DNA virus have been identified.

148 HPV, HIV, and Cancer: A Global Challenge
Silvia Franceschi
The seminal discovery that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection causes cervical cancer provides an opportunity for prevention by vaccination and new screening approaches. Approximately 600,000 new cancer cases per year are attributable to HPV worldwide of which about half million in less developed countries (de Martel et al, Lancet Oncology, 2012). These cancers include all cervical cancers, the vast majority of anal cancers and approximately half of cancers of the vulva, vagina, and penis. In the head and neck, HPV is clearly involved in a fraction of cancer of the oropharynx that varies between 10% and 70% by geographic area and the burden of cancer caused by tobacco use. Most HPV infection is harmless and clears spontaneously but persistent infection with high risk HPV (notably type 16) is one of the most powerful human carcinogens. HPV disrupts normal cell cycle control promoting uncontrolled cell division and the accumulation of genetic damage. Two effective prophylactic vaccines composed of HPV-16/18 and HPV-16/18/6/11 virus like particles have been introduced in many developed countries as a primary prevention strategy. HPV testing is clinically valuable for secondary prevention in triaging low grade cytology and as a test of cure following treatment. More sensitive than cytology, primary screening by HPV testing could allow screening intervals to be extended. If these prevention strategies can be implemented in developing countries, many thousands of lives could be saved. HIV-positive individuals are at increased risk of HPV infection and cancer sites associated with HPV. cART and cervical screening may avoid an increase in cervical cancer in sub-Saharan cancer.

149 HCV AND lymphoma: Genetic and epigenetic factors
Zignego AL, Gragnani L, Fognani E, Piluso A Center for Systemic Manifestation of Hepatitis Viruses- University of Florence, IT
Over 180 million people worldwide are chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV infection is a major cause for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), moreover the association with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) like mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) or B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) is undisputed. The mechanisms by which HCV contributes to LPD development are still poorly understood. Available data suggest that the viral infection may induce LPDs through a multifactorial and multistep process that involves the sustained activation of B cells, the abnormal and prolonged B cell survival, and genetic and/or epigenetic factors.
Concerning genetic factors, different authors reported an association between specific HLA clusters or B-cell activating factor promoter genotype and a higher risk of developing MC and lymphoma. In addition, the results of a large, ongoing genome wide association study (GWAS) will probably allow the identification of specific genetic profile of HCV patients with LPDs.
Furthermore, microRNAs (miRNAs) can give a major contribution to the pathogenesis of several neoplastic, lymphoproliferative diseases and it is conceivable their involvement in the pathogenesis of HCV-related LPDs. We recently showed that specific miRNAs were differently modulated in PBMCs from HCV patients who developed MC and/or NHL. In addition, HCV patients who developed HCC, showed a differential miRNAs regulation.

15th Annual International Meeting of the Institute of Human Virology

In conclusion, available data suggest that the genetic/ epigenetic analysis of HCV-related cancerogenesis is of great usefulness in both the pathogenetic and clinical/ translational areas possibly allowing the definition of diagnostic/prognostic markers for early detection of lymphatic or hepatic cancer.

150 Carcinogenesis of HPV
Buonaguro FM, Tornesello ML, Annunziata C, Buonaguro L Istituto Naz. Tumori - IRRCS "Fondazione G. Pascale," IT
Human papillomavirus are oncogenic DNA virus able to transform cutaneous and mucosal epithelial cells. The most relevant transforming mechanisms is the down-regulation of two oncosuppressor genes: p53 and pRb. For their frequency of detection in invasive lesions some genotypes have been defined "high risk" and their carcinogenicity has been referred to (a) their capacity to induce persistent infections, for the efficacy to escape the host immune system, (b) the binding affinity of their E6/E7 oncoprotein to the respective oncosuppressors, and (c) their efficacy to induce genomic instability. In vivo risk of cancer progression, in particular transition from pre-invasive to invasive cancer lesions, and the subsequent frequency of developing metastatic lesions as well as responsivity to anticancer treatment, is due to specific virus-host interactions and genomic damages. As paradigm the better prognosis and higher responsivity to treatment of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers in comparison to HPV-negative cancers. Mutations in genes of the apoptotic pathway, particularly the TP53 gene, have been analyzed in cervical cancers. A significant higher mutation frequency of TP53 gene in the CAC adenocarcinoma (32 of 241; 13.3%) compared to SCC squamous cell carcinoma (39 of 657; 5.9%; P=0.0003, (2) test) has been identified. Three codons (175, 248 and 273) were the most commonly mutated in both, codon 249 mainly in SCC, codon 282 only in CAC. The G to A and C to T transitions were the prevalent type of mutations in both SCC and CAC (48.7% and 53.5% of all mutations, respectively). The frequency of C to A transversion was relatively high only in CAC (25%), while the mirror mutation G to T was comparatively frequent in SCC (14.6%).

151 Using genomics to search for new viral causes and treatments for human cancer
Patrick S. Moore, Yuan Chang American Cancer Society Professor, Cancer Virology Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, US
Although animal polyomaviruses, such as SV40, have been critical models in cancer research for over one-half century, polyomaviruses have not-until recently--been linked to human cancer. Using digital transcriptome subtraction, Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) was discovered in 2008 to infect most Merkel cell carcinomas, the most severe form of skin cancer. Normally, MCV is an common and asymptomatic infection of the human skin. In Merkel cell tumors, however, the virus integrates and undergoes mutations that eliminate viral replication but allow continued expression of viral oncogenes. MCV and MCC reveal a new model for carcinogenesis in which a rare combination of xenomutations to healthy skin flora initiate a deadly cancer. Using new sequencing technologies, the causes previouslyunsuspected viral cancers can be uncovered and clues for new rational drug therapies can be designed.

152 Insights into the pathogenesis of HHV8driven body cavity-based lymphoma

Human herpesvirus 8 is associated with the development of primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), an aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma characterized by the proliferation of the malignant lymphocytes almost exclusively in large serous cavities. The mechanisms involved in the preferential tropism for serous cavities and in the aggressive course of PEL remain to be fully clarified. To study the role of host microenvironment in PEL progression, we previously compared the antineoplastic activity of a murine interferon -expressing lentiviral vector (mIFN-LV) to that of a human IFN- -LV in a murine model of peritoneal PEL. We demonstrated that in vivo targeting of the murine microenvironment showed an antineoplastic activity comparable to that observed with the hIFN- -LV. These findings highlighted the relevant role of body cavity environment in PEL growth and indicated that modulation of microenvironment may impair PEL growth in vivo. By using cocultures of PEL cell lines with human mesothelial cells (HMC), we mimicked the interactions existing in body cavities to analyze the mechanisms involved in PEL progression. PEL cells induced a myofibroblastic morphology in HMC, paralleled by an expression profile indicative of the occurrence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, HMC increased proliferation and resistance to apoptosis of PEL cells. These data indicate that PEL cells induce EMT in HMC and fibrosis of serous membranes. In turn, HMC modulate PEL cell turnover, thus providing a milieu favorable to PEL progression. These findings open new perspectives into the mechanisms involved in PEL progression and may indicate new targets for PEL treatment.

153 Molecular pathogenesis by HTLV-1 bZIP factor
Masao Matsuoka Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, JP
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) mainly transmits by cell-to-cell contact. Therefore, this virus induces proliferation of infected cells to facilitate transmission. In HTLV-1 infected individuals, infected cells proliferate in vivo. This proliferation of infected cells leads to the development of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and inflammatory diseases including HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (HAM). HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) is consistently expressed in ATL cells and HTLV-1 infected cells, and plays a critical role in their proliferation. Transgenic expression of HBZ causes T-cell lymphoma and inflammatory diseases, indicating that HBZ is critical for the pathogenesis of HTLV-1.
We analyzed the function of HBZ and found that it possessed opposite functions to Tax in many pathways. We found that Tax could activate the classical Wnt pathway while HBZ inhibited it by interacting with TCF1/LEF1. The canonical Wnt pathway is activated in the thymus, and its transcription factors, TCF1/ LEF1, suppressed the viral gene transcription by Tax. Conversely, the canonical Wnt pathway is suppressed in the peripheral T cells in which the non-canonical Wnt pathway is activated. HBZ enhanced the expression of Wnt5a, which is a ligand in non-canonical Wnt signaling. Knockdown of Wnt5a suppressed the proliferation and migration of ATL cells. Thus, activation of the non-canonical Wnt pathway by HBZ is linked with proliferation of ATL cells.
These findings suggest that HTLV-1 is adapted to, not thymic T cells, but peripheral T cells. HBZ modulates the intracellular environment suitable for HTLV-1 replication and proliferation of infected cells.

154 Responding to the challenge of AIDS Associated Cancers in Nigeria
Dr. William Blattner and Clement Adebamowo
The stabilization of the HIV epidemic in Africa has uncovered new epidemic of HIV associated comorbidities including cancers which the poorly developed health care system, poor infrastructure and lack of personnel is unable to cope with. In November 2012, international leaders in Cancer Research and Policy from 15 countries met at the NIH, Bethesda and made recommendations about the interventions needed to respond to the global cancer challenge in the world. These include (a) Creation of reliable, population-based registries that define the incidence, mortality, and survival rates of different types of cancers (b) Implementation of prevention measures to mitigate factors now known to promote cancer--tobacco, certain infectious agents, ultraviolet radiation, alcohol, obesity, lack of exercise, and diet, (c) Screening individuals for certain cancers (of the cervix, breast, prostate, and colorectum, in particular) and (d) Optimal cancer treatment. In this presentation, I will highlight how the Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland (IHV) and the Institute of Human Virology Nigeria (IHVN) working with partners in Nigeria and internationally have implemented these recommendations and present data illustrating the outcome of our interventions. For example, Since 2010, 21 cancer registries have been developed or re-strengthened in Nigeria and 3 of these have met the WHO criteria for population based cancer registration (PBCR). These registries are now able to contribute data to the global cancer incidence database after more than 30 years during which there was no data from Nigeria. With mainstreaming of an additional 3 PBCR this year, we would have increased the proportion of Africa covered by PBCR from 11% to 32%. Our results also correct distortions in the estimates of cancer incidence and mortality in Nigeria which was previously based on projections derived from data from cancer registries of other African countries that had been used in the past Cervical cancer is the commonest female cancer in Africa and in women living with HIV/AIDS. Implementation of screening programs has reduced incidence in developed countries by 80% in recent decades but incidence in developing countries remain stable or has been increasing. IHV implements an innovative "screen and treat" with immediate treatment with cold coagulation, digital cervicography for QA/QC and web based consultation for second opinion for early detection of cervical cancer. In collaboration with the Nigerian authorities and other partners, this program plans to reach 1,000,000 Nigerian women with at least 1 lifetime screening event over the next 10 years. This screening project laid the foundation for the NIH funded African Collaborative Center for Microbiome and Genomics Research (ACCME), part of the Wellcome Trust and NIH funded H3Africa initiative, which we set up at the IHVN and is currently engaged in integrative epidemiology of cervical cancer that is exploring the host and viral genomics and epigenomics, somatic cervical cancer genomics as part of NIH led Cancer Genome Atlas mapping project (TCGA), vaginal microenvironment - innate immunity and vaginal microbiota, as well as detailed risk factor characterization of prevalent and persistent HPV infection. Preliminary results from early studies conducted at this Center will be presented. Because of dearth of systematic information about the epidemiology of AIDS Associated Cancers in Africa, we have created a matched prospective cohort of persons living with HIV/AIDS and healthy volunteers who are being followed up every 2 years with detailed clinical evaluation and collection of data and biological samples in order to improve knowledge of the epidemiology of HIV Associated Comorbidities and provide high quality biological samples for molecular and omics studies. In my presentation, I will also mention some of the trainings that we have conducted, research into other cancer risk factors and the work we are doing to map the infrastructural needs for oncology treatment in Nigeria.

155 Evolution by Tumor Neofunctionalization and Phenomenon of Tumor Specifically Expressed, Evolutionarily Novel (TSEEN) genes
Andrei P. Kozlov, PhD The Biomedical Center, St. Petersburg (RU)
Earlier I formulated the hypothesis of the possible evolutionary role of tumors. This hypothesis suggests that tumors supply evolving multicellular organisms with extra cell masses for the expression of newly evolving genes. After expression of novel genes in tumor cells, tumors differentiate in new directions and give rise to new cell types, tissues and organs.
In the presentation, the bulk of data supporting the positive evolutionary role of tumors will be reviewed, obtained both in the lab of the author and from the literature sources.
The following issues will be addressed: the widespread occurrence of tumors in multicellular organisms; features of tumors that could be used in evolution; the relationship of tumors to evo-devo; examples of recapitulation of some tumor features in recently evolved organs; the types of tumors that might play the role in evolution; examples of tumors that have played the role in evolution.
The discussion of experimental confirmation of nontrivial predictions of the hypothesis will include the analysis of evolutionary novelty of tumor-specifically expressed EST sequences; ELFNI - AS1, a human gene with possible microRNA function expressed predominantly in tumors and originated in primates; PBOV1, a human gene of the recent de novo origin with predicted highly tumor-specific expression profile; and the evolutionary novelty of human cancer/testis antigen genes.
The conclusion is made that expression of protogenes, evolutionarily young and/or novel genes in tumors might be a new biological phenomenon, a phenomenon of TSEEN (Tumor Specifically Expressed, Evolutionarily New) genes, predicted by the hypothesis of evolution by tumor neofunctionalization.

156 HIV and metabolic disease: Clues to control of HIV infection from the immune and virological response to high dose Vitamin D challenge
Barry Peters Kings College London, UK
Effective use of HAART markedly reduces morbidity and mortality due to classical HIV disease. The 4 key emerging diseases in people with HIV that are amenable to prevention & therapy are Coronary Heart Disease, Renal Disease, Fragility Fractures, Diabetes.
These constitute an increasing burden of morbidity and mortality in HIV uninfected people due to an aging population and are becoming even more prevalent in people with chronic HIV.
The issue is exemplified by fragility fractures, a major cause of mortality in the elderly, and emerging as a manifestation occurring earlier in people with HIV, and increasing in incidence.
The Probono Study from Kings College London demonstrated among 222 patients with matched controls that reported fractures at any site during adulthood occurred more frequently in HIV than controls, 45 (20.3%) vs. 16 (7.2%) (OR=3.27; p=0.0001). Osteoporosis was more prevalent in HIV (17.6% vs. 3.6%, p<0.0001). In HIV, use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), low body mass and serum PTH were significantly related to low BMD in multivariate analysis.
The changing patterns of morbidity and mortality in HIV, driven by the metabolic consequences of HIV infection itself, and the HAART therapy requires development of an appropriate screening and management response.

Pathogenesis of Epstein-Barr Virus-driven
lymphomas of HIV+ patients: new insights
of potential clinical relevance
Riccardo Dolcetti C.R.O. - IRCCS, National Cancer Institute, IT
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)+ patients have an increased risk to develop lymphomas, including a significant fraction of histotypes associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. Although restoration of EBV-specific T-cell function induced by HAART has led to a decreased incidence of the more immunogenic EBV-associated lymphomas, such as immunoblastic and primary central nervous system lymphomas, other EBV+ histotypes are still prevalent in the HAART era, particularly Hodgkin's lymphoma. Therefore, factors other than HIV-induced immune suppression are probably required for the development of EBV-related lymphomas in this setting. Particular attention is being given to the identification of microenvironmental stimuli able to up-regulate critical EBV latency proteins or to induce/enhance EBV replication. In fact, recent evidence indicates that, although latency programs predominate in EBV-driven tumors, lytic EBV replication may also be of pathogenic relevance, at least in the early phases of cell transformation. This is particularly relevant for HIV-related lymphomagenesis since the underlying impairment of immune responses may favour uncontrolled activation of EBV lytic replication in latently-infected B lymphocytes. Available data indicate that local expression of distinct cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-13, may up-regulate the expression of the LMP-1 oncoprotein in B cells, thus favoring lymphomagenesis. In the search of microenvironmental factors that may promote the development of EBV-driven lymphomas in HIV+ patients, we obtained evidence supporting a pathogenic role for HIV matrix protein p17, which accumulates in lymphoid tissues of HIV+ individuals, even during HAART. Our findings support a direct contribution of HIV p17 to the development of EBVdriven lymphomagenesis and may provide the rationale for new strategies of clinical intervention in this setting.

158 Hepatitis C Treatment Update: Current Status and Future Direcctions
Shyam Kottilil National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, US
Hepatitis C virus infection is a major cause of liver disease, with170 million persons infected worldwide. Hepatitis C virus is a ssRNA virus that preferentially infects human hepatocytes. Approximately 80% of HCV infections progress to chronicity, with development of hepatic fibrosis over time with 20% developing cirrhosis within 25 years, and 20% of these developing hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV remains the primary cause of liver transplantation worldwide. Of the 1 million people infected with HIV in the United States, about a third are co-infected with HCV. While cART has dramatically decreased the number of AIDS-related opportunistic infections, HCV- related liver disease has become leading cause of death in this population. HIV/HCV coinfected individuals have an accelerated progression of liver disease and lower therapeutic response rates when compared to their HCV monoinfected counterparts. In light of the higher rates of adverse events observed with current treatment in HIV/HCV coinfected patients, there remains a need for therapies with improved response rates, convenient dosing schedules, and safety profiles. Currently, the field of HCV therapeutics is evolving to rapidly develop strategies that are highly safe and efficacious for the eradication of HCV without the use of interferon formulations. Directly acting antivirals that target various stages of the HCV life cycle are being developed and will likely revolutionize the management of HCV by simplifying treatment, improving tolerability of regimens, and decreasing duration of therapy while maintaining or increasing rates of SVR. This presentation will discuss the newer therapeutics that are being developed for treating hepatitis C in HIV-infected subjects.

159 Hepatitis B Treatment Update: Current Status and Future Directions
Rohit Talwani Institute of Human Virology, US
The current standard of care for chronic hepatitis B infections entails use of nucleoside/nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors or pegylated interferon. The presentation will:
· Provide an overview of the current standard of care for treatment of chronic HBV in patients with and without HIV co-infection including a review of treatment endpoints in chronic HBV infection
· Explore future directions of HBV treatment including an evaluation of strategies geared toward attaining a functional cure of chronic HBV infection

160 Treatment Strategies to Minimize the Impact of Antiretroviral Drug Toxicities
Bruce Gilliam Institute of Human Virology, US
Treatment success with antiretroviral drug regimens continues to improve. However, as HIV infected patients live longer, the clinician and patient are challenged with managing the complications of numerous co-morbidities and drug toxicities. While some of these problems may not be able to be prevented, the availability of multiple new antiretroviral agents now gives the clinician and patient multiple options to achieve virologic suppression. This raises the question of which combinations of antiretroviral agents have optimal safety and toxicity profiles for the individual patient. The potential implications of the choice and usage of certain antiretroviral agents and regimens and their known and potential advantages and disadvantages/toxicities will be reviewed and the avenues for further investigation will be highlighted. The complexities of managing an HIV infected patient today, including co-morbidities and antiretroviral drug toxicities, suggest that newer treatment strategies which reevaluate the factors and considerations that influence how antiretroviral agents and regimens are chosen may well move away from the currently recommended regimens in the future to attain the goal of minimization of long-term antiretroviral toxicities.

Background: Tanzania with a population of 44.9 million is classified as one of the 22 high burden countries for tuberculosis (TB). The country houses 5,972 health facilities; the majority in urban areas while rural areas have limited access to TB diagnostic services. The TB notification rate for all cases in 2011 was 153/100,000 people with 59/100,000 being smear positive. Nevertheless, the 2013 National TB prevalence survey revealed prevalence of bacteriological confirmed TB was 354/100,000 with the rural areas more affected. The findings signify more TB than reported. TB continues to major driver of mortality in HIV patients, as reported by facilities supported by IHV, with the highest mortality in our HIV project. 20% died while on TB treatment and 73% died with symptoms of TB. Challenges: IHV's program reports a low rate of TB among HIV patients. By June 2013, 20 districts treated 35,502 HIV patients, with only 1% diagnosed with TB; almost half being from 4 districts with the TB intervention project. The result is likely due to insufficient diagnostic services. In some areas, patients travel 100km to access services. More refined diagnostic techniques to increase sensitivity like LED Microscopy, molecular technology, and sputum culture are insufficient which poses particular challenges for HIV/AIDS patients. TB detection activities have primarily remained health facility based endeavors with minimal community involvement. These circumstances do not provide for an optimal environment for increased TB case detection and hence hinders TB control efforts. Interventions: IHV implements a WHO funded TB program in Tanzania to support active intensified case management which has led to finding more TB cases, with 38% of all forms of TB, and 36% Smear and/or bacteriological positive. Our challenge was the inadequacy of sensitive diagnostic facilities, and hence installed one GeneXpert machine which registered an increase of 6.6% TB cases that were missed by fluorescent microscopy. Building on experience gained and lessons learned, IHV plans to impact case detection through the installation of 4 more GeneXpert machines at high prevalence sites which have limited access to diagnosis. Conclusion and Recommendation: Health systems strengthening for laboratory diagnosis and empowering community case identification can result in a marked increase in TB case finding. With the multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis emerging at an alarming rate, support is required to identify and detect suspected cases, improve diagnostic capacity with efficient technology, and improve linkage between diagnostic centers and treatment facilities.

For only the second time in IHV's history, the meeting is convening outside of the Baltimore/Washington DC area. This year we gather in Moscow, a city obviously of deep historical significance and home to stunning architecture, cultural tradition, and the Russian Federation Capitol. Further, uniquely this year, the meeting will include presentations from members of the Global Virus Network, thereby broadening the scope of the meeting. The IHV Annual Meeting has fostered international scientific cooperation since its inception. This year's event recognizes both our commitment to the global fight against HIV/AIDS as well as a focus on several other human viral diseases, and the critical roles played by the scientists, physicians, and public health officials in the Russian Federation. We are pleased to join together for hosting this meeting and believe it will impact the future of research on viral diseases in our countries and throughout our network of collaborating institutions.
This year's open meeting is from Sunday, September 8 through Wednesday, September 12. An outstanding program of Russian and international experts in medical virology will be presented in the Moscow City Meeting Hall. While our major focus continues to be in HIV/AIDS, through the Global Virus Network, we will expand the scope to cover other important human viral diseases including hepatitis, measles, influenza, enterovirus, polio and hemorrhagic fever. For each, we concentrate on the latest developments in antiviral drug treatment or

Moscow Center for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment
The Moscow Center for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment (AIDS Center) of the Moscow Health Department is the main unit of the city service providing HIV prevention and medical treatment services for Moscow citizens living with HIV/AIDS. The center was established based on a department of the Clinical Hospital No. 2 for Infectious Diseases which, since 1985, had started receiving first individuals in the Soviet Union identified as HIV/AIDS positive.
The specialists who provided medical treatment to the first HIV/AIDS positive individuals formed the backbone of the AIDS Center team. Today it employs more than 200 people working in its 7 departments. The AIDS Center receives patients from healthcare institutions who need their HIV-positive diagnosis to be confirmed and be further registered with the Center or those with controversial HIV antibody test results. The Center provides all types of specialist medical treatment to the HIV/AIDS positive people. Patients and their relatives can get consulting, methodological and psychological assistance as well.
The major success of the Center has been the implementation in Moscow medical institutions of a program to reduce the risk of a vertical transmission from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy and birth. It comes to be of particular relevance today when increasing numbers of HIV-positive women decide to have children. The implementation of special innovative prevention programs has lead to more than a six-fold reduction in the probability of an HIV-positive child birth which is now less than 3 percent.
The Center contributes to scientific research, as well as approves and implements new methods of HIV diagnosis and treatment. The AIDS Center coordinates HIV prevention efforts of all Moscow medical facilities and monitors the quality of HIV laboratory diagnosis in Moscow healthcare institutions.

IHV 2013 Lifetime Achievement Award for Scientific Contributions
Vadim I. Agol, MD, PhD, DSc

Vadim I. Agol is a, if not the, number one polio virologist in the world in terms of the basic science of these viruses. He received an MD diploma cum laude from the 1st Moscow Medical School in 1951 and worked for 5 years at the Karaganda Medical Institute. In 1956 he joined the Institute for Poliomyelitis Research in Moscow (now M. P. Chumakov Institute of Poliomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences) as junior researcher and has been associated with this Institute until now (from 1957 as senior researcher, in 1961-2009 as head of Laboratory of Biochemistry, and now as chief researcher at this lab). He received a PhD in 1954 from the first Moscow Medical School and DSc in 1967 from the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences. In 1963 he participated in the organization of the Department of Virology of the Moscow State University, serving there as Docent and in 1969-2012 as Professor. He also established and continues as head of the Department of Virus/Cell Interactions at the Institute of Physical-Chemical Biology of the same University.

His main scientific interests are focused on diverse aspects of molecular and cellular biology of RNA-containing viruses (primarily picornaviruses) such as non-genetic and genetic interactions (co-discovery of complementation between non-enveloped RNA viruses; first biochemical proof of the intermolecular recombination between RNA genomes; demonstration of the existence of the non-replicative mechanism of this process), synthesis of viral proteins (first cell-free system for the faithful translation of picornavirus proteins; structural and functional analysis of translational cis-acting element of picornaviral RNAs; discovery and characterization of non-canonical translation initiation factors required for the synthesis of picornaviral proteins; identification of a protease involved in processing of the viral polyprotein; discovery of picornaviral leader proteins; first translational mapping of the flavivirus genome), replication of viral RNA (first evidence for involvement of host proteins in the synthesis of picornavirus RNA; characterization of viral 2C protein involved in the viral replication; functional and structural characterization of replicative cis-elements of the picornavirus genomes), neurovirulence and attenuation of picornaviruses (first mapping of viral phenotypic traits by recombinational analysis; discovery of dependence of attenuation on modulation of viral translation), cellular response to picornaviral infection (discovery of the ability of picornaviruses to trigger and suppress apoptotic response of the cells; discovery of the ability of picornaviruses to permeabilize the nuclear envelope by different mechanisms; demonstration that major picornavirus-induced cellular damages may be caused by interplay between host defense and viral anti-defenses and may be uncoupled from viral reproduction; proposal on the existence of a distinct set of viral proteins, dubbed security proteins, specifically dedicated to the anti-defensive activities), evolution (roles of changes in attenuation determinants, antigenic properties and recombination in the evolution of vaccine polioviruses; molecular epidemiology of poliomyelitis). He actively participated in the world struggle against polio.

Dr. Agol is an (elected) corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Honorary Scientist of Russia, recipient of the Triumph prize in biology and medicine, foreign member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, and also received other national and international awards.

Apart from numerous scientific publications, Dr. Agol has published four books of poetry and a book containing an autobiographical novel of his father, well known Soviet geneticist and philosopher Israel Agol, and his own autobiography.

101 Biomedical Prevention of HIV/AIDS in Russia
E.V. Karamov and R.M. Khaitov Research Institute of Immunology, Federal Medical and Biological Agency,RU
The epidemic of HIV/AIDS in Russia is currently in its concentrated phase characterized by concomitant coinfections (hepatitides B and C and tuberculosis). Although subtype A1 is dominant, subtype B and CRF 03 (A/B recombinant) are also present. Recent subepidemic eruptions of HIV infection in Siberia/Urals and the Far East have involved A/G recombinant and subtype C, respectively. Approaches to biomedical prevention of HIV/AIDS in Russia include vaccine and microbicide development.
Candidate HIV vaccines have been developed independently by three Russian research centers. In one of them, the conjugated protein-polymer vaccine VICHREPOL, use is made of an original domestic immunoadjuvant polyoxydonium. This candidate, developed in the Institute of Immunology, is currently undergoing a phase II clinical trial.
A broad-coverage screening of natural and synthetic compounds for anti-HIV activity is currently underway in Russia, aiming at identification of chemicals appropriate for pre-exposure prophylaxis and use as microbicides. Unique compositions of antivirals have been developed, as well as nanotechnologybased means of their delivery, the combinations thereof showing significant promise as microbicide preparations.
The presentation will highlight the present state of research on biomedical prevention of HIV/AIDS in Russia.

HIV/AIDS vaccines in Russia: clinical trials
and estimation of acceptance in population

HIV/AIDS vaccines and also PrEP are considered as the most perspective approaches to control HIV/AIDS epidemic. Candidate conjugated polymer-subunit HIV vaccine VICHREPOL, developed in Moscow Institute of Immunology, successfully passed phase I clinical trials and now is at the start of phase II trials. Two other candidate vaccines (DNA-based and viral vectorbased) are also passed phase I trials. Positive effect of vaccination depends of the coverage of population and this coverage depends of vaccine uptake. Estimation of possible uptake of HIV vaccine is very important to provide its further effective application. Pilot investigation of readiness for HIV vaccination in Russia (Moscow region) was performed (416 persons, 254 (61%) - men, 162 (39%) - women, age of 16-55). 60% of respondents were ready for HIV vaccination. 79% of respondents with risk of HIV infection, agreed to be vaccinated vs 48% of those disclaimed the risk of HIV infection. Readiness for HIV vaccination is 20% lower in respondents with children vs childless. In case of 30% vaccine efficacy readiness for vaccination was 3.5 points of 10; in case of 50% efficacy - 5.2 points of 10; 8.8 points of 10 - in case of 90-95% efficacy. Readiness for vaccination also depends from its duration, number of doses in course, possible adverse side effects, mode of vaccination. 20% of respondents agreed only for free vaccination, 45% - for paid vaccination. Readiness for HIV vaccination is lower in general population (60% vs 78%) and in HIV infection risk groups (79% vs 95-97%) in Russia vs some other countries [Suraratdecha et al., 2005]. It is necessary to improve education programs aimed to inform on HIV
vaccines development, its safety and application.

103 Genetic factors defining resistance and susceptibility to HIV/AIDS
Kofiadi IA, Alexeev LP, Khaitov RM FSBI "NRC Institute of Immunology" FMBA of Russia, RU
One of the priorities for fundamental biomedical science is the discovery of the molecular-genetic basis of HIV pathogenesis. The progress in this area widens the possibilities for further improvement of HIV/AIDS prevention and therapy approaches. In this framework we have studied the population distribution of CCR5 rs333, CCR2 rs1799864, SDF1 rs1801157, HCP5 rs2395029, HLA-C rs9264942 and HLA-B*5701 genetic polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to HIV and AIDS and antiviral drugs intolerance among 1120 seronegative individuals comprising 12 ethnically distinct groups inhabiting Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Moldova(Pomors, Russians(Vologda and Pskov region), Belarus, Ukrainians, Gagauz, Udmurts, Tatars, Chechens, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tuvinians). The rs333 variant is represented at most in the population of Pomors. The homozygotes who have significantly lower risk of HIV infection comprising 3% of the population. The least frequency of CCR5 polymorphism was described for Chechens, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tuvinians: 6, 6, 5 and 2% correspondingly. The highest incidence of CCR2 polymorphism was described for Chechens, Kazakhs and Kyrgyz. The other alleles under study did not reveal significant differences in distribution. The protective effect of the studied polymorphisms in CCR5, CCR2,  SDF1 genes is characterized as cumulative. Based on the frequencies of three-loci genotypes we have established the values of relative hazard of AIDS onset and relative hazard of AIDS-caused death for the populations under study. The risks fall in range 0.79-0.94 and 0.76-0.93, correspondingly. We have found that interpopulation genetic variability confers for statistically relevant differences in the hazards estimated.

104 Cell-to-cell transmission of HIV: role of virological synapse
Mazurov DV, Filatov AV Institute of Immunology, RU
HIV-1 infects CD4+ T-lymphocyte by cell free viral particles released from the surface of effector cells or after the formation of intercellular contact between infected cell and healthy lymphocyte. The last way of infection was designated as cell-to-cell viral transmission. The current studies suggest that cell-tocell transmission of HIV occurs in peripheral lymph nodes at the early stage of infection and is more efficient pathway of virus dissemination than cell-free infection. One of the most accepted models of HIV transmission is the formation of virological synapse (VS); tight intercellular adhesion junction sharing structural similarity with immunological synapse. VS forms after HIV surface protein gp120 expressed on the plasma membrane of infected cells in prefusogenic conformation recognizes CD4 receptor on target cell. Viruses transmitted across VS undergo endocytosis by target cells, so that viral entry occurs via endocytic compartments and not via cell surface. This feature of cell-to-cell transmission accounts for the resistance of HIV to the neutralizing antibodies. Although the different stages of HIV cell-to-cell transmission have been extensively studied, the levels of correlation between virus transmission and targets infection were not accurately quantified. To fill up the gap in our understanding of cell-mediated viral infection, we have developed a new methods and improved vectors to quantify the levels of VS formation, cell-to-cell infection, and macromolecular transport across the cell-cell contact. New T cell lines stably producing recombinant virus like particles and reporter RNA, as well as modified target cells were generated.

105 Rationale for HIV vaccines design
Irina A.Nikolaeva, Igor G.Sidorovich National Research Center - The Institute of Immunology of the Federal Medical- Biological Agency, RU
Development of an effective and safe HIV vaccine presents unique challenges. Despite the progress in understanding the biology of HIV-1 and its recognition by the human immune system, we have not yet developed an efficacious HIV-1 vaccine. During the last years, the results were obtained that has given hope that vaccination may prevent HIV-1 acquisition. The results of post-RV144 correlates and sieve analyses suggest that vaccine worked probably involving an immunological mechanism in the second variable loop (V2). A high resolution structure of the envelope trimer was solved, and this information is being used for the design of new generations of vaccines aimed at inducing protective antibodies. New techniques have facilitated the discovery of new human broadly neutralizing antibodies (BrNAbs) that target and delineate diverse conserved epitopes on the envelope glycoprotein spike. The epitopes of these BrNAbs can serve as templates for immunogen design aimed to induce similar antibodies. A separate goal of HIV vaccine research is to identify the best strategy for immunization and delivery agents. Several vectors and adjuvants have been developed. Significant advances have been made towards the development of tools to assess preclinical efficacy and understanding the correlates of protection in non human primate models. We observe the preventive potential of microbicides, PrEP, and earlier antiretroviral treatment of infected individuals has been demonstrated. All of these interventions may have a significant impact in reducing the incidence of HIV infections. However a safe and efficacious vaccine will be the most efficient way to control global HIV-1 pandemic, and scientific opportunities look promising.

107 The modern methods for HIV/AIDS vaccine evaluation
S.V. Korobova, I.G. Sidorovich, G.V. Kornilaeva FSBI "NSC Institute of Immunology" FMBA of RU
The spread of HIV/AIDS increases worldwide, a safe and efficacious vaccine remains the cornerstone for a prevention strategy to stop HIV-1 epidemic. Both humoral (neutralizing antibodies) and cellular (CTL) responses are able to control HIV infection. Non-neutralizing HIV-specific antibodies could play an important role in preventing or controlling HIV infection. These antibodies can bind to infected cells and recruit innate immune effector cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, to lyse infected cells through antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibodydependent cell-mediated virus inhibition (ADCVI). The measurement of immune responses directed specifically against the HIV is critical for understanding the interplay between the virus and the host immune system. By characterizing the immunological correlates of protection against HIV infection, such measurements will aid in the development of efficacious prophylactic vaccine. To improve vaccine antigens and adjuvant, it is also necessary to asses a similarity of vaccine - and virus - induced immune responses The evaluation of antigenspecific humoral response includes measurement amount and specificity of vaccine-induced antibodies (in ELISA or WB), their neutralizing activity and ADCC or ADCVI. ELISPOT, intracellular cytokine flow cytometry assays and Luminex are the most common assays to determine CTL response. They all determine immune response by the detection of the cytokines (IFNgamma, TNF-alpha, IL2) secreted by cells upon antigenstimulation. MHC tetramer binding assay measures the absolute number of cells that recognize a particular epitope without providing any information regarding the functionality of the cells.

108 Development of universal vaccines against flu: reality and prospects
Shmarov M.M. Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, RU
Two surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are the main antigens for obtaining traditional flu vaccines due to their high immunogenicity and ability to induce generation of neutralizing antibodies. High genetically instability of influenza virus provides antigenic diversity of these glycoproteins between strains. Subunit vaccines based on one of these surface antigens are characterized by narrow specificity. Modern vaccines should provide protection against several or all subtypes of influenza A viruses. In addition sporadic influenza outbreaks of newly emerged influenza A viruses may cause the next pandemic.
Today there are no flu vaccines of a wide range of action, so-called "universal" vaccines. Several flu vaccines with a broad cross-protectivity are tested in different phases of clinical trials.
In this report the analysis of the modern researches directed on creation of flu "universal" vaccines including data obtained by researchers of Gamaleya institute of epidemiology and microbiology is carried out.
Genetic immunization technology is used for development of "universal" vaccine. Recombinant pseudoadenoviral particles coding of influenza virus conservative antigens were used as a vector for gene delivery. Polypeptide, containing hemagglutinin conservative epitopes, was used in addition to traditional influenza conservative antigens M1, M2 and NP. Animal experiments demonstrated that developed vaccines were very efficient against different influenza subtypes (80%-100% survivability).

109 Problems and prospects of development of the subunit TB vaccine

110 Broadly neutralizing antibodies for serotherapy and vaccine design
Antonio Lanzavecchia Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Bellinzona and Institute of Microbiology, DE

Tuberculosis (TB) causes about 1.4 million deaths each year. Currently the only licensed anti-tuberculosis vaccine is Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). This live attenuated vaccine has been in use for over 80 years and has displayed up to 80% efficacy against serious forms of the disease, e.g., meningitis, in children. However, efficacy in adults against pulmonary tuberculosis ranges from 0 to 80% in different trials. The protective immunity generated by BCG decreases with time, and almost disappears after 20-25 years, resulting in a vulnerability of the adult population to primary infection and reactivation of latent TB. Thus, development of an effective preventive vaccine and new "post-infection" vaccine are still important aims of vaccinology.
In this study we report the development of novel subunit protein-based vaccine against tuberculosis. Our vaccine consists of two recombinant mycobacterium proteins - Ag85A and fusion protein ESAT6-CFP10. These antigens are strongly recognized by T cells and they have demonstrated protective efficacy in animal models. However, because the protein component of the subunit vaccine is poorly immunogenic, the recombinant protein vaccine was adjuvanted with novel, three-component adjuvant system composed of the dextran, cationic DEAEdextran and oligodeoxynucleotide CpG. This adjuvant was chosen on the basis of its ability to induce strong protective immunity in animal models of M. tuberculosis infection, by delivering a TLR9 ligand into the endosomal pathway. Recombinant vaccine proteins possess dextranbinding domain, which helps create «depot» effect and provide prolonged interaction of vaccine antigen with T-cells.

Memory B lymphocytes and long-lived plasma cells represent a repository of the antigenic experience of an individual. By analyzing the specificity and function of these cells we can gain insights into the human immune response to pathogens and vaccines, identify correlates of protection, and isolate neutralizing antibodies and protective T cells. To interrogate human memory B cell and plasma cell repertoires we developed two culture-based high-throughput methods that are used to isolate, with high efficiency, human monoclonal antibodies of distinctive specificities. Unusually potent neutralizing antibodies against human cytomegalovirus were isolated from infected donors and used to identify the viral ligands and to design an experimental vaccine. We also isolated antibodies of exceptional breadth, such as a pan-influenza A neutralizing antibody and an antibody that neutralizes both respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus. By targeting conserved structures, these broadly neutralizing antibodies are less prone to select escape mutants and are therefore promising candidates for prophylaxis and therapy of infections as well as tools for the design of improved subunit vaccines.

We investigated immunogenicity and protection properties of our vaccine on mice and guinea pigs models of tuberculosis, and also performed toxicity studies. We demonstrated that our subunit vaccine stimulates th1 immune response and is protective against tuberculosis with the same efficacy as BCG. Furthermore, our vaccine showed good result in toxicity studies in mice, guinea pigs
and rabbits.

111 Update on dengue vaccines
Alexander C. Schmidt GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, US
Forty percent of the world's population is at risk for dengue, and 100 million apparent infections are estimated to occur annually. In a minority of cases, dengue fever progresses to severe disease at the time of defervescence, inducing a capillary leak syndrome accompanied by thrombocytopenia that can result in shock and organ failure. Thus the medical need for a dengue vaccine is obvious. The four dengue virus serotypes are transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, and protective immunity against the infecting serotype (homotypic immunity) is long lived and thought to be conferred by virus-neutralizing antibodies and some T cell help. However, antibodies induced by one serotype often cross-react with the other serotypes. If antibodies fail to neutralize and instead opsonize, they can enable the virus to infect IgG receptorbearing cells. This phenomenon, termed antibodydependent enhancement, is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of severe dengue, and is of concern to vaccine developers. Several investigational dengue vaccines are currently in clinical development, and many different vaccination approaches are being explored. These span from live-attenuated dengue viruses to chimera between yellow fever and dengue viruses, to subunit, DNA, and whole virus inactivated vaccines. A recent Phase 2b study of the vaccine most advanced in development did not show statistically significant protection against disease due to any serotype, adding much uncertainty to the entire field. Our understanding of the contributions of humoral and cell mediated responses to protection and to pathogenesis is clearly less than perfect, and selection, presentation and adjuvantation of antigens need thought and attention.

112 The Development of Enterovirus 71 Vaccine
Li Xiuling, Zhang Zhongyang, Wang Xiaoxiao, Hao Chunsheng, Li Yi, Zhang Chong, Zhang Chen, Chen Ming, Ning haijing, Liu Yu, Chen Lei, Ma Shuhua, Yang Yongjuan, Song Dongmei, Shen Xinliang National Vaccine & Serum Institute, CN
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major cause of epidemic outbreaks of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide. The virus belongs to the family Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus. 3 genotypes--A, B, and Cand more than 10 sub-genotypes have been identified. After the initial identification of this virus in 1969, some large outbreaks of HFMD have been reported worldwide.
EV71-induced HFMD is usually characterized by the formation of maculopapular or vesicular lesions on the skin and oral mucosa, especially on the palms, soles, and mouth.. There were a greater number of fatal cases with brainstem encephalitis, pulmonary edema and/or hemorrhage, and cardiopulmonary collapse.
Developing effective vaccines is considered a top choice among all control measures. We evaluated the ability of inactivated virus vaccine to elicit neutralizing antibody and to provide protection against lethal infection of EV71 in suckling mice. The purity of EV71 vaccine was up to 96.8% by HPLC identification. The purified EV71 vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies, these antibodies were shown to be protective against lethal infection when passively transferred to susceptible newborn mice. With a challenge dose of 50LD50 virus/ mouse, suckling mice born to dams immunized with inactivated virus showed 100% survival. In preliminary animal trial, no side effects were detected when monkeys were immunized with purified EV71 vaccine either at normal or large doses.
The vaccine was approved of the clinical evaluation in 2009. The phase 1/2/3 clinical trail was completed in March, 2013. The data suggested that the inactivated EV71 vaccine had a clinically acceptable safety profile and good immunogenicity in healthy children and infants. Our data indicated that inactivated EV71 vaccine is the choice of vaccine preparation capable of fulfilling the demand for effective control.

113 Epidemics of Acute Gastroenteritis Caused by Viruses and Vaccine Development in China
Shen Shuo Wuhan Institute of Biological Product, China National Biotec Group (CNBG), CN
The leading etiological agents of viral gastroenteritis are group A rotaviruses, noroviruses, adenoviruses (type 40, 41) and astroviruses in China in the last 20 years. The prevailing serotypes of rotaviruses are G type 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9, while G8 has been emerged recently in China. Accordingly, trivalent and hexavalent vaccines are under development by the two Institutes under CNBG. The trivalent oral vaccines are reassortants of VP4 and VP7 genes of human strains and other backbone genes of Lanzhou lamb rotavirus (LLR). The safety of lamb rotavirus vaccine strain has been proved since licensing in 2000 in China. The phase 3 clinical trials of the trivalent vaccines are in the progress in Henan province, China. The hexavalent oral vaccines are reassortants of VP7 genes of human strains and the other genes of UK strain, developed by and collaborated with NIH, USA, and PATH. The preclinical studies at Wuhan Institute of Biological Product have been completed and the hexavalent vaccine is ready for phase 1 clinical study. The novoviruses are increasingly detected in epidemics of acute viral gastroenteritis and spontaneous cases of people of all ages in China, including the rapid spreading of the newly emerged pandemic GII.4 variant (Sydney strain 2012) to China. The new Sydney strains were isolated in different areas and analysis of complete sequence demonstrated the rapid evolution. The surveillances and epidemic studies of these emerging viruses support the development of vaccines against the infections caused by noroviruses. The new variant co-circulated with other genotypes of GI and GII genogroups in human and multiple valent vaccines may needed to be developed..

114 VLPs and particle vaccines
Luigi Buonaguro, MD Ist. Naz.Tumori "Fond. G. Pascale," IT
VLPs represent a powerful tool for vaccine development, representing the closest strategy to the native viruses for displaying and delivering conformational epitopes, with improved induction of antibodies and immune response in its whole. Moreover, the lack of genetic material makes VLPs the "safer counterpart" of live attenuated or killed viral vaccines which, indeed, may induce limited but possible undesired effects.
VLP-based vaccines have been developed from both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses to target infectious and non-infectious diseases and are in various stages of development spanning preclinical evaluation to market. In particular, the only two preventive cancer vaccines licensed are based on VLP approach (HBV and HPV vaccines).
Overall, pre-clinical and clinical trials with different VLP-based vaccines have shown they are well tolerated and can be administered by a number of routes, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, oral or intranasal. VLP vaccines have also been demonstrated to be highly immunogenic and capable of stimulating protective immunity in a number of instances when administered with or without adjuvants. Their potent immunogenicity is a result of several factors, including the ability to incorporate key immunogenic properties of viruses into a single entity and to hit the cells relevant for initiate an effective adaptive immune response.

We have previously reported the protective efficacy of Ad26/MVA vector regimens expressing SIVsmE543 Env/Gag/Pol antigens against SIVmac251 challenge. Here we assess the potential utility of adding a protein trimer boost to adenovirus based vaccine regimens. We produced stable SIV and HIV Env gp140 trimers and assessed the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of Ad prime, Env gp140 trimer boost regimens against SIVmac251 and SHIV-SF162P3 challenges in rhesus monkeys. Vector prime, protein boost vaccine regimens induced higher titer binding and neutralizing antibodies compared with protein only regimens. Clinical studies to evaluate Ad26/MVA and Ad26/ protein vaccine regimens are planned.

116 Strategies and mechanisms for vaccine induction of mucosal T cell immunity
Jay A. Berzofsky Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, US
Most HIV transmission is through mucosal surfaces. We previously found in mice that CD8 T cells must be in the local mucosa to prevent mucosal viral transmission. Intrarectal delivery was most effective, but not so practical. We devised a strategy to mimic intrarectal delivery through the oral route by encapsulating antigens in nanoparticles enclosed in microparticles that protected against stomach acid and enzymes and released the nanoparticles in the large intestine for update by dendritic cells. Different formulations resulted in selective release in the small or large intestine and T cell immunity in those sites, revealing a heretofore unknown subcompartmentalization between the small and large intestinal mucosal immune system. Delivery to the colon mimicked intrarectal delivery for protection of mice against intrarectal vaccinia virus challenge. We translated this to macaques, showing similar selective delivery and some preliminary evidence of efficacy in a SHIV intrarectal challenge model. The subcompartmentalization also implies that the homing receptors for T cells to traffic to the small and large intestine must differ. We found that indeed, small intestinal DCs induce T cells to home to the small intestine, whereas colonic DCs induce homing to the colon. This difference appears to correlate with different levels of retinoic acid production and differential induction of homing integrins and chemokine receptors. Besides the ability to mimic the benchmark intrarectal immunization by a more acceptable route, such subcompartmentalization may be useful for selective immunization, and understanding the mechanisms involved in homing may allow selective targeting of T cells to the right compartment.

117 30 Years of HIV Vaccine Research
José Esparza Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA, US
Soon after HIV was discovered as the cause of AIDS in 1983-1984, there was an expectation that a preventive vaccine would be rapidly developed. The first HIV vaccine vaccine paradigm was aimed at inducing neutralizing antibodies, with numerous recombinant envelope proteins tested in clinic al trials. It came to an end in 2003, with the negative results from the VaxGen trials in North America and Thailand.
The second paradigm aimed at inducing CD8+ T-cell responses, and it led to the development of DNA vaccines and of live-recombinant viral vectors, especially poxviruses and adenoviruses (Ad). The concept was tested in the STEP and Phambili trials, using an Ad5 vector. The trials were stopped in 2007, after an interim review of STEP showed that the vaccine failed to prevent HIV infection or to decrease virus load in vaccinated volunteers who became infected, and even enhanced HIV acquisition in a subpopulation of vaccinated individuals.
The current wave of vaccine development is attempting to induce more complex immune responses and exploring novel approaches. The RV 144 trial in Thailand, which assessed the protective efficacy of a prime-boost protocol using a canarypox vectors followed by gp120 boosts, showed 31.2% efficacy in preventing HIV acquisition and presumptive immune correlates have been identified. The field is now exploring new leads that include the rational design of novel immunogens based on epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies, live replicationcompetent vectors and the role of potentially protective non-neutralizing antibodies.

118 The dense glycan shield on the HIV envelope: the Achilles heel of the virus?
Jan Balzarini Rega Institute for Medical Research, BE
The envelope gp120 of HIV contains an unusual high amount of N-glycans that serves as a dense shield to hide immunogenic epitopes on gp120 against the immune system. There exists a wide variety of glycan-binding agents with different specificities to recognize carbohydrate moieties present on the HIV envelope. Several of the carbohydrate-binding agents (CBA) are potent inhibitors of at least four different pathways of HIV to infect virus-susceptible cells and to be transmitted to virus-exposed individuals. These CBAs have been demonstrated (i) to inhibit cell-free virus infection of CD4+ T-lymphocytes and macrophages, (ii) to block syncytia formation between persistently HIV-infected (gp120-expressing) cells and uninfected cells, (iii) to prevent virus capture by DCSIGN-expressing cells and (iv) to block transmission of DC-SIGN-captured virus particles to uninfected CD4+ T-lymphocytes. CBAs represent the only agents reported to be able to concomitantly interact with these four processes, which can be advantageous from a microbicide perspective. Interestingly, CBA drug pressure in cell culture forces the virus to select for mutant variants that have multiple N-glycan deletions in their envelope, and thus, to uncover immunogenic epitopes on gp120. Accumulation of such envelope mutations compromises the infectivity of the virus. Several gp120 antibodies show a markedly increased activity against such mutant viruses. CBAs may, therefore, represent an entirely novel therapeutic concept in that they inhibit virus entry into its susceptible cells, and prevent DC-SIGN-directed virus transmission, but in addition, they may trigger the host immune system as soon as drug-related (N-glycan) mutations appear in the viral envelope.

119 The Anti-HIV Drug Pipeline
John G. Bartlett Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, US
New Drugs by Class NRTI: Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) is the pro-drug of tenofovir with advantages of slight increase activity and reduced renal/bone toxicity. The phase 2 trial (Zolopa A. 2012 CROI, Abstr 99LB) compared TAF vs. another TDF prodrug (TFV, each with EFV, COBI/ FTC in 170 treatment naïve patients. At 24 weeks both groups achieved VL <50 c/mL; TAF showed better renal and bone safety. InSTI: Dolutgravir (DTG) - New once daily DTG/2NRTIs that shows potency with good activity vs. RAL-resistant strains. · S/GSK 1265-744 ("744"): This is a next generation InSTI with a T1/2 of 21-50d! NNRTI: MK1439 - This new potent NNRTI showed exceptional potency with 25 mg monotherapy once daily (Anderson M, 2013 CROI;Abstr. 100). · RPV-LA: A novel nanosuspension of RPV with steady state release after 600 mg given SC or IM every 3 months. Entry Inhibitors: Cenicriviroc (CVC) antagonizes CCR5 receptor, but also CCR-2 receptors to possibly reduce immune activation. ART activity is comparable to EFV. · BMS 663068 (or BMS 068): This is a prodrug of BMS529 that binds gp125 to prevent HIV binding to CD4 cells. A small trial showed 42 of 48 treatment-naïve patients responded; the 6 exceptions had a genetic factor that accounted for nonresponse. Pharmacoenhancer: Cobicistat (COBI) is a potential substitute for RTV to boost ARVs and is already FDAapproved in combination as EVG/COBI/TDF/FTC.

121 Progress, achievements and challenges: a review of China's free antiretroviral therapy program
Fujie Zhang National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, CN
In order to respond to the rapid emergence of a large number of AIDS cases and subsequent peak of death in the early 2000's, Chinese government launched its National Free ART Program in 2002. The initial stage of this program mainly focused on former plasma donors at six provinces in central China under the China Comprehensive AIDS Response Program. Since the release of "Four Free and One Care" policy in late 2003, the ART program was quickly scaled up to the whole country and had covered 64% of individuals knows to have AIDS by the end of 2006. As more resources became available, second line drugs, free viral load and free resistance tests became parts of routine services successively between 2007 and 2010, which represented the standardization of China's ART program. Due to the encouraging findings of ART's both survival and prevention benefits, China's ART program stepped into a phase of fast expanding. The sum of newly treated patients in 2011 and 2012 almost equal the accumulative sum of the previous nine years. By the end of 2015, this program aims to treat 358,600 HIV/AIDS patients in China. With the fast expansion of the program, China successfully decreased the overall mortality of HIV from 39.3 per 100 personyears in 2002 to 14.2 per 100 person-years in 2009. Progress indicators also suggested improvement at implementation. However, there are many challenges remain, which in long run may threaten the sustainability and effectiveness of the program. More attention should be paid to the groundwork of the program and more efforts should be made to improve the overall capacity of the program and its related systems.

123 New HIV Therapies
James F Rooney, Michael Miller, Andrew Cheng Gilead Sciences, US
The advent of triple drug highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996 was a turning point in the battle to control HIV disease. For the first time, HIV replication could be effectively limited resulting in marked improvements in morbidity and mortality from HIV infection. However, the treatment regimens were complex with patients having to take many pills at different times during the day, and the regimens were associated with significant long term side effects. Subsequent treatment strategies have focused on simplification of dosing to facilitate adherence and better tolerated regimens. Various combination pills were developed beginning with Combivir ( zidovudine/ lamivudine) given twice daily and then Truvada (tenofovir DF/emtricitabine) given once daily in combination with a third or fourth drug. This led to the development of single tablet regimens (STR), a single pill that provided complete therapy for treatment of HIV infection. The first STR was Trizivir (zidovudine/ lamivudine/abacavir) given twice daily, which was followed by the once daily STRs Atripla ( tenofovir DF/emtricitabine/efavirenz), Complera (tenofovir DF/emtricitabine/rilpivirine), and Stribild (tenofovir DF, emtricitabine, cobicistat, elvitegravir), which are now the most commonly used medications for the initial treatment of HIV infection. New drugs are in development, including the tenofovir prodrug TAF (tenofovir alafenamide fumarate) and the integrase inhibitor dolutegravir, which may offer advantages in safety, efficacy, and simplicity of dosing, and could be included in future STRs.

124 Male-to-Female HIV-1 Transmission: Lessons from Ex Vivo
Leonid Margolis National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NIH, US
The mechanisms of male-to-female HIV-1 transmission mediated by semen are not well-understood. To decipher these mechanisms, we developed a system of cervico-vaginal tissue ex vivo to which HIV-1 is transmitted from semen under controlled laboratory conditions. Semen samples obtained from HIV-1infected and control men were analyzed for the presence of 21 cytokines, and HIV-1 transmission was simulated ex vivo by deposition on cervico-vaginal explants of virus suspended in semen or in PBS enriched with particular cytokines. In HIV-1-infected men, the cytokine spectrum was significantly changed, resulting in the establishment of new correlations and the strengthening of pre-existing correlations between different cytokines: HIV-1 infection increases the number of such correlations from 21 to 72. These changes in semen were local and different from ones in blood from the same individuals. One of the most upregulated seminal cytokines was IL-7, which enhanced replication of HIV-1 in cervico-vaginal tissue. This enhancement was associated with the suppression of apoptosis as evaluated from the expression of apoptotic markers, a decrease in the depletion of infected cells as evaluated from flow cytometry, and an increase in cell cycling as evaluated from Ki67 staining.
In conclusion, HIV-1 establishes new strong correlations between various cytokines, thus imposing a high rigidity on their network that may contribute to the impaired capacity of the immune system to respond to microbial challenges. Seminal cytokines, in particular IL-7, may be key determinants of HIV-1 transmission from men to their uninfected female partners through vaginal intercourse and may become a new target for preventive and therapeutic strategies.

125 Progress Toward A Cure for HIV
Alain Lafeuillade General Hospital, Toulon, FR
Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has dramatically increased life expectancy during HIV infection but must be taken life-long. Consequently, it carries problems of compliance, resistance, toxicity and cost. Finding a cure against HIV would resolve these issues. In theory, it could be either a "functional" or a "sterilizing" cure, but its main goal would be to keep HIV replication at bay without continuing cART. A couple of situations already exist where this has been achieved:
-The Berlin patient who is free of cART more than 5 years following an allogenic bone marrow transplant from a donor with the delta 32 mutation on the CCR5 gene;
-The "Mississippi child" who received cART within 31 hours after birth;
-The "VISCONTI" patients who received cART at acute HIV infection and remained aviremic when this therapy was stopped a few years later;
-Two patients who received allogenic stem cell transplantation for lymphomas and have no trace of HIV, although cART is still continued.
Developing therapeutic strategies toward a HIV cure needs a deep understanding of the mechanisms that allow HIV persistence in reservoirs despite cART. Using current knowledge, approaches trying to purge the HIV reservoir have reached clinical trials using vorinostat. These trials showed the need of more potent activators combined with an immunologic intervention to eliminate cells where latent HIV has been activated. However, as the HIV reservoir is probably more complex than initially thought, others strategies than reactivation have to be pursued, including gene therapy.

126 Questions and challenges in HIV drug resistance: A molecular perspective
Luis Menéndez-Arias Centro de Biología Molecular "Severo Ochoa" (CSICUAM), ES
The introduction of potent combination therapies in the mid-90s had a tremendous impact on AIDS mortality. However, drug resistance has been a major factor contributing to antiretroviral therapy failure. At present, reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors constitute the backbone of successful antiretroviral therapies. The HIV1 RT is a heterodimer composed of subunits of 560 and 440 amino acids. Mutations in the RT-coding region selected during treatment with nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) confer resistance by altering discrimination between NRTIs and natural substrates (dNTPs), or by conferring a phosphorolytic activity (dependent on pyrophosphate or ATP) that unblocks the chainterminating inhibitor from the 3´ end of the DNA that is being synthesized. The most relevant mutations conferring resistance to RT inhibitors map within the DNA polymerase domain of the RT (first 260 residues), and this region is subjected to genotypic analysis in order to select the proper antiretroviral treatment.

127 Safety, pharmokinetics and efficacy of VM1500, a novel reverse transcriptase inhibitor, In healthy volunteers and HIV-infected patients
Vadim Bichko, M.D. Viriom Ltd. (Russia)
No abstract provided.

Despite the reasonable knowledge of the correlates between HIV genotype and the virological response to current therapies, our knowledge is still incomplete. The effects of antagonistic mutations and amino acid substitutions outside the DNA polymerase domain of the RT have been poorly characterized and examples will be given to illustrate the complexities of mutational patterns involved in resistance. In addition, I will provide examples of epistatic effects of HIV-1 protease and RT mutations that could affect viral fitness. Finally, an overview of mutational pathways and mechanisms of resistance to novel antiretroviral drugs (e.g. raltegravir, elvitegravir, etravirine, rilpivirine and maraviroc) will be briefly presented.

128 Cure of HBV infection: can APOBEC3 deaminases mediate it?
Ulrike Protzer Technische Universität München / Helmholtz Zentrum München, DE
Current antivirals cannot efficiently control but not eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the 300 million carriers at risk to develop liver diseases and cancer, because HBV establishes a stable nuclear cccDNA in infected hepatocytes. Interferon can clear HBV but therapeutic dosing is limited by side effects. We found a mechanism by which nuclear viral DNA can specifically be degraded. In HBV-infected cells and primary human hepatocytes, human liver-needle biopsies and in vivo mouse models, interferon and even at much lower doses lymphotoxin- -receptor activation up-regulated nuclear APOBEC3 family deaminases. Cytidine-deamination resulted in apurinic/apyrimidinic site formation and finally cccDNA degradation. No deamination was detected in genomic DNA since HBV-core protein targeted the APOBEC3 protein to cccDNA. Inducing nuclear APOBEC3 deaminases e.g. by triggering the lymphotoxin- -receptor pathway will be of high interest for the development of new therapeutics. The combination with existing antivirals shows great promise to eliminate the virus in chronic hepatitis B.

129 Polio Vaccines: The Past, Present and the Future
Konstantin Chumakov FDA Office of Vaccines Research and Review, US
Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and live Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) are among the most successful and widely used vaccines in the history of medicine. The history of their development and subsequent evolution in response to changing epidemiological and socioeconomic circumstances will be reviewed along with new efforts to develop a new generation of polio vaccines. OPV was responsible for virtual elimination of the disease, and its worldwide eradication may be achieved in few years. Paradoxically, this monumental accomplishment demands introduction of a new generation of vaccines specifically designed for the new polio-free world to ensure the lasting success of the eradication campaign. Both current vaccines have their strengths and weaknesses: OPV is inexpensive and easy to administer, but its virus can revert to virulence and cause paralytic disease. IPV is highly efficient and safe but is more expensive, requires several intramuscular injections, and does not induce fully adequate mucosal immunity. New vaccines must combine the best characteristics of both. Lower cost of IPV and broader immune response could be achieved by using adjuvants, alternative routes of administration, and increasing production yield. Production of IPV is associated with biosecurity concerns because it is made from highly virulent strains. Novel approaches to reduce virulence of strains used for IPV manufacture will be discussed. Development of a more genetically stable OPV is underway by attempting to reduce rates of mutations and recombination. Polio vaccines were a paradigm for many other vaccines, and lessons learned from their evolution could help develop other prophylactic products.

130 Reinhard Kurth Honorary Lecture HTLV-I and Adult T Cell Leukemia/ Lymphoma (ATLL) : Cellular and Molecular Basis of Transformation
William W Hall, Hirofumi Sawa and Hideki Hasegawa University College, Dublin, IE; Hokkaido University, Sapporo, JP; National institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, JP
HTLV-I infection is endemic in a number of well defined geographical regions and is associated with the development of ATLL, an aggressive T cell malignancy. While the pathogenesis of ATLL is incompletely understood, the viral regulatory and oncoprotein Tax is considered to play a central role. To better understand the role of Tax and to develop animal models of disease we have generated transgenic mouse models which have remarkably reproduced the clinical, pathological, hematological and molecular features of human disease. Studies on the latter have highlighted the important role of chemokines in the infiltrative and migratory properties of malignant cells, allowed the identification of specific cellular signalling pathways involved and the employment of specific inhibitors as treatment modalities. Treatment responses however have been limited and this can be attributed to the presence of cancer stem cells (CLCs). We will describe the identification and characteristics of the CLCs and demonstrate their important role in disease progression. In addition we will summarise studies employing proteomic approaches to identify unique CLC protein expression profiles which may serve as important targets towards eradicating the CLC population and which might serve as key therapeutics.

131 Replication and assembly of filoviruses
Larissa Kolesnikova, Gordian Schudt, Olga Dolnik, and Stephan Becker Institut für Virologie, Philipps-Universität Marburg, DE
The family of Filoviridae comprises Marburg and Ebola virus which both cause severe life-threatening diseases characterized by high fever, rash, thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic diathesis. The pathogenesis of the syndrome is not completely understood; probably the dynamic replication of filoviruses in the infected host leads to an uncoordinated immune response. Detailed understanding of the basic mechanisms of filoviral assembly and interaction with host cells is key to identify targets of antiviral intervention. The first sign of filovirus replication that can be detected microscopically in the infected cell is the formation of inclusions in the perinuclear region. Inclusions contain all filoviral nucleocapsid proteins (NP, VP35, VP30, VP24, and L) but also the matrix protein VP40 and a number of cellular proteins. Viral nucleocapsids are formed within the inclusions by specific interactions among the viral proteins. Mature nucleocapsids are transported across the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane with the help of the actin cytoskeleton. In the cell periphery nucleocapsids are associated with the matrix protein and channeled into filopodia, the site of filoviral release. Nucleocapsids inside filopodia are cotransported together with the unconventional motor protein myosin 10. Transport of nucleocapsids and release of viral particles is supported by the cellular ESCRT machinery.

132 A Novel Pathway of Proviral HIV-1 Latency Regulated by Aminoacid Starvation and HDAC4

133 Structural basis for ebolavirus matrix assembly and budding; protein plasticity allows multiple functions
Zachary Bornholdt, Takeshi Noda, Dafna Abelson, Peter Halfmann, Malcolm Wood, Yoshihiro Kawaoa, Erica Ollmann Saphire The Scripps Research Institute, California, US

An intrinsic property of all retroviruses is their capacity to establish a state of latent infection in addition to active viral replication. Both genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to silence the integrated provirus and are nowadays targets of experimental approaches aiming at reactivating virus expression in order to kill the infected cells either by immune-mediated mechanisms (such as CTL) or by pharmacological agents. We have recently uncovered an unsuspected pathway triggered by essential aminoacid starvation and involving the downregulation of HDAC4, a class II HDAC, leading to a significant uprising of latent HIV1 infection in chronically infected cell lines, such as ACH-2 cells, expressing this enzyme, but not in similar cell lines, such as U1, negative for HDAC4 expression. Both pharmacological targeting of HDAC4 and siRNAmediated downregulation of its expression gave the same result. A similar phenomenon was observed for heterologous transgenes, driven by different promoters, introduced for gene therapy purposes, but not for their endogenous counterparts. This observation suggests that the mTOR-independent pathway triggered by aminoacid starvation and involving HDAC4 modulation represents or contributes to an intracellular response to foreign nucleic acids (I. Palmisano et al., PNASPlus 2012). More recent results with a broader variety of HIV-1 latency models will be discussed.

Proteins, particularly viral proteins, can be multifunctional, but the mechanism(s) behind this trait are not fully understood. Here, we illustrate through multiple crystal structures, biochemistry and cellular microscopy that the Ebola virus VP40 protein rearranges into different structures, each with a distinct and essential function required for the ebolavirus life cycle. A butterfly-shaped VP40 dimer trafficks to the cellular membrane. There, electrostatic interactions trigger rearrangement of the polypeptide into a linear hexamer. These hexamers construct a multi-layered, filamentous matrix structure that is critical for budding and resembles tomograms of authentic virions. A third structure of VP40, formed by a different rearrangement, is not involved in virus assembly, but instead uniquely binds RNA to regulate viral transcription inside infected cells. These results provide a functional model for ebolavirus matrix assembly and the other roles of VP40 in the virus life cycle, and demonstrate how a single, wild-type, unmodified polypeptide can assemble into different structures for different functions.

134 A cellular restriction factor blocking replication of an emerging bunyavirus in human cells: clues for cross-species barriers?
Mariana Varela, Ilaria Piras, Angela McLees, Catrina Mullan, Frederick Arnaud, Xiaohong Shi, Esther Schnettler, Alain Kohl, Richard Elliott and Massimo Palmarini MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, UK
Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is a novel orthobunyavirus of ruminants that emerged in Europe in the summer of 2011. Although mild clinical signs are observed in infected adult animals, transplacental infection has been associated with the development of congenital malformations, stillbirths and abortions. SBV has spread dramatically across north-western Europe reaching 100% prevalence in some herds. Despite antibodies against SBV being found in a variety of animal species neither human cases nor positive serology in highly exposed humans have been detected. We have recently developed molecular and serological tools, and an experimental in vivo model as a platform to study SBV pathogenesis, tropism and virus-host cell interactions. Specifically we developed a reverse genetics system that aided us in unraveling determinants of virulence.
Here, we report identification of a cellular factor that restricts SBV replication. While the human orthologue restricts SBV replication under different experimental conditions, no restriction is observed by the ovine counterparts. We show that the restriction is specific since SBV replication is restored under the presence of a known viral restriction factor antagonist. We also show that this viral restriction factor and SBV nucleocpasid co-localize at the cell membrane and in the perinuclear region and we partially unravel the mechanism of restriction. Based on these results we hypothesize that the lack of positive human serology to SBV is related to the ability of this cellular factor to restrict SBV replication and we are currently exploring if these findings can be extended to other bunyaviruses.

135 HIV-associated immunodeficiency despite potent antiretroviral therapy with CD4 T cell reconstitution
Bhawna Poonia, Suchita Chaudry, Haishan Li, Cristiana Cairo and C. David Pauza Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, US
CD4 T cell reconstitution in patients with HIV is associated with increased responses to conventional vaccines and improved resistance to opportunistic infections. However, prolonged therapy fails to replenish a capacity for immune control over HIV and patients who interrupt therapy inevitably rebound to pre-treatment viral burden in plasma. Only elite patients, termed NVS or natural virus suppressors (1), control viremia to undetectable levels in the absence of therapy. Our earlier studies on NVS patients showed that this group was distinguished from all other HIV patients by the presence of normal levels of CD56+ V2V2 T cells in blood (2) reflecting reconstitution of the T cell receptor repertoire through new cell synthesis (3). The CD56 marker identifies cytotoxic effector lymphocytes including NK, CD8, T and NKT subsets, but it's function remains unknown. We have now shown persistent depression of CD56 expression on CD8 T cells from HIV+ individuals except for NVS patients where the levels approach those found in normal controls. The CD56+ CD8 T cell subset is highly responsive to stimulus, expresses high levels of perforin/granzyme and the small population remaining in HIV patients on therapy, also express the immune exhaustion marker TIM-3, indicating cells may be lost through an apoptosis mechanism. The persisting defect in CD56 expression for two T cells subsets is consistent with a lack of cytolytic effector function and is present in patients with complete virus suppression for many years due to treatment, long after the T cell population is refreshed by new cell synthesis. The block to lytic effector function may explain why treated patients fail to eradicate viral reservoirs; this mechanism is a key target for new therapies designed to cure HIV disease.

HIV-1 Nef promotes viral replication by downmodulating a number of cell surface transmembrane proteins, such as CD4, MHC-I and MHC-II, which are targeted by Nef to various degradation pathways. Nef is also responsible for downregulation of cellular cholesterol transporter ABCA1, and this effect contributes to development of atherosclerosis in HIV infected patients. Surprisingly, in contrast to CD4 and MHC I, to which Nef has to bind to exert downregulation, binding to ABCA1 turned out to be unnecessary for inactivation of ABCA1 by Nef. Here, we identified a novel mechanism by which Nef influences activity of host cell and viral proteins. We show that Nef interacts with an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calnexin, which is essential for folding and maturation of glycosylated proteins. Nef disrupts calnexin interaction with ABCA1, thus impairing functionality of this protein, but increases affinity and enhances interaction of calnexin with gp160, promoting maturation and functionality of viral Env proteins. Knock-down of calnexin lead to reduced fusion activity of HIV-1 envelope and reduced virion infectivity, as well as to defective cholesterol efflux, which is mediated by ABCA1. However, gp160 and ABCA1 interacted with calnexin differently: while gp160 binding to calnexin was dependent on glycosylation, interaction of ABCA1 with calnexin was glycosylationindependent. Therefore, Nef binds to calnexin and stimulates interaction between calnexin and gp160 at the expense of ABCA1 and probably other ER proteins. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for previously unexplained effect of Nef on functionality of ABCA1, and suggest a mechanism for upregulation of HIV infectivity by Nef through stimulation of Env maturation.

Interplay between host defenses and viral
anti-defenses as a major factor of viral
cytopathogenicity
Vadim I. Agol M.P.Chumakov Institute of Poliomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences and A.N.Belozersky Institute of Physical-Chemical Biology, Moscow State University, RU
The prevailing paradigm posits that virus-induced cellular injuries (cytopathic effect, CPE) are caused by hijacking of cellular substrates, energy, and infrastructure by the pathogens for the needs of their reproduction. However, this appears to be not the sole, and even not the most important, mechanism of cellular pathology triggered by viral infections. There is ground to believe that the most severe harm may come not from viral reproduction as such but rather from (miscalculated) host defenses as well as from viral anti-defensive activities. The experiments to be presented strongly support this notion. By using as a model system HeLa cells infected with mengovirus (a strain of encephalomyocarditis virus, a lytic picornavirus), we show that the major signs of CPE caused by this virus can be uncoupled from its reproduction. This can be achieved by partial mutual disarmament of the virus (by mutational inactivation of one of its anti-defensive "security" proteins, the leader protein) and the host (by chemical inhibition of one of its defensive innate immunity mechanisms, apoptosis). Under such conditions, the appearance of major cellular injuries is postponed until well after the completion of the viral reproduction. Remarkably, a more profound disarmament of the virus (by additional deletion of its second security protein, 2A) accompanied with a marked suppression of the viral reproduction leads to a faster death of the infected apoptosis-deficient cells due primarily to their defensive suicidal programmed necrosis. Thus, efficient strategies to ameliorate virus-induced injuries may include measures aimed at suppression of not only viral reproduction or viral anti-host functions but also of host defenses

138 Understanding protective immunity: Lessons from measles
Wen-Hsuan Lin and Diane E. Griffin Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, US
Measles is the poster child for establishment of life long immunity to re-infection. This is associated with a prolonged persistence of measles virus (MeV) RNA in blood and lymphoid tissue. The live attenuated vaccine is also effective, but the immune responses are less robust and of somewhat shorter duration than after natural infection. Through study of a variety of experimental DNA and virus-vectored vaccines in rhesus macaques followed by wild type MeV challenge, we have identified 4 levels of protective immunity: 1) protection from both rash and viremia; 2) protection from rash, but not viremia; 3) protection from rash and viremia, but not infection; 4) no protection with possibility of enhanced disease. Protection from rash requires high levels of high avidity MeV neutralizing antibody, but this is not sufficient to protect from viremia. MeV-specific T cells alone do not protect from rash or viremia, but lead to more rapid clearance of MeV RNA from blood. Antibody and T cell responses to the hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) surface glycoproteins protect from rash and viremia, but not infection leading to late appearance of viral RNA in blood. Parenteral or deep lung respiratory delivery of the live virus vaccine protects against rash, viremia and infection. Further studies are needed to determine if experimental vaccines require additional antigens or induction of a different type of immune response to recapitulate the protection provided by the live attenuated vaccine virus and natural infection.

Dengue vector control: critical needs and
opportunities for helping to control the
dengue pandemic
Barry Beaty Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, Colorado State University, US
Aedes aegypti mosquito control is currently the only option for controlling and preventing epidemic dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever. However, current approaches for vector control are not stemming the rising tide of dengue disease throughout the tropical world. In the absence of a vaccine, new and effective approaches are needed to improve vector control. Novel approaches to prevent dengue virus transmission will be described and discussed, including 1) the Casa Segura approach to prevent dengue transmission in the home, 2) development of a new generation of molecular mosquitocides to address the rise of resistance to existing insecticides, and 3) engineering dengue virus resistant mosquitoes. There is a public health imperative to increase the armamentarium for vector control.

140 Reversing the Epidemic of HIV-1C in Southern Africa with Treatment as Prevention
M. Essex Harvard School of Public Health, US
The epidemic of HIV-1C in southern Africa is characterized by a sustained prevalence that is substantially higher than for other epidemics of HIV/ AIDS. Perhaps the best correlate of transmission is high viral load (HVL), which we target to prevent spread of HIV in a community randomization trial based on antiretroviral treatment (ART) as prevention (TasP). Designed for over 100,000 adults in 30 randomized villages in Botswana, this trial also utilizes other prevention interventions such as HIV testing, male circumcision, clinical linkage and ART chemoprophylaxis during pregnancy. Viral phylogenetics is used to estimate the proportion of incident infections originating in test villages, and thus the relative contribution of TasP for preventing transmissions. Analysis of results through modeling includes estimating cost effectiveness and estimations of contributions for different prevention interventions.

As genome wide association studies plus whole genome sequence analyses for complex human disease determinants are expanding, it seems useful to develop strategies to facilitate large data sharing, rapid replication and validation of provocative statistical associations that straddle the threshold for genome wide significance. At this conference, we shall announce GWATCH, (Genome Wide Association Tracks Chromosome Highway) a web based data release platform that can freely display and inspect unabridged genome tracked association data without compromising privacy or Informed Consent constrictions, allowing for rapid discovery and replication opportunities. We illustrate the utility with HIV-AIDS resistance genes screened in combined large multicenter cohort studies GWAS (MACS, HGDS, MHGS, ALLIVE , LSOCA HOMER) developed and studied over the last decades.

142 Sochi virus as a highly pathogenic and life-threatening agent

143 Rift Valley fever virus: A virus with potential for global emergence
Janusz T. Paweska Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory Service, ZA

A new genotype of Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV), Sochi virus, was found in the Black Sea field mouse, Apodemus ponticus. This mouse is naturally occurring in the Southern European Russia and transcaucasian countries between the Black and the Caspian Sea. Recently, cell culture isolates of Sochi virus have been generated from A. ponticus and an HFRS patient with fatal outcome.
At the present state of knowledge, Sochi virus seems to be the most dangerous representative of DOBV. Virus diagnostics in patients was accomplished by immunofluorescence assay, serotyping of neutralizing antibodies, and RT-PCR amplification of viral genome segments. In phylogenetic analyses we found a spatial clustering of the viral nucleotide sequences derived from patients and mice trapped at different localities of the Russian Black Sea coast region demonstrating Sochi virus as the causal pathogenic agent in humans. We currently oversee in detail the clinical courses of 51 patients with confirmed Sochi virus infection. The case fatality rate was determined to be as high as 14%. Nearly 60% of clinical courses were defined as severe (including deaths) and nearly 40% as moderate. Four times more males than females were affected. Quite unusual for hantavirus disease, also young people became ill due to Sochi virus infection; 10% of patients were found between 7 and 15 years old and the age average of all patients was not much higher than 30 years.
There is an urgent need to monitor the epidemiology of the new virus - not only because of its healththreatening character in this particular geographical area but also because of its potential ability to overcome host species barriers. Colonization of nearly related host species, as A. flavicollis or A. sylvaticus, by the virus could dramatically increase its geographical spread and consequently further enhance the danger for the human population.

The capacity of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) to spread into new territories by crossing significant natural geographic barriers, re-emerge in endemic regions after long periods of silence to cause large outbreaks in human and animal populations constitute a formidable challenge for public and veterinary health authorities as well as for scientific communities worldwide. In spite of recent advances in research on RVFV pathogenesis, molecular epidemiology, outbreak prediction, development of new diagnostic tools and vaccines, some fundamental aspects of the epidemiology and ecology of the virus remain elusive. Large outbreaks of RVF are associated with anomalous high rainfalls leading to massive flooding and the resultant swarms of competent mosquito vectors transmitting the virus to a wide range of susceptible vertebrate species. However, the exact mechanism of RVFV natural transmission during interepizootic periods remains largely unknown, including the postulated long-term virus persistence in transovarially infected eggs of floodwater Aedes mosquito species, and the role of wild mammals as reservoirs. The presence of competent mosquito vectors in countries free of RVF, the wide range of mammals susceptible to the virus, the global changes in climate, and increased animal trade and travel are some of the factors which might contribute to international spread. This presentation provides the background to the major outbreaks, molecular biology and epidemiology of RVFV, and overviews aspects of ecology, host and vector range which make the virus a potential global emerging threat.

145 Arbovirus and related infection disease in China
Guodong Liang National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC
Arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) are maintained in nature in cycles involving hematophagous arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes, midges, ticks and susceptible vertebrate hostshuman or animals. At present, more than 550 arboviruses have been identified, among which are more than 130 virus species that can cause disease in susceptible vertebrate hosts. Today, Dengue fever, West Nile virus disease, and Rift valley fever etc. still outbreak in the worldwide. Study of arboviruses not only becomes the important topics of virology, but also appears to be a social problem directly related with the public health.
Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), Dengue Virus (DENV), Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) (also known as Xinjiang Hemorrhagic Fever Virus in Chinese, XHFV), and Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus (TBEV) are the four principal arboviruses of public health importance in mainland China at present.
There is a growing body of evidence indicating that other arboviruses are present and causing human infections and disease in China. Over the past years, an investigation of arbovirus has been carried out in China, across the country, to learn more about arboviruses, or viruses spread by insects. The various specimens with a total number of 897, 369 have been collected from 29 provinces of mainland China, including 841, 576 mosquitoes, 16, 315 ticks, 5, 968 sandflies, 960 midges, 436 bats, 2, 309 animal specimens, 18, 579 clinical specimens from patients with fever and viral encephalitis and 13, 380 serum specimens from healthy populations. Total 512 arbovirues strains, belonging to 23 species in 10 genuses of 7 families, were isolated from various specimens, including Flavivirus, Alphavirus, Bunyavirus, dsRNA virus and DNA virus have been identified.

148 HPV, HIV, and Cancer: A Global Challenge
Silvia Franceschi
The seminal discovery that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection causes cervical cancer provides an opportunity for prevention by vaccination and new screening approaches. Approximately 600,000 new cancer cases per year are attributable to HPV worldwide of which about half million in less developed countries (de Martel et al, Lancet Oncology, 2012). These cancers include all cervical cancers, the vast majority of anal cancers and approximately half of cancers of the vulva, vagina, and penis. In the head and neck, HPV is clearly involved in a fraction of cancer of the oropharynx that varies between 10% and 70% by geographic area and the burden of cancer caused by tobacco use. Most HPV infection is harmless and clears spontaneously but persistent infection with high risk HPV (notably type 16) is one of the most powerful human carcinogens. HPV disrupts normal cell cycle control promoting uncontrolled cell division and the accumulation of genetic damage. Two effective prophylactic vaccines composed of HPV-16/18 and HPV-16/18/6/11 virus like particles have been introduced in many developed countries as a primary prevention strategy. HPV testing is clinically valuable for secondary prevention in triaging low grade cytology and as a test of cure following treatment. More sensitive than cytology, primary screening by HPV testing could allow screening intervals to be extended. If these prevention strategies can be implemented in developing countries, many thousands of lives could be saved. HIV-positive individuals are at increased risk of HPV infection and cancer sites associated with HPV. cART and cervical screening may avoid an increase in cervical cancer in sub-Saharan cancer.

149 HCV AND lymphoma: Genetic and epigenetic factors
Zignego AL, Gragnani L, Fognani E, Piluso A Center for Systemic Manifestation of Hepatitis Viruses- University of Florence, IT
Over 180 million people worldwide are chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV infection is a major cause for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), moreover the association with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) like mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) or B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) is undisputed. The mechanisms by which HCV contributes to LPD development are still poorly understood. Available data suggest that the viral infection may induce LPDs through a multifactorial and multistep process that involves the sustained activation of B cells, the abnormal and prolonged B cell survival, and genetic and/or epigenetic factors.
Concerning genetic factors, different authors reported an association between specific HLA clusters or B-cell activating factor promoter genotype and a higher risk of developing MC and lymphoma. In addition, the results of a large, ongoing genome wide association study (GWAS) will probably allow the identification of specific genetic profile of HCV patients with LPDs.
Furthermore, microRNAs (miRNAs) can give a major contribution to the pathogenesis of several neoplastic, lymphoproliferative diseases and it is conceivable their involvement in the pathogenesis of HCV-related LPDs. We recently showed that specific miRNAs were differently modulated in PBMCs from HCV patients who developed MC and/or NHL. In addition, HCV patients who developed HCC, showed a differential miRNAs regulation.

15th Annual International Meeting of the Institute of Human Virology

In conclusion, available data suggest that the genetic/ epigenetic analysis of HCV-related cancerogenesis is of great usefulness in both the pathogenetic and clinical/ translational areas possibly allowing the definition of diagnostic/prognostic markers for early detection of lymphatic or hepatic cancer.

150 Carcinogenesis of HPV
Buonaguro FM, Tornesello ML, Annunziata C, Buonaguro L Istituto Naz. Tumori - IRRCS "Fondazione G. Pascale," IT
Human papillomavirus are oncogenic DNA virus able to transform cutaneous and mucosal epithelial cells. The most relevant transforming mechanisms is the down-regulation of two oncosuppressor genes: p53 and pRb. For their frequency of detection in invasive lesions some genotypes have been defined "high risk" and their carcinogenicity has been referred to (a) their capacity to induce persistent infections, for the efficacy to escape the host immune system, (b) the binding affinity of their E6/E7 oncoprotein to the respective oncosuppressors, and (c) their efficacy to induce genomic instability. In vivo risk of cancer progression, in particular transition from pre-invasive to invasive cancer lesions, and the subsequent frequency of developing metastatic lesions as well as responsivity to anticancer treatment, is due to specific virus-host interactions and genomic damages. As paradigm the better prognosis and higher responsivity to treatment of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers in comparison to HPV-negative cancers. Mutations in genes of the apoptotic pathway, particularly the TP53 gene, have been analyzed in cervical cancers. A significant higher mutation frequency of TP53 gene in the CAC adenocarcinoma (32 of 241; 13.3%) compared to SCC squamous cell carcinoma (39 of 657; 5.9%; P=0.0003, (2) test) has been identified. Three codons (175, 248 and 273) were the most commonly mutated in both, codon 249 mainly in SCC, codon 282 only in CAC. The G to A and C to T transitions were the prevalent type of mutations in both SCC and CAC (48.7% and 53.5% of all mutations, respectively). The frequency of C to A transversion was relatively high only in CAC (25%), while the mirror mutation G to T was comparatively frequent in SCC (14.6%).

151 Using genomics to search for new viral causes and treatments for human cancer
Patrick S. Moore, Yuan Chang American Cancer Society Professor, Cancer Virology Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, US
Although animal polyomaviruses, such as SV40, have been critical models in cancer research for over one-half century, polyomaviruses have not-until recently--been linked to human cancer. Using digital transcriptome subtraction, Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) was discovered in 2008 to infect most Merkel cell carcinomas, the most severe form of skin cancer. Normally, MCV is an common and asymptomatic infection of the human skin. In Merkel cell tumors, however, the virus integrates and undergoes mutations that eliminate viral replication but allow continued expression of viral oncogenes. MCV and MCC reveal a new model for carcinogenesis in which a rare combination of xenomutations to healthy skin flora initiate a deadly cancer. Using new sequencing technologies, the causes previouslyunsuspected viral cancers can be uncovered and clues for new rational drug therapies can be designed.

Human herpesvirus 8 is associated with the development of primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), an aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma characterized by the proliferation of the malignant lymphocytes almost exclusively in large serous cavities. The mechanisms involved in the preferential tropism for serous cavities and in the aggressive course of PEL remain to be fully clarified. To study the role of host microenvironment in PEL progression, we previously compared the antineoplastic activity of a murine interferon -expressing lentiviral vector (mIFN-LV) to that of a human IFN- -LV in a murine model of peritoneal PEL. We demonstrated that in vivo targeting of the murine microenvironment showed an antineoplastic activity comparable to that observed with the hIFN- -LV. These findings highlighted the relevant role of body cavity environment in PEL growth and indicated that modulation of microenvironment may impair PEL growth in vivo. By using cocultures of PEL cell lines with human mesothelial cells (HMC), we mimicked the interactions existing in body cavities to analyze the mechanisms involved in PEL progression. PEL cells induced a myofibroblastic morphology in HMC, paralleled by an expression profile indicative of the occurrence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, HMC increased proliferation and resistance to apoptosis of PEL cells. These data indicate that PEL cells induce EMT in HMC and fibrosis of serous membranes. In turn, HMC modulate PEL cell turnover, thus providing a milieu favorable to PEL progression. These findings open new perspectives into the mechanisms involved in PEL progression and may indicate new targets for PEL treatment.

153 Molecular pathogenesis by HTLV-1 bZIP factor
Masao Matsuoka Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, JP
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) mainly transmits by cell-to-cell contact. Therefore, this virus induces proliferation of infected cells to facilitate transmission. In HTLV-1 infected individuals, infected cells proliferate in vivo. This proliferation of infected cells leads to the development of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and inflammatory diseases including HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (HAM). HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) is consistently expressed in ATL cells and HTLV-1 infected cells, and plays a critical role in their proliferation. Transgenic expression of HBZ causes T-cell lymphoma and inflammatory diseases, indicating that HBZ is critical for the pathogenesis of HTLV-1.
We analyzed the function of HBZ and found that it possessed opposite functions to Tax in many pathways. We found that Tax could activate the classical Wnt pathway while HBZ inhibited it by interacting with TCF1/LEF1. The canonical Wnt pathway is activated in the thymus, and its transcription factors, TCF1/ LEF1, suppressed the viral gene transcription by Tax. Conversely, the canonical Wnt pathway is suppressed in the peripheral T cells in which the non-canonical Wnt pathway is activated. HBZ enhanced the expression of Wnt5a, which is a ligand in non-canonical Wnt signaling. Knockdown of Wnt5a suppressed the proliferation and migration of ATL cells. Thus, activation of the non-canonical Wnt pathway by HBZ is linked with proliferation of ATL cells.
These findings suggest that HTLV-1 is adapted to, not thymic T cells, but peripheral T cells. HBZ modulates the intracellular environment suitable for HTLV-1 replication and proliferation of infected cells.

154 Responding to the challenge of AIDS Associated Cancers in Nigeria
Dr. William Blattner and Clement Adebamowo
The stabilization of the HIV epidemic in Africa has uncovered new epidemic of HIV associated comorbidities including cancers which the poorly developed health care system, poor infrastructure and lack of personnel is unable to cope with. In November 2012, international leaders in Cancer Research and Policy from 15 countries met at the NIH, Bethesda and made recommendations about the interventions needed to respond to the global cancer challenge in the world. These include (a) Creation of reliable, population-based registries that define the incidence, mortality, and survival rates of different types of cancers (b) Implementation of prevention measures to mitigate factors now known to promote cancer--tobacco, certain infectious agents, ultraviolet radiation, alcohol, obesity, lack of exercise, and diet, (c) Screening individuals for certain cancers (of the cervix, breast, prostate, and colorectum, in particular) and (d) Optimal cancer treatment. In this presentation, I will highlight how the Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland (IHV) and the Institute of Human Virology Nigeria (IHVN) working with partners in Nigeria and internationally have implemented these recommendations and present data illustrating the outcome of our interventions. For example, Since 2010, 21 cancer registries have been developed or re-strengthened in Nigeria and 3 of these have met the WHO criteria for population based cancer registration (PBCR). These registries are now able to contribute data to the global cancer incidence database after more than 30 years during which there was no data from Nigeria. With mainstreaming of an additional 3 PBCR this year, we would have increased the proportion of Africa covered by PBCR from 11% to 32%. Our results also correct distortions in the estimates of cancer incidence and mortality in Nigeria which was previously based on projections derived from data from cancer registries of other African countries that had been used in the past Cervical cancer is the commonest female cancer in Africa and in women living with HIV/AIDS. Implementation of screening programs has reduced incidence in developed countries by 80% in recent decades but incidence in developing countries remain stable or has been increasing. IHV implements an innovative "screen and treat" with immediate treatment with cold coagulation, digital cervicography for QA/QC and web based consultation for second opinion for early detection of cervical cancer. In collaboration with the Nigerian authorities and other partners, this program plans to reach 1,000,000 Nigerian women with at least 1 lifetime screening event over the next 10 years. This screening project laid the foundation for the NIH funded African Collaborative Center for Microbiome and Genomics Research (ACCME), part of the Wellcome Trust and NIH funded H3Africa initiative, which we set up at the IHVN and is currently engaged in integrative epidemiology of cervical cancer that is exploring the host and viral genomics and epigenomics, somatic cervical cancer genomics as part of NIH led Cancer Genome Atlas mapping project (TCGA), vaginal microenvironment - innate immunity and vaginal microbiota, as well as detailed risk factor characterization of prevalent and persistent HPV infection. Preliminary results from early studies conducted at this Center will be presented. Because of dearth of systematic information about the epidemiology of AIDS Associated Cancers in Africa, we have created a matched prospective cohort of persons living with HIV/AIDS and healthy volunteers who are being followed up every 2 years with detailed clinical evaluation and collection of data and biological samples in order to improve knowledge of the epidemiology of HIV Associated Comorbidities and provide high quality biological samples for molecular and omics studies. In my presentation, I will also mention some of the trainings that we have conducted, research into other cancer risk factors and the work we are doing to map the infrastructural needs for oncology treatment in Nigeria.

155 Evolution by Tumor Neofunctionalization and Phenomenon of Tumor Specifically Expressed, Evolutionarily Novel (TSEEN) genes
Andrei P. Kozlov, PhD The Biomedical Center, St. Petersburg (RU)
Earlier I formulated the hypothesis of the possible evolutionary role of tumors. This hypothesis suggests that tumors supply evolving multicellular organisms with extra cell masses for the expression of newly evolving genes. After expression of novel genes in tumor cells, tumors differentiate in new directions and give rise to new cell types, tissues and organs.
In the presentation, the bulk of data supporting the positive evolutionary role of tumors will be reviewed, obtained both in the lab of the author and from the literature sources.
The following issues will be addressed: the widespread occurrence of tumors in multicellular organisms; features of tumors that could be used in evolution; the relationship of tumors to evo-devo; examples of recapitulation of some tumor features in recently evolved organs; the types of tumors that might play the role in evolution; examples of tumors that have played the role in evolution.
The discussion of experimental confirmation of nontrivial predictions of the hypothesis will include the analysis of evolutionary novelty of tumor-specifically expressed EST sequences; ELFNI - AS1, a human gene with possible microRNA function expressed predominantly in tumors and originated in primates; PBOV1, a human gene of the recent de novo origin with predicted highly tumor-specific expression profile; and the evolutionary novelty of human cancer/testis antigen genes.
The conclusion is made that expression of protogenes, evolutionarily young and/or novel genes in tumors might be a new biological phenomenon, a phenomenon of TSEEN (Tumor Specifically Expressed, Evolutionarily New) genes, predicted by the hypothesis of evolution by tumor neofunctionalization.

Effective use of HAART markedly reduces morbidity and mortality due to classical HIV disease. The 4 key emerging diseases in people with HIV that are amenable to prevention & therapy are Coronary Heart Disease, Renal Disease, Fragility Fractures, Diabetes.
These constitute an increasing burden of morbidity and mortality in HIV uninfected people due to an aging population and are becoming even more prevalent in people with chronic HIV.
The issue is exemplified by fragility fractures, a major cause of mortality in the elderly, and emerging as a manifestation occurring earlier in people with HIV, and increasing in incidence.
The Probono Study from Kings College London demonstrated among 222 patients with matched controls that reported fractures at any site during adulthood occurred more frequently in HIV than controls, 45 (20.3%) vs. 16 (7.2%) (OR=3.27; p=0.0001). Osteoporosis was more prevalent in HIV (17.6% vs. 3.6%, p<0.0001). In HIV, use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), low body mass and serum PTH were significantly related to low BMD in multivariate analysis.
The changing patterns of morbidity and mortality in HIV, driven by the metabolic consequences of HIV infection itself, and the HAART therapy requires development of an appropriate screening and management response.

Pathogenesis of Epstein-Barr Virus-driven
lymphomas of HIV+ patients: new insights
of potential clinical relevance
Riccardo Dolcetti C.R.O. - IRCCS, National Cancer Institute, IT
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)+ patients have an increased risk to develop lymphomas, including a significant fraction of histotypes associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. Although restoration of EBV-specific T-cell function induced by HAART has led to a decreased incidence of the more immunogenic EBV-associated lymphomas, such as immunoblastic and primary central nervous system lymphomas, other EBV+ histotypes are still prevalent in the HAART era, particularly Hodgkin's lymphoma. Therefore, factors other than HIV-induced immune suppression are probably required for the development of EBV-related lymphomas in this setting. Particular attention is being given to the identification of microenvironmental stimuli able to up-regulate critical EBV latency proteins or to induce/enhance EBV replication. In fact, recent evidence indicates that, although latency programs predominate in EBV-driven tumors, lytic EBV replication may also be of pathogenic relevance, at least in the early phases of cell transformation. This is particularly relevant for HIV-related lymphomagenesis since the underlying impairment of immune responses may favour uncontrolled activation of EBV lytic replication in latently-infected B lymphocytes. Available data indicate that local expression of distinct cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-13, may up-regulate the expression of the LMP-1 oncoprotein in B cells, thus favoring lymphomagenesis. In the search of microenvironmental factors that may promote the development of EBV-driven lymphomas in HIV+ patients, we obtained evidence supporting a pathogenic role for HIV matrix protein p17, which accumulates in lymphoid tissues of HIV+ individuals, even during HAART. Our findings support a direct contribution of HIV p17 to the development of EBVdriven lymphomagenesis and may provide the rationale for new strategies of clinical intervention in this setting.

158 Hepatitis C Treatment Update: Current Status and Future Direcctions
Shyam Kottilil National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, US
Hepatitis C virus infection is a major cause of liver disease, with170 million persons infected worldwide. Hepatitis C virus is a ssRNA virus that preferentially infects human hepatocytes. Approximately 80% of HCV infections progress to chronicity, with development of hepatic fibrosis over time with 20% developing cirrhosis within 25 years, and 20% of these developing hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV remains the primary cause of liver transplantation worldwide. Of the 1 million people infected with HIV in the United States, about a third are co-infected with HCV. While cART has dramatically decreased the number of AIDS-related opportunistic infections, HCV- related liver disease has become leading cause of death in this population. HIV/HCV coinfected individuals have an accelerated progression of liver disease and lower therapeutic response rates when compared to their HCV monoinfected counterparts. In light of the higher rates of adverse events observed with current treatment in HIV/HCV coinfected patients, there remains a need for therapies with improved response rates, convenient dosing schedules, and safety profiles. Currently, the field of HCV therapeutics is evolving to rapidly develop strategies that are highly safe and efficacious for the eradication of HCV without the use of interferon formulations. Directly acting antivirals that target various stages of the HCV life cycle are being developed and will likely revolutionize the management of HCV by simplifying treatment, improving tolerability of regimens, and decreasing duration of therapy while maintaining or increasing rates of SVR. This presentation will discuss the newer therapeutics that are being developed for treating hepatitis C in HIV-infected subjects.

160 Treatment Strategies to Minimize the Impact of Antiretroviral Drug Toxicities
Bruce Gilliam Institute of Human Virology, US
Treatment success with antiretroviral drug regimens continues to improve. However, as HIV infected patients live longer, the clinician and patient are challenged with managing the complications of numerous co-morbidities and drug toxicities. While some of these problems may not be able to be prevented, the availability of multiple new antiretroviral agents now gives the clinician and patient multiple options to achieve virologic suppression. This raises the question of which combinations of antiretroviral agents have optimal safety and toxicity profiles for the individual patient. The potential implications of the choice and usage of certain antiretroviral agents and regimens and their known and potential advantages and disadvantages/toxicities will be reviewed and the avenues for further investigation will be highlighted. The complexities of managing an HIV infected patient today, including co-morbidities and antiretroviral drug toxicities, suggest that newer treatment strategies which reevaluate the factors and considerations that influence how antiretroviral agents and regimens are chosen may well move away from the currently recommended regimens in the future to attain the goal of minimization of long-term antiretroviral toxicities.

Background: Tanzania with a population of 44.9 million is classified as one of the 22 high burden countries for tuberculosis (TB). The country houses 5,972 health facilities; the majority in urban areas while rural areas have limited access to TB diagnostic services. The TB notification rate for all cases in 2011 was 153/100,000 people with 59/100,000 being smear positive. Nevertheless, the 2013 National TB prevalence survey revealed prevalence of bacteriological confirmed TB was 354/100,000 with the rural areas more affected. The findings signify more TB than reported. TB continues to major driver of mortality in HIV patients, as reported by facilities supported by IHV, with the highest mortality in our HIV project. 20% died while on TB treatment and 73% died with symptoms of TB. Challenges: IHV's program reports a low rate of TB among HIV patients. By June 2013, 20 districts treated 35,502 HIV patients, with only 1% diagnosed with TB; almost half being from 4 districts with the TB intervention project. The result is likely due to insufficient diagnostic services. In some areas, patients travel 100km to access services. More refined diagnostic techniques to increase sensitivity like LED Microscopy, molecular technology, and sputum culture are insufficient which poses particular challenges for HIV/AIDS patients. TB detection activities have primarily remained health facility based endeavors with minimal community involvement. These circumstances do not provide for an optimal environment for increased TB case detection and hence hinders TB control efforts. Interventions: IHV implements a WHO funded TB program in Tanzania to support active intensified case management which has led to finding more TB cases, with 38% of all forms of TB, and 36% Smear and/or bacteriological positive. Our challenge was the inadequacy of sensitive diagnostic facilities, and hence installed one GeneXpert machine which registered an increase of 6.6% TB cases that were missed by fluorescent microscopy. Building on experience gained and lessons learned, IHV plans to impact case detection through the installation of 4 more GeneXpert machines at high prevalence sites which have limited access to diagnosis. Conclusion and Recommendation: Health systems strengthening for laboratory diagnosis and empowering community case identification can result in a marked increase in TB case finding. With the multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis emerging at an alarming rate, support is required to identify and detect suspected cases, improve diagnostic capacity with efficient technology, and improve linkage between diagnostic centers and treatment facilities.

Enhancement of thermal and mechanical properties of silicone rubber with g-ray irradiationinduced polysilane-modified graphene oxide/ carbon nanotube hybrid fillers

Ke Cao,a Bolong Li, and Pei Dai*a

b Yang Jiao,a Yongjun Lu,a Liancai Wang,a Yueying Guoa

In this study, a polysilane-modified graphene oxide (GO) and carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposite (GO/ CNTs-Si) was prepared as a thermal conductive nanofiller to enhance the thermal and mechanical properties of silicone rubber composites. By g-ray-radiation 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy silane (MPTMS) was polymerized on the surface of GO and CNTs to improve the interfacial interaction between the GO/CNTs-Si and SR matrix. FTIR characterization results demonstrated that polysilane modified the GO/CNTs successfully. The pristine GO/CNTs and resultant GO/CNTs-Si were individually incorporated into a,u-dihydroxypolydimethylsiloxane to vulcanize SR composites. Compared with SR-GO/CNTs, SR- GO/CNT-Si exhibited better mechanical and thermal performance. Moreover, the time-dependent complex modulus of SR-GO/CNTs-Si was much higher than that of SR-GO/CNTs, which indicates longer service time and more stable performance. In terms of electronic packaging, SR-GO/CNTs exhibited better performance than the 1180B counterpart. The low value of warpage of chip packaged by SR-GO/CNTs implied that SR-GO/CNTs-Si could have potential application as the thermal interface electronic packaging material.

Introduction
Silicone rubber (SR), due to its properties such as high thermal stability, elasticity and electric insulation, can be used as the thermal interfacial material of heat transmitting and radiating parts in various elds, such as aviation, electronics and machinery manufacturing.1,2 With the rapid development of miniaturization and integration of electronics, the removal of excess heat and the interfacial stresses have become increasingly critical issues for the enhancement of device service life.3 In order to overcome the disadvantages of thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of pure silicone rubber, llers can be incorporated to the material.4,5 Various types of nano-materials such as silver nanowires,6 ZnO nanograins,7 aluminum nitride nano-sheets,5,8 boron nitride nano-sheets,9,10 carbon nanotubes and graphene nanosheets11,12 have been developed as functional llers to improve the thermal, mechanical, electrical and other properties of SR-based composites.13
Among these llers, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanosheets as the carbon nanomaterials possess remarkable

physical and chemical properties arising from its extraordinary mechanical strength, large specic surface area, high intrinsic mobility and excellent thermal and electrical conductivities.14-16 Moreover, it has been shown that a combination of graphene and CNTs can endow outstanding performances for improving the properties of nanocomposites. Jyoti17 prepared a graphene oxide/ CNT hybrid material, which reinforced acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). The static and dynamic mechanical properties of graphene oxide/CNT ABS hybrid composites were signicantly improved. Not only the mechanical properties but the tribological properties were remarkable due to the incorporation of hybrids of graphene oxide and CNTs.18 Furthermore, the hybrid carbon nanomaterials can be also employed as advanced functional materials. Chen19 synthesized polydopamine-functionalized graphene/CNTs as the adsorbent to measure the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. However, CNTs and graphene are both difficult to disperse in the polymer matrix during processing, and they are not suitable for industrial-scale production because of the over complicated technology and expensive cost.20
Modifying carbon nanomaterials by g-ray exhibits great advantages, such as easy control, cost-effectiveness and environmentally friendly, which show the potential to be scaled up.21-23 Recently, hybrid carbon nano-ller systems have been investigated as a new approach to enhance the performance of composites.24,25 Moreover, the incorporation of graphene/CNT

hybrid llers prepared by g-ray radiation into a rubber matrix results in favorable dispersion and signicant improvement in the properties.26-28 The mechanical properties and thermal stability of poly(vinyl alcohol) composite lms were enhanced since the interconnected 3D structure of graphene/CNTs formed that inhibited the aggregation.29 The irradiation technique has opened a sane path for the preparation of graphene/ CNTs hybrid llers with good dispersibility.
In this study, functionalized graphene oxide/carbon nanotube hybrid llers (GO/CNT-Si) were synthesized in a facile way. The oxygen functional groups of GO and CNT were induced to produce oxygen radical, which initiated 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy silane polymerized on the surface of GO and CNT. SR and GO/ CNT-Si were mixed by mechanical stirring and molded by casting. The GO/CNT-Si hybrid carbon nanomaterial could signicantly improve the thermal transfer ability and mechanical properties of SR owing to the interconnected structure.
Experiment
Materials
Graphene oxide was obtained from The Sixth Element (Changzhou) Materials Technology Co., Ltd, China. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (purity > 95 wt%) with an average length of 1-2 mm were purchased from Chengdu Organic Chemistry Co., Ltd, China. 3-Methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy silane was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd, China. a,u-Dihydroxy polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with viscosity of 50 Pa s was purchased from Hoshine Silicon Industry Co., Ltd, Luzhou, China, and was used as received. Tetraethyl orthosilicate used as the cross-linking agent and dibutyltin dilaurate used as the catalyst were purchased by Fuchen Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, Tianjin, China. The underll 1180B as the reference warpage sample is one kind of commercial primer applied between chip and substrate. It was purchased from Themis Industrial Adhesives. All the other chemical reagents (analytical grade) were obtained from Beijing Chemical Works (China) and used as received without further purication.

and the average values of the gel content test results are presented for comparison and analysis.
The tensile properties of the SR composite were measured by a SANS CMT-4203 universal mechanical tester with a load cell of 100 N and a gauge length of 20 mm at across the head speed of 10 mm minÀ1.
Thermal expansion performance was tested on a thermomechanical analyzer (Shimadzu TMA-50, Shimadzu, Japan). The sample (5 mm Â 5 mm) were heated in the temperature range from 60 C to 200 C at a heating rate of 5 C minÀ1 under N2. The thermal expansion ratio (TER) can be calculated from the increased thickness of the SR composite sample according to eqn (2)

TER ¼ h2 Â 100%

(2)

h1

where h2 is the thickness of the sample at different temperatures and h1 is the original thickness of the sample.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Shimadzu TGA-50 thermal analyzer. The samples were heated from room temperature to 800 C at a heating rate of 10 C minÀ1 under N2. Thermal conductivity of the samples was obtained on a DZDRS thermal conductivity tester (Nanjing Dazhan Institute of Electromechanical Technology) by the standard method (isotropic), which was based upon a transient plane source technology. Viscoelastic properties of the cured SR composites were measured via time-temperature superposition experiments using a GABO Eplexor 500 N dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer under tensile mode operation. The temperature frequency sweep method was employed since viscoelastic properties are both time- and temperature-dependent. The temperature was increased from À140 C to À30 C with the frequency scanned at 1, 3, 10, and 50 Hz at each isothermal temperature. The uncured packaging underll lled the IC chip (14 mm Â 14 mm) from side to side at room temperature. The chip warpage measurement was carried out on a Quantigraf-600 system (C&B Tech., USA) with temperature increasing from 25 C to 150 C then decreasing to 25 C.

Characterization and measurement

The morphology of GO/CNT-Si was characterized via high-

resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Tecnai

F30, Philips-FEI Co., Holland). The vulcanized SR composite

samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen, then the fractured

surface was sputtered with gold, and the fractured morphol-

ogies of the samples were observed by scanning electron

microscopy (SEM; model JCM-5000, Jeol Co., Japan).

The cross-linking degree was determined by the gel content

percentage of the sample, which was extracted in THF at the

boil for 72 h. The cross-linking degree (CD) can be calculated

from weight of gel of composite sample according to eqn (1)

CD ¼ m2 Â 100%

(1)

m1

where m2 indicates the weight of the gel of sample and h1 indicates the original weight of the sample before solvent (THF) extraction. Five samples were tested for each SR-GO/CNT-Si-XX,

Synthesis of polysilane-functionalized GO/CNT nanocomposites
GO/CNT nanocomposites were synthesized by g-ray radiation in a typical procedure: 500 mg GO and 500 mg CNT were dispersed into a glass ask with 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) by ultrasonication on a scientz-II Dultrasonicator (Ningbo, China) at room temperature for 1 h to obtain a uniform suspension. The 50 mL 3methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy silane was dropped in the THF suspension of GO/CNTs with evenly stirring. The THF/3methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy suspension of GO/CNTs was transferred into a glass tube. Then, the mixture was directly exposed to g-ray from a 60Co source in air. The absorbed dose was 50 kGy at a dose rate of about 50 Gy minÀ1. The suspension was ltratedwashed with THF for ve times to remove homopolymeried polysilane and unreacted silane, and then dried for 12 h in a vacuum oven at 60 C. The production was named GO/CNT-Si.

THF (20 mL) by an ultrasonicator for 30 min to obtain uniform dispersion. The GO/CNT-Si THF suspension was dropped in the PDMS mixture under stirring. Finally, the mixed solution was poured into a Teon mold for sample formation (150 mm Â 150 mm Â 2 mm). The formation mold containing sample was placed in an oven, and the sample was cured at 25 C. A series of SR composite samples with different GO/CNT-Si loadings were prepared in the same way and named SR-GO/CNT-Si-XX, where XX represent the weight percentage of GO/CNT-Si to PDMS.

Result and discussion
Fig. 1 shows the FTIR spectra of GO/CNTs and GO/CNT-Si. The broad absorption of $3200 cmÀ1 can be assigned to the O-H vibration.30 The strong peak at 1639 cmÀ1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of C]C.31 Aer radiation of GO/CNTs in the MPTMS/THF solution, the strong absorption band at 1016 cmÀ1 attributed to the stretching vibration of Si-O appeared, which obscured the C-O stretching vibrational absorption. The signal at 1378 cmÀ1 was assigned to the -CH3 stretching vibration of polysilane. Together, these results conrmed that MPTMS was successfully gra-polymerized on the surface of graphene/CNT nanocomposites.
The TEM micrographs of the pristine CNTs, GO and modied GO/CNT-Si are shown in Fig. 2. The frizzy CNT aggregation

dispersed on the micro grid support membrane. The micrographs of GO/CNT-Si exhibited that the CNTs dispersed individually on the surface and edges of graphene nanosheets. CNTs are uniformly distributed between the layers of graphene nanosheets, which indicated the formation of the interconnected 3D network structure.32 The structure could effectively avoid the aggregation of nanotubes and nanosheets. Furthermore, it might make GO/CNT-Si suitable for preparing SR nanocomposites with good thermal conductivity.
The distribution of GO/CNT-Si in the SR matrix was investigated by observing the morphology of the fractured surface of each composite sample. SEM micrographs of SR-GO/CNT-Si0.1, SR-GO/CNT-Si-0.5, SR-GO/CNT-Si-1.0, SR-GO/CNT-Si-1.5, SR-GO/CNT-Si-2.0 and SR-GO/CNT-Si-3.0 composites are shown in Fig. 3(a)-(f). SEM images clearly show that GO/CNT-Si was dispersed homogeneously in the SR matrix. As the weight percentage of GO/CNT-Si increases, more and more nanoller particles appeared on the fracture surface. The homogeneous dispersion of GO/CNT-Si throughout the SR matrix would help improve the mechanical properties and thermal transfer ability.
The relative amount of CD can provide useful information on cross-linking efficiencies. Fig. 4(a) shows the CD of SR-GO/CNTSi-XX determined experimentally as a function of the GO/CNT-Si

content. As expected, the CD was increased from 88.5% to 94.4% with the increase in the GO/CNT-Si weight percentage from 0.1 wt% to 3.0 wt%. Compared with SR, SR-GO/CNT-Si was higher due to cross-linking between the llers and the matrix. Meanwhile, CD was one of the important factors which improved mechanical performances of SR-GO/CNT-Si signicantly. Increasing the addition amount of GO/CNT-Si could lead to a considerable increase in the tensile strength of SR. Besides the development of CD, GO and CNT are both rigid reinforcement nanollers, which formed interactions with the SR matrix. Moreover, the good dispersal ability of GO/CNT-Si in SR contributed to the improvement of the mechanical properties. It can be concluded that the incorporation of GO/CNT-Si could simultaneously enhance the strength and toughness of SR-GO/ CNT-Si composites. However, the negative effect for elongation at break of SR-GO/CNT-Si did not appear until the GO/CNT-Si content reached 3.0 wt%. This is mainly because the interaction between polysilane-modied GO/CNT-Si and SR matrix could reduce crack or defect under stress.
The operation of miniaturized and integrated electric devices would produce heat rapidly and intensively.33 The thermal properties of SR packaging composites indicate that thermal expansion and thermal stability directly affect the

service life of electronic equipment. The polymer chain thermal motion depends on temperature, so that the thermal expansion ratio has the positive correlation with temperature.34 As shown in Fig. 5(a), the thermal expansion ratio of SR-GO/CNT-Si nanocomposites increased with the increase in temperature. On other hand, it decreased with the increase in the GO/CNT-Si content. The TER of SR-GO/CNT-Si-0.1 rose to 4.85% from 60 C to 200 C. SR-GO/CNT-Si-3.0 with more GO/CNT-Si weight percentage exhibited lower thermal expansion ability. TER of SR-GO/CNT-Si-3.0 was 4.37%, which was lower than that of SR- GO/CNT-Si-0.1. The thermal expansion ratio of GO and CNTs is much lower than that of SR. The strong interaction of GO/CNTSi and the SR matrix limited and restricted the thermal expansion motion of SR chains. At a high temperature, the low thermal expansion ratio of the composites could reduce the thermal stress, which led to the interfacial seal failure between the electronic device and SR.
As the temperature continued to rise, the covalent bond of the SR chain was vibrated more intensely and even broken. TGA was employed to investigate the thermal stability of SR/GO- CNT-Si composites. The pristine SR degradation curve included

three weight loss stages. The temperature zone of the rst thermal degradation stage is from 158 C to 360 C. The weight
loss is attributed to the decomposition of the catalyst. The second weight loss stage with an initial temperature 360 C and nal temperature 462 C was assigned to the unreacted -OH of SR chain.35 The last stage (462-607 C) was attributed to the degradation of main chain of SR.36 As shown in Fig. 5(b), the initial temperature of SR/GO-CNT-Si was increased except for
the catalyst weight loss stage with the incorporation of more GO-CNT-Si. Moreover, the char yield of SR/GO-CNT-Si also increases with the increase in the GO-CNT-Si content. The results evidenced that the hybrid carbon nanoller could
improve the heat resistance of SR composites. The temperature of the maximum mass loss rate of SR/GO-CNT-Si-3.0 was nearly 50 C higher than that of SR. The combined survey results from
the thermal expansion and thermal stability tests concluded that GO-CNT-Si could improve the thermal properties of SR for
the application in electronic packaging.
Thermal conductivity is the key factor for electronic pack-
aging thermal interface materials. The SR composites should
form an interconnected thermal conductive network to transfer
heat rapidly. The polysilane on the GO/CNT-Si surface improved
the dispersibility and compatibility with the SR matrix, which
reduced the thermal resistance between GO/CNT-Si and SR, so
that the thermal conductivity of SR composites increased with
the increase in the GO/CNT-Si content (Fig. 6). The maximum value of GO composites is 0.51 W mÀ1 KÀ1 (SR-GO/CNT-Si-3.0),
which is nearly 4-fold higher than that of neat SR. On the one hand, the modied GO/CNT dispersed uniformly in SR. On the
other hand, GO as a 2-D carbon nanomaterial and CNT as a 1-D
carbon nanomaterial could connect with each other to form a 3-
D thermal transfer network. It has been reported that the thermal conductivity of the SR composite is 0.26 W mÀ1 KÀ1 with 8 wt% graphene nanoplatelet addition.37 In our study, the thermal conductivity of the SR composite reached 0.31 W mÀ1 KÀ1 with only a tiny amount of GO/CNT-Si (0.1 wt%).
Stress relaxation of the electronic packaging material can greatly affect its application performance. SR is one of the
viscoelastic polymer packaging materials and its viscoelastic properties were estimated via the time-temperature superposition (TTS) principle.38,39 The right part of Fig. 7(a) with the

frequency range from 1 to 50 Hz is the TTS plot of SR. These showed the frequency dependence of the complex modulus of SR at different isothermal temperatures from À120 C to À102 C. Based on this gure, a modulus curve of a certain temperature (e.g., À110 C) was selected as the reference. Then, this modulus curve can be extended to a lower frequency range by shiing the higher temperature modulus curves to the le along the frequency axis, and vice versa. Thus, a master curve can be constructed for that reference temperature over an extended frequency range.
As shown in Fig. 7(a), the master curves of stress relaxation of pure SR were constructed by shiing the isothermal curves horizontally. Aer curve tting, the master curves of the timedependent stress relaxation modulus of SR composites are displayed in Fig. 7(b). The incorporation of GO-CNT-Si carbon nanocomposites improved the resistance ability to stress relaxation. Moreover, the modulus increased with the increase in the content of GO-CNT-Si in the SR composite. As the Fig. 7(b) shown, the modulus of pure SR was dropped to nearly zero obviously aer 1 Â 1015 s, whereas the modulus of SR/GO-CNTSi-3.0 composites remained to 300 MPa. It proved that SR/GO- CNT-Si composites keep well useable performance.
In terms of electronic packaging, SR-GO/CNT-Si-3.0, SR and 1180B were applied as underll between gaps of three ip-chip samples, respectively. Warpage of chips during the temperature cycling (25 C-150 C-25 C) was measured. Warpage is the difference between the maximum and the minimum distances of the median surface of chips from the reference plane, where the reference plane is determined through the least-square method. It was obvious that the warpage of the chip used SR as an underll is the largest, which was 0.043 mm at 75 C and had a variation of 0.028 mm during the temperature cycling. Among three samples, the warpage of the chip where SR-GO/ CNT-Si-3.0 was applied as an underll is the smallest and its variation (0.014 mm) during the temperature cycling is also smaller than 1180B (0.020 mm). It was concluded that using SRGO/CNT-Si-3.0 as an underll can improve the thermomechanical reliability of ip-chips (Fig. 8).

Conclusion
In this study, the modied GO/CNT was designed and prepared by MPTMS graing polymerization induced by g-ray irradiation. The produced GO/CNT-Si exhibited better dispersion and interfacial interaction with the SR matrix. As expected, the mechanical properties of SR-GO/CNT-Si increased with the increase in the carbon nanocomposite content. The thermal properties including thermal expansion ratio, thermal stability and conductivity were improved signicantly, which is an important criterion for the signicant enhancement in thermal interface electronic packaging performances of the composites. The incorporation of GO/CNT-Si could prolong the service life of SR composite due to the resistance ability to stress relaxation. It is concluded that using SR-GO/CNT-Si as underll can improve the thermo-mechanical reliability of ip-chips.

Insights into ZnO-based doped porous nanocrystal frameworks
Buzuayehu Abebe * and H. C. Ananda Murthy *
Colloidal nanocrystals play a vital role in several applications. The doping of cations in the nanocrystal matrix enhances the optical, electrical, and magnetic properties. The number and well-defined distribution of the dopant are crucial to protect the nanocrystal from clustering. The XRD, XPS, and XAS instruments reveal the change in the lattice parameters, chemical states, and local coordination environment information. In addition of detecting the position and distribution of the dopant, the 4D-STEM detector mode gathers all types of real-space atomic-resolution images by collecting all diffraction datasets from each electron probe with high-speed and efficient detection. Dopant-host ligand type, reactions conditions, and reaction time optimization during synthesis are critical for the host and dopant reactivity balance. Pearson's hard/soft acids/bases theory would be a base for balancing the solubility of the dopant-host in the given solvents/ surfactant. In addition, tuning the colloidal nanocrystals to secondary structures, which enhances the mass-/ ions transport, can contribute a combination of properties that do not exist in the original constituents.

1. Introduction
Nanotechnology is a progressive area of science used for manufacturing nanoscale materials.1 Among different nanomaterials, semiconductor metal oxides are highly stable, nontoxic, inexpensive, and have superior catalytic properties. ZnO, a wide bandgap semiconductor (3.37 eV), has all the abovementioned properties; however, it cannot degrade pollutants under visible light.2 The photocatalytic properties of the materials could be further enhanced by doping noble metals as an electron reservoir.3 Industrially, the incorporation of impurities in the host matrix for improved device functionality is expensive.4,5
The unique properties of nanoscale materials (NMs) such as electronic density, charge distribution, and lattice distortion have great impacts on their applications.6 The effective doping of metal or metal ions, which creates either an n-type or p-type dopant, is one of the main ways to tune the optical, magnetic, and optical properties. Besides, the incorporation of impurities also increases the surface-to-volume ratios, creates crystal defects, and traps charge carriers.7-9 However, the dopant should substitute the host atoms effectively so that decent dopant-host balance reactivity occurs. The selection of suitable host-dopant type, synthetic approach, solvent, and surfactant are crucial parameters for balancing the reactivity. For the successful incorporation of the dopant in the host lattice, the host-dopant type is essential. According to Pearson's hard/so acids/bases (HSAB) theory, for the successful diffusion of the dopant ions into the host lattice, the hardness of the dopant should be less than that of the host in a hard base solvent such as water.10,11
The doping process may be under the control of either kinetic or thermodynamic equilibrium.12-14 Compared to the former, the latter synthetic equilibrium process creates stable and efficiently doped nanocomposites.15 Several synthetic approaches such as single-source precursors, nucleationdoping, growth-doping, and cation diffusion follow either the thermodynamic or kinetic equilibrium process. Nowadays, the cation diffusion technique is a progressive approach.16
The properties of the doped materials can be understood using advanced analytical techniques. The XRD pattern conrms the formation of a local heterojunction and interstitial or/and substitutional incorporation depending on the angle shi. The optical properties of the doped materials were understood from the DRS/UV-vis and PL techniques. So Lewis acid dopants (such as Ag and Cu) improve the light absorption efficiency and also condense the bandgap by creating an interband between the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) of the host.17 Intensity reduction in the PL spectra is an indication of the electron-hole recombination diminishing properties of the materials,18 which enhances its application, especially in photocatalysis. XPS and XAS techniques give the composition, chemical state, local coordination environment, and oxidation states of the doped material.19,20 In addition, a radical instruments such as ADF-STEM and EELS-STEM detect

the atomic level incorporated dopants based on the contrasts.21,22
In addition, tuning the material to have a secondary structure during synthesis (ordered porous crystalline frameworks) boosts the mass-/ion-transports of the materials toward precise applications such as energy devices.10,23 For the development of decent ordered porous crystalline frameworks, selecting a suitable solvent, reaction temperature, nanocrystal tethering, and pore generating architecture-directing agent (ADA) is vital. Herein, this review also provides awareness about the dopant- host reactivity balance, characterization techniques for the doped materials, and porous crystalline frameworks. The paper also gives detailed insight into Cu- and Ag-doped and co-doped ZnO-based materials using crucial analytical techniques. Besides, the photocatalytic and antibacterial activities of the doped materials, and the mechanisms involved in these activities have also been discussed.
2. Dopant-host reactivity balances
The host-dopant reactivity balance is highly dependent on sufficient time for effective dopant trapping, surface morphology, shape, dopant host ligand type, and reaction conditions.16 The HSAB theory helps in tuning the solubility balance by the careful selection of metal ions to the ligands/ solvents affinity.24 According to the HSAB theory, hard acids favor hard bases, while so acids favor so bases to bind and yield ionic and covalent complexes, respectively. The HSAB absolute hardness (h) of some cations and ligands are given in Table 1. Besides, Fig. 1 also groups the so, borderline, and hard acids/bases and molecular recognition based on the HSAB theory. Hard/borderline Lewis acids such as Zn(II) ion are easily exchanged with so acids such as Cu(I) and Ag(I) ion when hard base solvents (alcohols and water) are used. On the other hand,

Review

so acids cations are spontaneously exchanged with harder acid cations if so bases are used.10,11,25 In the presence of a hard base (water as a solvent) and poly(vinyl alcohol) surfactant, the non-inclusion of the manganese hard Lewis acid in the ZnO lattice was veried in our recent study.26 In its place, the local heterojunction was formed between manganese oxide and zinc oxide aer the oxidation of the adsorbed manganese ion on the surface of zinc oxide at 500 C.
As reported by Buonsanti and Milliron,16 the common approaches used for balancing the reactivity of the dopant and host precursors are: (i) single-source precursors, (ii) nucleationdoping, (ii) the growth-doping, (iii) tuning of ligand-metal bond strength, and (vi) cation diffusion (Scheme 1). A single-source precursor is effective in controlling the nal stoichiometry of the constituents and easily forms a direct chemical bond between the host matrix and the dopant. Still, stronger attraction among the elements composing the cluster is a requirement compared to the ligands and the cluster. If the attraction among the elements is not strong enough and, if the other attraction dominates, a complex decomposition takes place and diminishes the dopant concentration. Using chimie douce single-source molecular precursors approach, mixing of similar zinc- and copper-ketoacidooximates precursors, Pashchanka et al. synthesized a `green body' nanorod arrays morphology of Cu(II)-doped ZnO.27 In this study, chemical processing techniques (dichloromethane (CH2Cl2)) were used to remove the polycarbonate lm template-forming agent.
During the nucleation-doping method, in which the dopant and the host precursors are mixed once, their reactivity is regulated so that the dopant nucleates rst, followed by its overcoating by the host shell. On the other hand, in the growthdoping method, the dopant precursors are added to the growing

host shell by controlling the reaction conditions/temperature to reach the required size so that the dopant is encapsulated by the overgrowing host matrix shell and connes the dopant in the core. In general, the growth process of the host materials is controlled by decreasing the temperature of the reaction. In addition, using a reactive host precursor, and decreasing the overcoating temperature were reported in several studies,15,28,29 which also prevents the diffusion of the dopant from the core at high temperatures.
From the concept of HSAB theory, appropriate ligand-metal bond strength classication is also used to balance the host and dopant reactivity. For successful dopant incorporation into the zinc oxide semiconductor, so Lewis acid dopant cation (low positive charge and large size) such as Cu and Ag are chosen. The soness and hardness of the coordinating ligands and the size of the cations also affect the dopant-host reactivity. If the dopant cation is a harder Lewis acid compared to the host cation, more reactive dopant coordinating ligands are required for successful incorporation.30 In addition, if a comparable size of the host and dopant cations is used, the reactivity becomes less for dopant integration.31 Besides, similar coordinating ligands can also be used if the host and dopant cations have similar reactivity.32,33 Similarities in reactivity and ionic radii were also reported34 for improved dopant concentration insertion.
The nal approach described by Buonsanti and Milliron16 that was used for the incorporation of both cationic and anionic dopants was ion diffusion. This approach allows ions of the dopant to be exchanged within a few seconds in the pre-shaped host matrix. The ion diffusion approach exchanges the cation

with remarkable speeds under kinetic control at low temperatures. The host-dopant cations were exchanged without affecting the crystal framework.35 The (a) association and dissociation process of the crystals, which is dened in terms of lattice energy (lattice enthalpy) and surface energy, and (b) the solvation and desolvation process of the ions leads to a successful cation-exchange procedure.35 The association and dissociation process of the crystal measures the strength of the chemical bonding, while the solvation and desolvation process of the ions depends on the number of ions solvated from the host precursor and ions desolvated from the dopant precursor. If the number of ions solvated is greater than the ions desolvated, the reaction is favored by increasing the overall entropy of the system and such a reaction does not take place unless a careful choice of the solvents and so Lewis bases/ligands is used.10,36,37
In addition to the thermodynamic factors, the cationexchange tactic is also dependent on the kinetic factor of the reaction process such as ions diffusivity or/and activation energy barriers.38 Actually, the cation-exchange process is also reported to occur during the growth of the host matrix.4 The diffusion of the dopant into the host cell is also dependent on the dopant concentrations, the type of the coordinating ligands used, and temperature.15,35 The process of dopant adsorption, diffusion, and ejection in the host lattice is similarly dependent on the optimization of the critical temperature of the overall synthetic process.15
2.1. Silver-doped ZnO nanocrystals
Silver ion has a larger ionic size (0.126 nm) compared to zinc ion (0.074 nm); thus, the doping of silver into the ZnO lattice creates a doped band, which shis the Fermi level toward the VB (deep acceptor level) and induces a p-type property.39,40 Besides, the interstitial and substitutional incorporation of Ag into the ZnO lattice causes quantiable higher and lower angle shis, respectively.41-46 However, the segregation or formation of a local heterojunction47 between Ag and ZnO does not result in any peak shi in XRD.48,49 In fact, the formation of a local heterojunction, and interstitial and substitutional defects were dependent on the synthetic approach, cation hardness, and surfactant or/and solvent type. To indicate this, Yildirim et al.42 showed an XRD pattern lower degree shi due to the substitution of Ag+ into the ZnO lattice and a higher degree shi was shown by Modwi et al.46 due to the interstitial sites' doping. The formation of deep-level acceptor and stability improvement were proved by density functional theory calculations within the generalized gradient approximation analysis.50
The detailed procedure for the synthesis of tri-ethanolamine (C6H15NO3) surfactant-assisted Ag-doped ZnO nanocomposites (sol-gel-based synthetic approach) was proposed in the study by Sagadevan et al.51 The composite was synthesized by the dropwise addition of AgNO3 in an aqueous solution of Zn(CH3COO)2$2H2O, possibly following the growth-doping type dopant-host reactivity balance approach. The addition of excess NH4OH solution results in the precipitation of the acetate ion to ammonium acetate (NH4CH3COO) and the development of

metal hydroxide colloidal particles (Zn(OH)2 and AgOH). Ammonium acetate was removed by washing with deionized water, and then it was washed with acetone to remove water. Lastly, the nal product was calcined at 300 C to oxidize the metal hydroxides (removal of water of crystallization) to stable metal oxide or/and doped metal oxide nanocomposites.
Using the hydrothermal approach, Jin et al.43 proposed the substitution of Ag in the ZnO lattice. The experiment was conducted by the dropwise addition of ammonia in the mixture of zinc and silver solution. With the continuous addition of ammonia, rst, a milky colored zinc hydroxide (Zn(OH)2), then the Zn complex (Zn(OH)42À, and nally, a clear solution was formed when the molar ratio of zinc ion and ammonia base reached 1 : 4. In this process, the nal solutions, which contain ZnAg(OH)2 and ZnAg(OH)42À , were allowed to oxidize in an autoclave to form Ag-doped ZnO (ZnAgO). A related solvothermal synthetic approach was also reported in Zheng et al.'s study by the dropwise addition of NaOH in silver and zinc solution mixture.52
Using digital mechanoelectrospinning direct-writing for polyethylene oxide template deposition, a hydrothermal method for ZnO nanoarray growth and photoreduction for doping silver approaches were reported; aligned hierarchical Ag-deposited ZnO nanoheterostructure arrays with high nitrogen dioxide gas sensing performance were synthesized by Yin et al.53 The formation of more than zero-dimensional nanomaterials was stated to enhance the surface area and gas sensing properties of the materials; a related surface area improvement interpretation was also given in Singhet al.'s work.39 From the results,53 a hexagonal wurtzite ZnO and facecentered cubic Ag structure with d spacing values of 0.26 nm and 0.23 nm, respectively, were obtained using the HRTEM image analysis, with no ZnO lattice distortion. Besides, the deposition of Ag NPs on the surface of the ZnO nanorods was further conrmed from a highly sensitive HAADF-STEM image.
The non-incorporation of Ag in the ZnO lattice was also conrmed by Ansari et al.48 (Fig. 2(A)) and Alharthi et al.49 In Ansari et al.'s work, the Ag-anchored ZnO material was synthesized by a biogenic approach using an electrochemically active biolm.48 The deposition of Ag on the surface of ZnO was also indirectly understood from DRS analysis (Fig. 2(C)), which shows Ag localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band characteristics in the wavelength range of 400-550 nm. The LSPR features of the materials occurred when frequency matching between the conduction bands conned the electron oscillation and the incident light exits.54 This LSPR effect is also reported in other works55-57 and is attributed to the intense light absorption and scattering reection behavior of the doped Ag clusters. Besides, with an increase in the amount of AgNO3, higher energy plasmon peak shi and intensity heightening were noticed due to the presence of silver on the surface and increase in the cluster size, respectively.56
Besides, Ziashahabi et al.57 reported the lower wavelength plasmonic peak shi on aged Ag/ZnO samples due to silver oxidation, which was not observed on the freshly synthesized Ag/ZnO sample. The HR-TEM images (Fig. 2(B)) and XPS analysis also conrmed the presence of strong interaction between

Comparable XPS binding energy shi and splitting values were also reported in the literature.42,43,49,56,58-60 The lower energy shi is ascribed to the binding energy difference between Ag(0) and Ag(I), in which Ag(I) has much greater binding energy than Ag(I).
Besides, in Ansari et al.'s work, the formation of local contact/composite between Ag and ZnO, which enhances electron transfer without recombination, was also further conrmed via PL analysis (Fig. 2(D)); the smaller the peak intensity, the lower the electron-hole recombination activity.18 Similar explanations were also given in other studies and reported to be due to the occurrence of metal-semiconductor Schottky contact.3,40,49 This electron transfer without recombination was described by the band energy difference between Ag (more positive band energy) and ZnO (Fig. 3), which leads to continuous electron transfer from ZnO to Ag until their Fermi level values become equivalent.3,42 The electron-hole separation is dependent on the Ag disparity, the concentration of the Ag- ZnO interface, and vacancy defects.52 As seen in Fig. 3, during the irradiation of the doped photocatalyst in the presence of vacancies, the electron transfer follows either path I (toward doped Ag) or path II (toward the created ZnO vacancy). The method used to synthesize Ag-doped ZnO material, reagents, substrate or/and surfactants used, and the morphology of the synthesized material is also given in Table 2.

2.2. Copper-doped ZnO nanocrystals
Zinc and copper have similar electronic congurations and comparable atomic radii but different structures, which limits the stability of the doped copper toward dissolution. Doping of copper into the ZnO host improves the optical, electrical, and magnetic properties, which is not observed in isolated constituents. A higher bandgap semiconductor metal oxide such as zinc oxide, ZnO, has outstanding thermal, optical, and electrical properties. ZnO also has higher light spectrum absorption efficiency and lower production cost.61 However, the number and exact position of the dopant should be achieved to prevent the clustering of dopant atoms that have a damaging effect.62 The oxidation states of copper (Cu, Cu(I), or Cu(II)) in the ZnO matrix is contentious and seems to be dependent on various parameters such as dopant concentration, temperature, and type of synthetic approach.19,27 The general host-dopant molecular precursor's decomposition and reaction process for nitrate precursor (as an example) are given in eqn (1) for ZnO and eqn (2) for copper-doped ZnO, where x is the doping amount and d is the spillover valence of oxygen.63

The solution combustion process enables the nal products of the nanomaterials with precise stoichiometric ratio, pronounced disparity, and uniform composition.64 Fig. 4 shows the solution combustion synthetic process accompanied by the heating of the fuel and oxidant to its ignition temperature. When a mixture of the metal nitrate precursors (which acts as oxidizer) and the urea fuel (as reducer) is heated to its ignition temperature, the metal ion-fuel complex starts to undergo combustion and form oxides. The combustion process is a selfpropagation process, which could be controlled only by adjusting the ratio of reducing and oxidizing valances. Further

Gupta et al. synthesized highly porous doped materials using a simple combustion approach in the presence of glycine as a fuel.63 The combustion method is one of the methods that create pores/voids within the nanoparticles by releasing gas due to the exothermic reactions.65 The fuel/reducer has a prominent role in facilitating the combustion process by creating an exothermic reaction and change in the morphology of the NPs. However, the porous materials synthesized by this approach exist in a disordered form rather than an ordered form, which can be synthesized by choosing appropriate nanocrystal tethering and pore-generating domain surfactants.
Nowadays, several approaches such as sol-gel, Pechini, coprecipitation, solid-state reaction, hydrothermal, solvothermal, successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction,

chemical bath deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, spray pyrolysis, pulsed laser deposition, ballmilling, and sonochemical method are being employed for synthesizing transition metal-doped ZnO materials.66 In the sol-gel and Pechini approaches, the pH of the solution, aging, and annealing temperature are the major parameters affecting the particle size, the nucleation and growth units, and the morphology of the NMs.67 The coprecipitation technique is applied by the dropwise addition of the precipitating agent in the precursor solution, and calcinating the product at high temperature. The coprecipitation method is suitable for the atomic-level mixing of the host and dopant at low temperature; however, it is difficult to control the nanocrystals' (NCs) geometry.66 Both the solid-state reaction and coprecipitation technique present a decent stoichiometry of the product, in which the former needs higher temperature than the latter. The solid-

state reaction follows the homogeneous mixing of oxides and calcination at high temperatures. The synthesis of NMs by the hydrothermal and solvothermal techniques employs an autoclave with stepwise heating and cooling in the temperature range between 100 and 300 C and then storing for several days. The solvothermal method uses a different solvent than that in the hydrothermal method, which uses only water as a solvent. The spray pyrolysis and pulsed laser deposition methods are used to deposit thin lms. Ball-milling is a simple process but needs high annealing temperature and consumes more time.68
Various concentrations of Cu(II) ion-doped ZnO lms were synthesized by sputter chamber deposition techniques with the help of sapphire as the substrate.19 From the XRD pattern, a contraction of the lattice due to the smaller size of Cu(I) and Cu(II) compared to the Zn(II) ion was noticed. Increasing the dopant concentration showed decreasing intensity and increasing FWHM values, which corroborates the reduction of both the crystallite size and crystallinity of the composite. Similarly, the observed shi in the peak position toward a higher 2q value, decreasing peak intensity, and peak broadening were also reported in various works69-73 and explained to be due to the contraction of the c lattice due to the doping of Cu atoms into the ZnO lattice. No impurity peak conforming to copper was found, which indicates the absence of structural distortion in the ZnO lattice, although the XRD technique is not sensitive to small doped particles.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can directly observe the doped nanocrystal; however, it cannot give the correct oxidation state. Based on the HTEM image analysis, Pashchanka et al. interpreted the effective doping of copper ions into the ZnO lattice.27 The experimentally obtained lattice fringe for Cu-doped ZnO (0.254 nm) is smaller compared to the normal ZnO interplanar spacing,74 which conrms the substitution of copper ion (which has an ionic radius of 0.057 nm) with zinc ions (which has an ionic radius of 0.060 nm).
An element-specic sensitive technique such as XAS (containing XANES and EXAFS) reveals the detailed information about the dopant oxidation state. Liu et al. reported that the XAS technique can be effectively used to study the local order, electronic environment, position, and distribution of doped copper.19 As indicated, the edge change is due to the incorporation of Cu at the Zn site, which causes minor disorder but does not affect the ZnO structure. From the backgroundsubtracted and normalized Cu K edge XANES spectra, the detected pre-edge peaks, ca. 8977.5 eV and 8981 eV show the presence of Cu(II) and trace amount of Cu(I) oxidation state, respectively. Related XAS interpretation was also given on the bullet-like morphologies of Cu-doped ZnO crystal synthesized by the sol-gel route.75 The shoulder at 9000.5 eV in all the doped lms is due to the substitution of Cu in the Zn lattice. Also, the likenesses of the oscillations and magnitude of the Zn K-edge k3-weighted EXAFS spectra for both bare ZnO and doped lms show the substitution of Zn by Cu without distortion. The similarities between Zn and Cu K-edge in EXAFS analysis show the development of ZnO-like wurtzite structure around the Cu atom with Cu(II) oxidation state.

Agarwal et al.17 synthesized copper-doped ZnO by neutral beam sputtering techniques and reported the absence of any structural distortion at low dopant concentration. However, increasing the dopant concentration results in the development of the copper peaks on the XRD pattern. From the optical properties obtained by UV-vis spectral analysis, the bandgap energy of Cu-doped ZnO (15%) was obtained to be smaller (2.8 eV) than the ZnO bandgap energy (3.4 eV). This is probably due to the interband transition within the Zn 4s and Cu 3d bands. As is well interpreted on the surface plasmon resonance analysis, at a lower concentration, the doped material reveals the host behavior. On increasing above the optimum value, the material can exhibit dual behavior. With the help of XANES spectra, the substitution of empty ZnO d states by Cu(II) with trace amounts of Cu(I) was conrmed. A consistent XAS-based XANES Cu(I) substitution result was interpreted in another work.72 In addition to XANES, the substitution of cuprous state (Cu(I)) in the ZnO lattice was conrmed by XPS analysis.76 The sealed microspheres/semispherical shell morphology of the Cu-doped ZnO composite was synthesized by chemical vapor deposition techniques.
In addition to XAS, XPS analysis was also used to understand the doped copper oxidation states.20 Herein, the Cu-doped ZnO material was synthesized by radiofrequency magnetron sputtering technique from ZnO and CuO powders. XPS analysis revealed the presence of both Cu(II) and Cu(I) oxidation states with Cu(I) in the interstitial position. Besides, increasing the dopant concentration results in a reduction in the amount of Cu(II) oxidation state and increasing the Cu(I) oxidation state. The ZnO and CuO powders were also used to synthesize Cudoped ZnO lms deposited using pulsed laser deposition technique under an oxygen partial pressure of 10À3 and 10À5 torr.77 The composition, chemical state, and oxidation states of doped copper were analyzed by XPS analysis. In the oxygendecient sample (10À3 torr partial pressure), the Cu(I) state is dominant, while the Cu(II) state is in the oxygen-rich sample (10À5 torr partial pressure). The method used to synthesize Cudoped ZnO material, reagent, substrate, or surfactants, and the dopped Cu oxidation state are given in Table 3.
2.3. Bi-metallic/co-doped ZnO
The precise position and distribution of the dopant can create shallow defect levels in the host matrix and tune the properties of the materials toward a specic application. Recently, two kinds of element doping into the semiconductor lattice have attracted substantial interest as it could result in unusual characteristics compared with one element doping.18 p-type doping and n-type doping were found to be difficult for low VB maximum and high CB minimum energy, respectively.78 Thus, concurrently integrating the n-type and p-type dopants can be a feasible solution for the aforementioned problems. Also, co-doping increases the activation rate, dopant solubility, and carrier mobility. The Cu-Bi codoped ZnO nanospheres were synthesized by sol-gel-assisted hydrothermal method.79 From the XRD pattern, the doping of Bi and Cu separately showed a lower angle and higher angle diffraction peak shi owing to

the respective higher and small size, compared to Zn size. This is attributed to the expansion and contraction of the ZnO lattice during Bi and Cu substitution, respectively. The high-resolution scan XPS analysis conrms, the Bi3+ to be the major dopant chemical state. Besides, the main peak for the O 1s XPS spectrum of Cu-Bi codoped ZnO is divided into ve different peaks. Among these ve peaks, the peak obtained at the binding energy of 530.54 eV and 532.18 eV t with Cu-O and Bi-O, respectively. The photocatalytic activity of Cu-Bi codoped ZnO is greater than ZnO, which is ascribed to the bandgap reduction for codoped materials, compared to Cu-, Bi-doped ZnO, and bare ZnO.
Spherical Cu and Ag NPs anchored on the surface of the ZnO materials synthesized by the green method showed UV-vis absorption spectra intensity reduction and greater photocatalytic activity.80 This local heterojunction between Ag/Cu NPs and ZnO was further conrmed by XPS analysis. The optical properties' adjustment, attributed to the characteristics of Co+2 d-d transitions in the Fe-Co codoped ZnO, were also clearly shown by Beltr´an et al.81 The presence of Fe and Co resulted in more charge transfer, which improved the ferromagnetic properties. The improvement in the optical and ferromagnetism properties ascribed to codoping (Co-Mn codoped ZnO) was also reported in Pragna et al.'s study.82 The Ni-Cu codoped ZnO spherical materials synthesized by the wet hydrolysis approach were shown to have pronounced PL spectra intensity reduction than bare and Ni- and Cu-doped ZnO counterparts.83 The codoped material showed complete quenching of the UV emission and growth of broad two visible emission bands at 380 nm and 460 nm, which is attributed to the Ni and Co dopant, respectively, indicating their ability to serve as UV photodetectors.

The use of codoped ZnO as a photodetector was also studied in depth by GuruSampath et al.84 The heterostructured ZnO/Ga- Ag codoped ZnO nanorod material was synthesized by the twostep process, sol-gel-assisted hydrothermal approach. A slight lower angle shi was observed in the XRD pattern of the codoped material, which makes it confusing to interpret the effect based on the ionic radii because Ga(III) has a smaller ionic radius (0.62 A°) than Zn(II) (0.74 A°) and Ag(I) has a greater radius (1.02 A°) than zinc ion. The incorporation of bimetallic dopant showed a superior (nearly 20 times) PL emission intensity drop, which increases additional CB electrons and also reduces the material bandgap. The fabricated codoped heterostructured nanorod UV-photodetector showed two times greater photoresponse compared to bare ZnO at 13.5 mW cmÀ2 UV power density.
In addition to transition metal doping, nonmetal doping participates in band narrowing and amends the materials property toward visible light absorption. Transition metal ion (Cu) as a p-type and non-metal ion (N) as n-type codoped ZnO porous material were synthesized by Gupta et al.63 using the combustion and hydrothermal methods. The materials were synthesized by keeping the amount of N constant and increasing the amount of copper. From the XRD pattern analysis, increasing the amount of copper showed lattice contraction, which is attributed to the substitution of smaller Cu ionic radii with greater Zn ionic radius. In this study, the absorption of light in the visible region and bandgap narrowing were seen for N-Cu codoped ZnO than Cu-, N-doped, and bare ZnO. The incorporation of both Cu (Cu(I) and C(II)) and N in the ZnO lattice were also conrmed by the XPS analysis. Herein, the creation of a sub-energy level band below the host CB and above the VB was suggested due to the transition metal and nonmetal doping, respectively. The created sub-energy level acts as

a photogenerated electron-hole sink, thus prolonging electron- hole recombination.
Besides, Ce-Ag codoped-ZnO material prepared by the solvothermal method also showed a superior surface area and optical property improvement.18 Compared to bare ZnO, the codoped-ZnO material showed approximately ve times lesser average crystallite size. The greater the surface area, the higher the sorption properties and the greater the photon-assisted degradation. The redshi in the optical spectra occurred due to a new energy level in the DRS spectra, which is attributed to the existence of noble contact between the host and the dopant (Ag-ZnO-Ce). Besides, the lower PL intensity for the codoped sample compared to the bare ZnO also shows the lessening of electron-hole recombination. The smaller the recombination, the higher the Naphthol Blue Black dye degradation in aqueous solution under solar light irradiation. The photo-generated electron transfer from the ZnO CB to both the doped Ce and Ag metals was also reported by reducing the electron-hole recombination synergistically.
In addition to the magnetic and optical properties, the electrical properties of ZnO were also boosted by the doping of Cu in the ZnO lattice and further decorating it with different percentages of Ag (Ag@Cu-ZnO). Small peaks ascribed to Cu and Ag and higher angle shi owing to interstitial site impurity incorporation were detected in the XRD pattern. The increase in the average crystallite size with increasing Ag amount was attributed to the replacement of greater size Ag ion (1.26 A°) with smaller size Zn ion (0.74 A°). In this study, the incorporation of Cu into the ZnO lattice was understood from the FTIR band shi. The method used to synthesize Ag-Cu codoped ZnO

material, reagents, substrate/surfactants, and the morphology of the synthesized material are also given in Table 4.
3. Characterization techniques
A combination of characterization techniques should be applied for understanding the efficient doping of the dopant into the host lattice. The optical, compositional, crystalline phase change analyses are common to study the dopant characteristics. X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis/DRS, and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy or mass spectrometry (ICP-AES/MS) are normally used for understanding the change in the lattice parameters, bandgap modications, and atomic percentage, respectively. The changes in the lattice parameters, such as contraction/expansion, which occurred due to the difference in the size of the host and the dopant, further creates a change in the electronic structure of the host materials. However, using the XRD pattern, the visualization of the evenly distributed doped materials is impossible. Besides, characterization techniques such as electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PLS), and X-ray absorption (XAS), including X-ray absorption ne structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, are used for understanding the local coordination environment (chemical states), optical properties, and magnetic properties of the dopant.86,87 The near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption ne structure (EXAFS) indicates the dopant substitution and bond distance between the dopant and the host, respectively.19 Since all elements have characteristics of core binding energy, EXAFS is used for analyzing the local

structure of all the elements. In addition, the development of the atomic-resolution characterization technique helps in the precise imaging of dopant atoms' location and distribution.
Advanced hyphenated instruments such as annular darkeld scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADFSTEM)22 and EELS-STEM62 provide the actual three-dimensional location and distribution, as well as element-specic analysis of the isolated impurities in the host matrix. ADF-STEM is an advanced instrument, which works by scanning the surface of the sample by focused electron beam and collecting the scattered electron by the annular dark-eld detector. Higher atomic number impurities, which have different contrast compared to the host, can be detected as an image, which is difficult for small atomic number elements. Based on the characteristic core-edge electron-energy-loss signal, the single-atom sensitive EELS technique is also used to detect the dopant.22 Postica et al. used the high angle annular dark-eld (HAADF)-STEM imaging technique for exact Ag-doped size measurement.21
3.1. STEM with different detectors Controlling the position and distribution of doped light and heavy metal elements improves the device application potential. Besides, noticing the dopant-induced defects (point or/and extended) and heterogeneities89 gives information for tailoring the properties of the material. The 0D defects (dopants and vacancies), 1D defects (inclusion and dislocations), grain boundaries, and van der Waals gaps are the main dopantinduced structural disorders.90 This position, distribution, and disorder in materials, which affect the characteristics of the materials, can be identied by STEM analytical technique with

atomic resolution.91 The working principle of the STEM technique is based on the idea of the angular selection of the scattered signal, in which the detector collects only the electrons scattered to large angles and avoids the Bragg reections.92 As shown in Fig. 5(a), the various lenses assist the magnetic elds and the aberration corrector passes the beam to the EELS and other various modes of STEM detectors without affecting its energy. Fig. 5(b) show the electron beam monochromation, in which the transmitted beam is dispersed on the prism and detected on the EELS detector.88 The STEM technique detects both the small atomic number and large atomic number elements by annular dark-eld (ADF-STEM) as bright spots and annular bright-eld (ABF-STEM) as dark spots imaging, respectively. The BF-STEM has small-, middle-, and large-angle categories, in which the middle angle bright-eld STEM (MABFSTEM) is used for detecting low atomic number elements with high accuracy.
Bazioti et al. used a STEM technique to validate the role of nitrogen doping in the evolution of point (vacancies and interstitials) and extended (stacking faults) defects.93 Multiple detectors (ABF, ADF, and HAADF) were used to simultaneously detect the chemical information and atomic structure of the material. The common HAADF detector correlated to the Zcontrast detects the Z-contrast image scattered from the doped heavy metals. The ADF detector gives information based on the strong diffraction contrast by selecting the angular range of the scattered electrons. Here, in the ADF detector, the existence of an extended defect is easily sensed. The BF detector can be used for the detection of light and heavy elements simultaneously by aligning the detector with all/part of the unscattered probe. The ABF detector operates by removing the circle from the center of the detector. The electronic and compositional information is collected using the EELS spectroscopic technique.93,94 Currently, the 4D-STEM modes of imaging detector, commonly known as scanning electron nanodiffraction, is an advanced technology used for crystal orientation mapping of any dopant. It gathers all types of real-space atomic-resolution images by collecting all diffraction datasets from each electron probe with high-speed and efficient detection.95
In Tang et al.'s study, the in situ substitution and distribution of niobium on the surface of transition metal dichalcogenides for the modication of the electronic structure was clearly visualized in the HAADF-STEM images.96 Strontium dopantinduced tetragonal phase to cubic phase structural transition on barium titanate was conrmed from powder XRD analysis.97 This solid result obtained from the XRD pattern was further conrmed from HAADF-STEM, in which the phase change results from the substantial compositional and microstructural inhomogeneities. Wen et al. detected both the low Z-C atoms and high Z-Mo atoms simultaneously by the ADF-STEM techniques. Remarkably, the 2D pixelated electron detector was used here to capture the low Z-number atoms convergent beam electron diffraction patterns in a 4D STEM geometry. From the ADF (LAADF), BF, and ABF STEM modes, the atomic sites in bright contrast to MoS2 and WS2 and the holes in dark contrast due to the carbon-based contamination, which result from

either organic solvent residue or microscope vacuum, were clearly identied.98
The effect of transition metal dopant-induced oxygen vacancies on the photocatalytic activities was reported by Kim et al.99 Cr doping in the ZnO matrix showed a signicant positive effect on the photocatalytic degradation of 4-chlorophenol and formic acid contaminates, whereas a negative result was seen for Co doping. As understood from the multimodal characterization techniques (STEM-EDX and E STEM-EELS), the occurrence of Cr+3, which has a charge mismatch with ZnO, induces higher vacancies in the ZnO crystal. The charge mismatch between two transition metal ions boosts the charge transfer properties. The doping of bismuth (Bi) in the tin oxide (SnOx) for fascinating catalytic properties was also reported.101 The Bi dopant position and distribution in Bi-SnOx synthesized from SnCl2 and BiI3 precursors were investigated by HAADFSTEM and EDX-STEM techniques.
Crystallographic defects detection based on ADF-STEM oneclass support vector machine were proposed by Guo et al.102 ZrO2 and bilayer (MoW)Te2 grown from bulk crystal were used for their experimental detection of point, line (in 2D), and boundary (in 3D) defects. HAADF-STEM image-based dopantsegregation induced atomic-scale fractures arising within the Al2O3 ceramic grain boundary core were also conrmed by Kondo et al.103 Loche et al. optimized the maximum (7.5%) lanthanum doping in the CeO2 matrix, which possesses an outstanding oxygen storage capacity. In this study, the dopantinduced oxygen vacancy stabilization, shape, and size of the NPs were optimized using a surfactant-mediated hydrosolvothermal synthetic approach. Fig. 6 shows the conventional TEM, HRTEM, aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM, and EDS-STEM image of La-doped CeO2. From these characterization techniques, the cubic shape and d-spacing conrm the material authenticity, homogeneous distribution of La, and amounts of La.100
4. Doped colloidal nanocrystal frameworks
In addition to doping, tuning the NMs into a subordinate structure to form colloidal nanoparticle clusters (CNCs) and then assembling to the colloidal nanocrystal frameworks (CNFs) allows the material to have a combination of properties, which did not exist in the original constituents. The secondary structure, which is organized by optimizing the surfactants, solvents, and reaction temperatures, also regulates the geometry and consequently becomes functional for chosen applications. Thus, a CNCs is an inorganic core, which is shaped following the nucleation and growth steps, stabilized by surfactants molecules in the solution.104 Similarly, CNFs are ordered arrangements of porous CNCs material containing both matter and void space.105,106 The CNFs may have (1) microporous pore size distribution such as MOFs and zeolites,107,108 (2) mesoporous,23,109 and macroporous distribution, which employs hard or so templates to form the framework.

Inset shows the corresponding 2D-FFT. (C) HAADF-AC-STEM image of the same nanocubes, showing the scan region imaged for EDS mapping, (D and E) EDS maps showing the distribution of Ce and La throughout the nanocubes, respectively. The EDS overall quantification indicates a molar percentage of Ce and La of 94.5% and 5.5%, respectively.100
During CNFs growth, rst, the molecular precursors were decomposed in the presence of template-forming surfactants by stepwise heating at moderate temperatures. The direct calcination of the colloidal particles synthesized without the template-forming surfactant provides disordered nanoparticles, while it provides ordered nanoparticles if the surfactant is used. Subsequent room and different temperature aging (inorganic condensation/encapsulation), evaporation, and crystallization yield the ordered mesoporous inorganic framework. Aer thermal or chemical processing (chemicals such as CH2Cl2 (ref. 27)), the self-supporting properties of the CNFs are understood from an instrument such as SEM and grazing incidence smallangle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) analysis.105 Although, the surfactants stabilize the nanoparticle during synthesis, however, they protect the target NPs from the light source, which diminishes the material applications such as catalysis and bio-separation. Thus, post-assembly of the CNFs, calcination/chemical processing treatment is used to form wellstructured and clean porous framework architecture stabilized by thermal fusion (Fig. 7).5,110 However, high-temperature treatment for purifying the CNFs assists the framework crosslinking or/and aggregation/agglomeration process, which increases the crystallite sizes.
The frameworks can be synthesized either from molecular precursors or from the pre-formed CNCs, using the block copolymer architecture-directing agent (ADA) as nanocrystal tethering and a pore-generating domain.111 The chimie douce single molecular precursor's approach using zinc and copper ketoacidooximates precursor was applied by Pashchanka et al.

to dope Cu ion into the ZnO host matrix.27 From different spectroscopic and microscopic examinations, the oxidation state of copper was found to be Cu(II).
Advanced methods such as sol-gel and solvo-/hydrothermal were reported112 to control the size, shape, dispersity, and geometry of the framework. During the synthesis, the interaction between the CNCs and ADA needs to be electrostatic rather than van der Waals or hydrogen bonding, which can resist thermal processing.113-115 The thermal treatment applied to transfer the precursor to active atomic or molecular species may go to up to 320 C, and be grown to the NMs, then assembled into cluster. The layer-by-layer (LBL), liquid-liquid interface (LLI), and evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) are some of the approaches used to assemble the pre-formed NPs. Frequently, the EISA that follows the evaporation of the solvent in the presence of block copolymer utilizes crystalline NPs instead of molecular precursors.116,117 The LBL approach is the process of adsorption of the NPs on the surface of submicrometer beads.118 The LLI is formed at the interface of two immiscible liquids.119
The size can be controlled by changing the concentration of the ligands or precursors and stopping the growth at different steps, while the shape can be controlled by the selective adhesion of ligands to specic crystalline facets.104 Compared to ligand-coated NCs copolymer ADA interaction, the ligand-stripped NCs are suggested to avoid the stability issue.120 From a surface chemistry perspective, copolymers such as poly(4-vinyl pyridine) (P4VP) are promising toward organic-organic interaction,121 while the surface charge on the NCs and the type of the copolymer is reported104,106 to be the most important consideration for copolymer selection

toward organic-inorganic interaction. For instance, an ordered mesoporous structure was synthesized by Buonsanti et al. using poly(N,N-dimethyl acrylamide) and porogenic polystyrene block copolymer structure-directing agents.114 During synthesis, different block copolymer ratios and molecular weights were taken to optimize the mesoporosity. The group used the reversible addition- fragmentation chain transfer polymerization ligandstripped NCs approach.
The residual surface charge on molecular precursors (metal cation or/and hydroxyl-terminated metal oxide NCs) can be generated by solvothermal or sol-gel methods.106 Thermally heating the assembled composite led to the formation of hexagonal phase-segregated morphology and then well-ordered CNFs on further thermal processing.113 In this regard, the distinctive recyclability/stability and rate performance of metal oxide semiconductor-based CNFs make them a suitable choice.114
5. Applications
5.1. Bacterial activity
Nowadays, several conventional antibiotic resistant-bacteria have been emerging, leading to enhanced infections in human beings. Thus, searching for safe and effective antimicrobial agents for therapeutic and non-therapeutic purposes has been continuously encouraged. In recent decades, nanomaterials such as metal oxides have shown novel bactericidal potential. The antibacterial action is believed to have taken place when the negatively charged bacterial cells electrostatically interact with the positively charged metal oxides NPs.122 The cell wall of Gram-negative (GN) bacteria is complex and has

a higher negative potential due to the presence of the lipopolysaccharide layer, compared to the Gram-positive (GP) bacteria.123 This complex structure and negatively charged behavior of the GN bacteria shield the negatively charged reactive oxygen species (ROS) and avoid their absorption.124
The bactericidal mechanism of NPs is limited, although the direct and indirect interactions were reported as the main mechanisms.125 The direct mechanism occurs by the direct interaction of the positively charged NPs with negatively charged microorganisms.126 The indirect mechanism occurs through the interaction of the NPs with the intercellular space.127 The direct and indirect mechanism can damage the bacterial cell through the generation of ROS, by the release of ions, and NPs interaction with the cell membrane.128-130 The ROS generation is dependent on the interaction of the NPs with light that results in the generation of electrons and holes. The photo-induced electrons and holes further react with oxygen and water to form a highly oxidizing agent, hydroxyl radical (OHc). Photocatalytic ROS generation under visible light irradiation for the inactivation of E. coli by Ag-doped ZnO has been reported in different works.132,133
The three important features that play a vital role in the generation of ROS are active redox cycling, the presence of prooxidant functional groups on the surface of NPs, and cell- particle interactions.134 The change in the electronic properties and reduction in the particle size produce reactive groups on the surface of the NPs. These reactive sites are the center of interaction between molecular oxygen and electron donor/ acceptor active sites, which result in the formation of O2À. The generated O2À damage the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in the electron transport chain, releasing more ferrous ions, and these ferrous ions are oxidized by the Fenton reaction for generating moreOHc.135,136 Antibacterial activity through the release of Ag+ ions from Ag-SiO2 NCs was proposed by Cui et al. As seen in Fig. 8, the electrostatic force of interaction between the positively charged NCs and negatively charged bacterial cells led to the release of Ag+ ions and transported them to the cytoplasm. The direct interaction of Ag+ with the mitochondria results in the generation of ROS by the Fenton reaction and inhibits DNA replication. Aer the interaction of the NCs and bacterial cells, the disruption of the membrane/cell wall and change in the bacterial cell morphology from cylindrical to spherical shape was also observed in the TEM analysis.131
ZnO NPs have good antibacterial performance against both GP and GN bacteria. In addition, the antibacterial activities of copper and silver were also reported,137 although the bactericidal activities of Ag NPs would be diminished as a result of its oxidation and aggregation behavior.131 In Wang et al.'s study138 signicant antibacterial activities of Ag-doped ZnO were reported, compared to the single ZnO NPs, which results from the synergistic effect of both Ag and ZnO. In this work, since no visible/UV light was applied during the antibacterial study, bacterial damage by the release of Zn+2/Ag+ ions or/and Ag/ZnO NPs interaction with cell membrane was proposed to be the probable mechanism for bacterial death. Similar synergistic effect antibacterial activities owing to the band structure modication through dopant inclusion were also proposed in

Fig. 8 Schematic of the antibacterial mechanism of the SiO2-Ag composites.131
Zare et al.'s139 studies. The disruption of the bacterial cell membrane at a cellular level and the inhibition of DNA/proteins at a molecular level by either Zn2+/Ag+ ions or ROS formation were proposed in Matai et al.'s140 study. Herein, cell membrane shrinkage due to disruption, followed by the leakage of intracellular materials, was clearly supported by FE-SEM, AFM, and TEM analysis. Hydrothermally synthesized Cu-doped ZnO by Khalid et al.141 also veried the synergistic antibacterial effect, especially on GP bacteria (results of structural differences among GP and GN bacteria) with a superior zone of inhibition. ROS generation by the Fenton-type reaction following the release of ions (Zn2+, Cu, Cu+, and Cu2+) is a probable mechanism for the bacterial inactivation/death in this study.
5.2. Photocatalytic activity
The rapid photo-induced electron-hole recombination and narrow light-absorption range are believed to diminish the photocatalytic efficiency of ZnO.142 The doping of metal reduces the electron-hole recombination by forming a Schottky junction, also improves the crystalline transformation, visible light absorption, and materials' surface area-to-volume ratio.143 Such doping also affects the optical, electrical, and magnetic properties. Yang et al. synthesized Ag-doped ZnO in the presence of higher surface area zeolitic imidazolate framework-8. The doped Ag metal acts as an electron capture site from the CB of ZnO and helps to improve the electron-hole separation, and this in turn enhances the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B dye.144 The electron capturing properties of Ag in Ag- ZnO resulted due to the establishment of the Ag/ZnO Fermi level between the CB and Fermi level of pure ZnO, which is known as a Schottky junction (more negative Fermi level potential for Ag-ZnO than bare ZnO).145,146

The doping of copper also creates an electron acceptor level and modies the ZnO crystal band structure, and it further enhances the visible light absorption efficiency of the material. Using hydrated zinc and copper acetate precursors in the presence of citrate and the dropwise addition of NaOH, Ma et al. synthesized porous Cu-doped ZnO NCs for MB dye degradation. The improved degradation behavior of Cu-doped ZnO than bare ZnO was reasonably explained as the occurrence of interfacial charge transfer from ZnO to Cu dopant (Fig. 9(c) and (d)). For single ZnO, aer the excitation of the photo-induced electron to the CB, it directly returns to the VB and recombines with a hole (Fig. 9(c)). However, the excited electron on the Cu-ZnO nanocomposite would be accepted by Cu+2 and then reduced to Cu+, which further extends the life span of the hole in the VB (Fig. 9(d)).142 As a result, the reduction of oxygen by electron and oxidation of water by the hole occurred.
Thus, an intermediate oxidizing agent and hydroxyl radical are generated.
To understand the detailed photocatalytic dye degradation mechanism, testing the existence of ROS and a free hole is important. Karthik et al.147 used isopropyl alcohol and 1,4benzoquinone as a O2À and OHc trapper, and ammonium oxalate as a hole trapper on the surface of Cu-doped ZnO NCs. In the presence of a hole trapper, greater than 85% dye degradation took place, whereas only about <20% degradation took place in the presence of ROS trapper. Hence, the ROS is the main degradation species of the dyes (MB, indigo carmine, and rhodamine B) compared to the hole under UV light irradiation. Here, in this work, the 3% and 5% dopant concentrations showed better degradation activity compared to the 7% and 9% doped NCs. The reason for the diminishing photocatalytic activities with an increase in the dopant amount is the development of CuO that covers the ZnO surface, which signicantly shields the UV absorption capacity of the material. The

development of CuO also acts as a photo-induced electron-hole recombination center. This shielding and recombination center properties of the developed CuO (doping above 5%) were also explained by Kuriakose et al.148 The improvement in the degradation of the MB dye with increasing Cu percentage up to 5% was reported by Okeke et al. Herein, the degradation on the doped nanocomposite resulted from the occurrence of ZnO bandgap shrinkage and developments of different types of defects in the ZnO matrix during Cu doping.149
Simultaneously doping two metals generates special characteristics and results in a higher photodegradation activity.18 Subash et al. synthesized Ce and Ag co-doped ZnO superstructures for the photocatalytic degradation of naphthol blue-black dye under solar light irradiation. Both the adsorption and photocatalytic activities of Ag and Ce co-doped ZnO NCs are higher than those of bare ZnO NPs, Ce-ZnO, and Ag-ZnO NCs. This indicates that co-doping results in increased surface active sites by increasing the overall surface area and photocatalytic activity resulting from the interfacial charge transfer from ZnO to Ce and Ag dopant as shown in Fig. 9(a) and (b).18 MB dye degradation and bactericidal activities' improvement as a result of synergistic effect (Sn/Cu co-doped ZnO), interfacial charge transfer, and creation of extrinsic defects were also reported by Shanmugam et al.150 The ve cycle recyclability test also proved the stability of the Sn/Cu-co-doped ZnO materials with an insignicant potential reduction in the 5th cycle. These Sn/Cuco-doped ZnO materials synthesized by microwave-assisted coprecipitation approach also showed superior antibacterial activity against GN and GP bacteria. In addition to antibacterial and photocatalytic applications, tuning the materials to have an interconnected porous framework improves the mass- or iontransport properties in several elds such as adsorption,151 capacitors/storage,152 electrocatalysis,153 windows,154 and sensors.155

6. Conclusions and future outlook
Nanotechnology is a fundamental eld for producing advanced materials with interesting properties and unusual application potentials. Nanocrystals synthesized by common approaches have had essential applications for several years. Precise inclusion and good distribution of the impurities in the nanocrystal semiconductor materials further advance the material properties toward a particular application. For the precise inclusion and distribution of the dopant, controlling several conditions such as host-dopant and surfactant hardness, reaction time, and synthetic approach are signicant. Common instruments (XRD, TEM, XAS, and XPS) can give information about the properties of the doped materials. In addition, advanced imaging modes of the STEM technique have been valued in direct atomic level defect and visualization of heterointerfaces and their impact on the properties of materials. Thus, the detection of the defects position, distribution, composition, and level of defects has received attention and should also be future viewpoints, especially in the case of in situ STEM control. In addition, forming a secondary structure, a colloidal nanocrystals framework can enhance the mass-/ion

transport properties. Thus, tuning the crucial parameters under the control of advanced instruments and modifying the nanocrystals to the secondary structure should be the nonstop evolution for the future.

Promotion of cytoplasmic localization of oligonucleotides by connecting cross-linked duplexes
Yu Hirano  and Yasuo Komatsu *
We previously reported that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) flanked by duplexes can suppress microRNA (miRNA) function with high efficiency for a long duration. In this study, we examined the effect of the double-stranded structure on the subcellular localization of ASOs. Double strands were cross-linked to prevent dissociation into single strands, and this cross-linked duplex (CD) was connected at the 50 or 30 termini of an antisense-targeting miRNA-21 (AS). The subcellular distribution of fluorescently labelled ASOs was analyzed following transfection into cells. While single-stranded AS molecules promptly moved to the nucleus, AS with the CD at the 50-end (50CD-AS) interestingly showed significantly higher cytoplasmic localization. The 30-CD-modified AS (30CD-AS) was degraded from the 50-end of the AS, but the degradation was prevented by 50-end chemical modifications, thereby allowing the imaging of the cytoplasmic localization. The CD modification significantly promoted the cytoplasmic localization of ASOs and enabled the effective knockdown of miRNA existing in cytoplasm. These results reveal that the duplex structure has promising potential to control the subcellular distribution of ASOs.

Introduction
Single stranded antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are widely used for controlling gene expression in a sequence-specic manner.1-3 ASOs are divided into two categories based on their functional mechanisms: Ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1)mediated RNA cleavage and steric blocking. Endogenous RNase H1 binds to an RNA-DNA heteroduplex and degrades the RNA4; however, fully 20-modied ASOs cannot induce RNase Hmediated RNA cleavage.5 Gapmer ASOs containing deoxynucleotides anked by several modied nucleotides on both ends can induce RNase H1-mediated RNA cleavage at the gap region.6 The 20-modications can improve ASO/RNA binding affinity and nuclease resistance.7 Among these gapmer ASOs, bL-locked nucleic acid (LNA) has attracted considerable interst.8,9 The phosphodiester (PO) backbone linkage in an ASO is also frequently replaced by a phosphorothioate (PS) linkage to enhance nuclease resistance and binding with various proteins, such as plasma proteins.10-14
These chemical modications affect cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of ASOs.15 PS-modied ASOs (PS-ASOs) are taken up by scavenger receptors, which mediate ASO

internalization into the cells.16 PS-ASOs can be selectively delivered into liver hepatocytes by conjugation with N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNac), because asialoglycoprotein receptor mediates the uptake of GalNac-conjugated PS-ASOs into hepatocytes.3,17 However, the effects of intracellular distribution on ASO activity is not fully understood.15,16 The intracellular trafcking and localization of ASOs can be monitored using uorescence microscopy.18-20 Single-stranded PO-ASOs and PS-ASOs accumulate in the nucleus following lipofection or microinjection.18-20 In contrast, aer cells internalize gapmer PS-ASOs with LNA modications in the absence of transfection reagents, the PS-ASOs become localized in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm.19 Moreover, when gapmer PS-ASOs are introduced into cells without transfection reagents, ASO subcellular localization is affected by the 20-modications at both ends.15,21 Although the subcellular localization of PS-ASOs depends on different binding proteins,22,23 single-stranded PO-ASOs rarely interact with proteins in cells and are primarily distributed to the nucleus.18,24
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous noncoding RNAs (20-23 nucleotides) that regulate gene expression. In the nucleus, miRNAs are transcribed as pri-miRNA, and processed into a hairpin-shaped pre-miRNA. Next, the pre-miRNA is exported to the cytoplasm and one of the strands of the duplex associates with the Argonaute protein to form a miRNA-RISC complex that engages the target mRNA to mediate gene silencing.25,26 The discovery that miRNAs have important roles in various physiological processes and the pathogenesis of diseases26,27 has led to ASOs targeted toward miRNA, which are

also known as antagomiRs, antimir, or anti-microRNA oligonucleotides, to become an important tool for investigating miRNA function. ASOs bind to miRNA through complementary sequences, thereby inhibiting the function of the miRNA in cells.28-31 Additionally, the double-stranded duplexes anking the antimir improve the inhibitory effects.32-34 Recently, we constructed an ASO anked by an interstrand cross-linked duplex (CD) of 20-O-methylated RNA and found that the CD attenuated the anti-miRNA activity of the ASO.35 Compared with other structured ASOs, ASO anked by CDs at the 50- and 30termini (CD-AS) exhibit higher inhibitory activity in cells. For example, CD-AS effectively suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells.36,37 In addition, the activity of CD-AS constructs is target-specic, and the expression level of PTEN mRNA, which is a target of miR-21, was shown to be upregulated by CD-AS in breast cancer cells.36 Moreover, antimiRNA activity, nuclease resistance, and the miRNA modication prole in a CD-AS differ signicantly based on the CDconnected positions in the ASO. However, the relationship between the inhibitory activity and subcellular distribution of ASOs has not been eluciated.
In this study, we investigated the effect of duplex structures on the subcellular localization of ASOs. The cytosol localization of AS having the CD at the 50 end was much larger than that of AS with the CD at the 30 end. Moreover, the cytoplasmic localization of ASOs targeted toward miRNA signicantly correlated with their miRNA inhibitory activities. These results suggest the importance of the duplex structure in controlling the subcellular localization of oligonucleotides.
Results and discussion
Subcellular localization of oligonucleotides with a CD at the 50- or 30-end
MicroRNA-21 (miR-21), a cancer-promoting miRNA, is overexpressed in solid tumors.38 The effect of miR-21 can be suppressed by an ASO that has a complementary sequence.36,39,40 We previously examined the anti-miRNA activities of 20-Omethylated ASOs in which a 22-mer antisense (AS) was anked by perfectly matched double-strand or a CD at the 50- or 30-end of the AS. The CD was constructed from the bis-aminooxy linker mediated conjugation of two abasic sites in the center of the complementary 12-mer duplex.35,41 The 12-mer 20-O-methylated CD adopted a typical A-form structure that was identical to the standard duplex of Watson-Crick base pairs. The rigid conformation of the CD confers the potential to be highly resistant to nucleases and to thereby stabilize neighboring hybridization. A 50CD-AS having the CD at 50-end of AS has been shown to knockdown miR-21 more efficiently than a 30CD-AS having the CD at 30-end,35 although the reason for the difference in the antimiRNA activity was unclear. In this study, we focused on the subcellular localization of ASOs with or without doublestranded structures. ASs having single strand (ss) (50ss-AS), double strand (ds) (50ds-AS), hairpin loop (hp) (50hp-AS) or CD (50CD1-AS) at the 50-end were prepared (Fig. 1, 50X-AS). All of these oligonucleotides were synthesized from 20-O-methyl ribonucleotides with phosphodiester internucleotide (PO)

foci (Fig. 2A) that showed endosomes or lysosomes as seen in the lipofection-mediated transfections.20,42 Based on the calcein-AM and Hoechst 33342 uorescence staining images (Fig. S1), the total uorescence intensities of Alexa-Fluor 546 in the nucleus and cytoplasm were quantied for approximately
100 cells, and the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization ratios of
each oligonucleotide were determined, respectively (Fig. 2B). An AS with single strand and double strand at the 50-end (50ss-AS and 50ds-AS) displayed approximately two-fold more total uo-
rescence intensity in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm

both 50- and 30-ends of the AS (Fig. S1). Although ss-AS had the same molecular weight as 50CD1-AS (46 nts), ss-AS had a high nucleus localization (66%) similar to that of 50ss-AS (Fig. 2B). Notably, 50CD1-AS displayed a distinctly different behavior in cells from that of 50ds-AS and 50hp-AS that contained the stan-
dard duplex, despite the similar molecular weights of 46 and 50
nts, respectively (Fig. 2B). This difference in subcellular locali-
zation was derived from the duplex structures adjacent to the AS. The CD of 50CD1-AS was stable in cells because of the interstrand cross-link, whereas the duplexes of 50ds-AS and 50hp-AS were dissociated or degraded to provide short single strands such as 50ss-AS (Fig. 2). The 50CD-AS maintained cyto-
plasmic localization 48 h aer transfection (Fig. S3); however, 50ss-AS and 50ds-AS signicantly reduced the uorescence
intensities in cells aer 6 h, due to the degradation. We then prepared 30ss-AS, 30ds-AS, 30hp-AS, 30CD1-AS, and
30CD2-AS, based on the 22 nt AS with ss, ds, hp, and CD at the 30end, respectively (Fig. 1, 30X-AS), and analysed their intracellular localizations (Fig. 2A and S1). Similar to 50-modied ASs, all 30-
modied ASs produced several bright red foci in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A); however, the uorescence intensities of 30ss-AS, 30dsAS, and 30hp-AS were very weak, suggesting degradation in cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, both 30CD1-AS and 30CD2-AS were
clearly detected in the nucleus with a localization ratio of approximately 65% (Fig. 2B). The 30CD-AS maintained nuclear localization 48 h aer transfection (Fig. S3). Interestingly, this result differed from that observed with 50CD-AS despite their
identical molecular weight. The AS sequence of 50CD2-AS and 30CD2-AS was then
changed to the mismatched AS (mAS), the AS of microRNA-16
(R16), and a scrambled sequence (NC), respectively (Fig. S2). The 50CD- or 30CD-linked oligonucleotides maintained the same localization prole as the parent molecule (50CD2-AS or 30CD2AS, Fig. S4), conrming that the AS sequence does not affect
the subcellular localization. Moreover, the AS sequence was shortened from 22 nts to 0 or 12 nts (CD, 50CD-12, 30CD-12; Fig. S2). The percentages of nucleus localization of 50CD-12 (36 nts) slightly increased to 49% (Fig. 3) from 30% of 50CD2-

The 50CD1-AS, with the CD at the 50-end, signicantly
decreased the nuclear localization ratio from approximately 73% for 50ss-AS to 41% (Fig. 2B). Additionally, the 50CD2-AS had a similar nuclear localization ratio (30%) as that of 50CD1-AS (Fig. 2B). Since the 50ss-AS consisted of 34 nucleotides (nts), this had a lower molecular weight than that of 50CD1-AS,

AS (46 nts). The CD (24 nts) without the dangling sequence showed a nucleus localization (65%, Fig. 3) as high as the singlestranded ss-AS (Fig. 2B). In contrast, 30CD-12 (36 nts) interestingly showed no change in the nucleus localization ratio from 30CD2-AS or CD (Fig. 3), with a different localization prole from 50CD-linked sequences that demonstrated a dependence on molecular weight.
50-End modications of single-stranded oligonucleotides
The intracellular localization of 30CD-linked single strands was independent of the length or the sequence of the dangling regions. Therefore, we hypothesized that the dangling AS region of 30CD-AS might be degraded from the 50-terminal without any protecting groups. Nuclease resistance was conferred to AS by attaching a non-nucleotidyl propyl (C3)- or an amino (NH2)linker to the 50-end to create 30CD-C3AS and 30CD-NH2AS, respectively (Fig. 4A). The subcellular localization of these oligonucleotides was then examined. Surprisingly, both 30CDC3AS and 30CD-NH2AS were dominantly localized in the

cytoplasm (Fig. 4B), reducing the nuclear localization ratios to
approximately 35% (Fig. 4C), which is the same as those of 50CD-AS. Additionally, the phosphodiester bond between the rst and second nucleotides (50UC30) of the AS was changed to
a PS bond, which is highly resistant to nuclease digestion, to create 30CD-psAS (Fig. 4A). Aer transfection into cells, 30CDpsAS was mainly detected in the cytoplasm, similar to 30CDC3AS, 30CD-NH2AS or 50CD-AS with a protected 50-end on the AS (Fig. 4B and C). The dangling AS of 30CD-AS may be degraded in the cytoplasm by a 50-30exonuclease such as XRN,43 resulting in
the production of the CD domain, i.e., which was nuclease
resistant due to the rigid conformation. Since the CD domain is localized in the nucleus, as shown in Fig. 3, 30CD-AS exhibited
localization in the nucleus. These results indicate that the protection from the 50-30 cleavage is an important factor for ensuring prolonged antisense effects in cells. To evaluate the effect of 50 -end modication on localization of a singlestranded oligonucleotide, the 50 -end of 30ss-AS was modied with a propyl-linker to create 30ss-C3AS (Fig. 4A). Although 30ssAS without the 50 -terminal protection could not provide images because of prompt degradation (Fig. 2A), 30ss-C3AS could be detected in the nucleus (Fig. 4B and C). As shown in Fig. 2, 50ssAS which had an Alexa-Fluor residue at the 50 -end, also
exhibited nuclear localization. Taken together, these results
indicated that single-stranded oligonucleotides became stable in cells because of 50 -end protection but they are delivered to the nucleus unlike 30CD-C3AS.
We then directly analysed the stability of oligonucleotides with or without 50 -end protection in the cytoplasm. Aer 50CD2AS, 30CD2-AS, and 30CD-C3AS were transfected into cells, their
respective cytoplasmic fractions were recovered, followed by polyacrylamide gel analysis. 50CD2-AS was intact (lane cyto in Fig. 5A and S5), 30CD2-AS was degraded, whereas most 30CD-
C3AS molecules remained stable in the cytoplasm with a small
number of degraded products (Fig. 5A). These results were
consistent with those derived from the imaging analyses. The stability of single-stranded 30ss-AS, 30ss-C3AS, and ss-AS was also examined. Most 30ss-AS molecules without 50-protection were degraded in the cytoplasm (Fig. S6). In contrast, 30ss-C3AS and ss-AS with the propyl and Alexa-Fluor residues at the 50-end (Fig. S6), respectively, were resistant to degradation. These results conrmed that a 50-end modication such as a CD or the
non-nucleotidyl linker could protect the single-stranded AS
region from degradation in the cytoplasm.

Inhibition of miRNAs is associated with cytoplasmic localization of ASOs
There was increased cytoplasm localization of 30CD-yASs (y ¼ C3, NH2, ps) due to the y-modications at the 50-end of the AS (Fig. 4). We then evaluated the anti-miRNA activities of the oligonucleotides 48 h aer transfection using a dual-luciferase assay. A target sequence complementary to the mature miR-21 was inserted into the 30-UTR of the Renilla luciferase (hRluc) gene of the psiCHECK-2 vector, which contained both hRluc and rey luciferase (Fluc) genes in a single plasmid. When the vector and ASOs are introduced into cells, the effects of

the cytoplasmic localization ratio of the ASOs. The miRNAs are
loaded into the Argonaute protein to form a miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC), which then binds the 30-UTR of mRNA in the cytoplasm.25,44,45 Therefore, the increase in ASO
concentration in the cytoplasm is advantageous for the associ-
ation between ASOs and their target miRNAs.
Fig. 6 summarizes these results. The dangling AS part of 30CD-AS was degraded in the cytoplasm, producing the CD
domain, which is resistant to nuclease degradation because of
the interstrand cross-linking. When the CD was transfected into
cells, the CD was translocated to the nucleus (Fig. 3). Thus, 30CD-AS was apparently localized in the nucleus (I in Fig. 6). Single-stranded ss-AS, 50ss-AS, and 30ss-C3AS with 50-end
protections were stable in the cytoplasm (II in Fig. 6) but most of them moved to the nucleus. Both 50CD-AS and 30CD-yAS (y ¼ C3, NH2 and ps) were stable in cytoplasm because of the CD and the y moiety at the 50-end of the AS and were suppressed from
migrating to the nucleus (III in Fig. 6). These localization proles increased the concentrations of 50CD-AS and 30CD-yAS in the cytoplasm, resulting in the effective knockdown of
miRNA acting in cytoplasm. Notably, 50CD-AS, 30CD-yAS, and ss-AS showed different
localization proles despite their identical molecular weight of 46 nts; therefore, the differences in localization were likely due to the differences in structure. A single-stranded oligonucleotide adopts a exible and compactly folded random-coil struc-
ture. As the result, a single-stranded oligonucleotide might pass
through nuclear pores from the cytoplasm. In contrast, the
single dangling strand may be preorganized to have an
extended form by the connection with a CD due to the rigid rodlike structure of the CD.46 Therefore, the CD-connected AS
having with a bulky conformation may be suppressed from been
translocated to the nucleus. These results suggest that the CD modication can promote the accumulation of single-stranded
ASOs in the cytoplasm.

endogenous miR-21 function can be monitored by measuring
the relative expression of hRluc and Fluc. The ratio of hRluc/
Fluc were normalized using the ratio of psiCHECK-2-treated cells without ASO. The 30CD2-AS without the 50-end modication displayed little suppression of miR-21, although 30CD-yASs could suppress miR-21 to the same degree as 50CD2-AS (Fig. 5B). The same results were also obtained for unlabelled 30CD-yASs (Fig. S7). Single-stranded 30ss-C3AS with a high nuclear localization ratio did not suppress miR-21. These results conrmed that the anti-miRNA effects of ASOs are closely associated with

Conclusions
Phosphorothioate (PS) linkages have been widely used to confer nuclease resistance to oligonucleotides.7 Since a PS linkage has a high affinity for protein, protein-binding greatly affects the intracellular function or distribution of PS-modied ASOs (PSASOs).10-12 Additionally, unfavorable protein-binding with PSASOs sometimes causes toxicological effects.22,47 In contrast, oligonucleotides with wild-type phosphodiester (PO) linkages have minimal interaction with proteins, but single-stranded POASOs are susceptible to nuclease digestion. Previously, we demonstrated that connecting the antisense sequence with a CD could overcome PO-ASOs instability.35
In this study, we examined the intracellular distributions of CD-connected ASs with PO-linkages. Aer transfection into cells, all single-stranded ASs promptly moved into the nucleus, whereas the CD-connected ASs were suppressed from such translocation, increasing the amount of CD-connected AS in the cytoplasm. We believe that CD-connected ASs would be advantageous in vivo by targeting RNAs existing in the cytoplasm. Importantly, dangling ASs with a free hydroxyl 50-terminal were susceptible to degradation in the cytoplasm. The AS instability was compensated for by introducing a CD or 50-end chemical modications. We propose that the AS will be organized to form an extended structure by connecting with the CD due to the rigid structure of this and the high stacking effect on the neighboring strand.46 The resultant extended conformation may contribute to suppression of the transportation of the oligonucleotide to the nucleus. In contrast, a single-stranded AS has a exible and random-coil structure that enables its rapid translocation to the nucleus.
Various types of RNAs localize differently in cells. If ASOs can be delivered to intracellular sites specic for target RNAs, dose and side-effects such as the off-targeting of ASOs, can be signicantly reduced. This study reveals that a stable duplex has the potential to regulate the intracellular distribution of oligonucleotides. Therefore, the results obtained here can provide important insights into controlling the localization of oligonucleotides in cells.

Abstract Introduction: Endovascular aneurysm repair requires the precise deployment of the graft. In order to achieve accurate positioning, the anatomical and morphological characteristics of the aorta and its branches is mandatory. Software that perform three dimensional reformatting of multislice tomographic images, allow for the study of the whole aorto-iliac axis and the perpendicular visualization of the origin of the renal arteries. The correct length of the proximal neck can be evaluated and adequate graft fixation and sealing may be foreseen. A technique is presented, using an software, for the orthogonal correction of the position of the renal arteries in relation to the proximal neck, which may guide the radioscopic orientation intraoperatively. Methods: Within a multiplanar tomographic image reconstruction, virtual triangulation allows for the three dimensional orthogonal correction of the renal arteries' ostia position. The predetermined best angulations for visualization are annotated and used for the positioning of the surgical C-arm.

RBCCV 44205-1524
Results/Discussion: Some authors discuss that the anatomic position of the renal vessels seen on the tomographic scan can change during the surgical procedure. It is known that the renal arterys' angular positioning does not alter, even after insertion of stiff guidewires, introducers, and the endograft itself. Therefore, it is possible, using concepts of spacial geometry and orthogonal correction, to predict the ideal bidimensional intraoperative positioning of the radioscopy device in order to reproduce the optimized renal artery ostial projection, ensuring the best accuracy during endograft deployment.
Conclusion: As closer to the tomographic reproduction was the radioscopic correction, more careful is the visualization of the ostium of the renal artery, better is the exploitation of the lap for fixing and sealing and the endoprosthesis deployment is more accurate.

Resumo Introdução: Para o preparo pré-operatório endovascular dos aneurismas infrarrenais é necessária a mensuração acurada de suas características anatômicas e morfológicas, alcançada com o uso de softwares avançados em manipulação de imagens de tomografias multicanais. Este processo permite também o estudo acurado das relações anatômicas das demais artérias do eixo aorto-ilíaco. Uma visualização perpendicular à origem da artéria renal mais baixa possibilita o uso de toda a extensão do colo para fixação da endoprótese e selamento proximal, o que pode ser previsto durante o estudo da tomografia, impedindo um posicionamento subótimo e a sobreposição das estruturas vasculares no intraoperatório. Expõem-se aqui os resultados iniciais de um projeto piloto, envolvendo manipulação de imagens tomográficas, na correção ortogonal da artéria renal aplicada à orientação radioscópica no intraoperatório.

Métodos: Por meio de reconstrução multiplanar de imagens tomográficas em software obtém-se um corte axial em ângulo reto. Conceitos geométricos de triangulação virtual promovem a correção ortogonal em três dimensões da visualização ostial da artéria renal, que pode ser reproduzida intraoperatoriamente, através do reposicionamento do arco cirúrgico.
Resultados/Discussão: Embora alguns autores argumentem que a anatomia do vaso observada na tomografia possa mudar durante o intraoperatório, sabe-se que o posicionamento angular das artérias renais não se modifica, mesmo após a inserção dos fios guia rígidos, introdutores e da própria endoprótese. Assim, acreditamos ser possível, por meio de conceitos de geometria espacial e correção ortogonal (por meio da manipulação das imagens em software), predizer o posicionamento ideal do aparelho de radioscopia de maneira a reproduzir o mesmo ângulo de projeção ostial da artéria renal em imagem bidimensional intraoperatória (angiografia), assegurando maior precisão na liberação da endoprótese.
Conclusão: Quanto mais próxima da reprodução tomográfica for essa correção radioscópica, mais cuidadosa é a visualização do óstio da artéria renal, melhor é o aproveitamento do colo para a fixação e selamento e mais precisa é a liberação da endoprótese.

INTRODUCTION
It is known that for the preoperative preparation of endovascular infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) accurate measurement of morphological and anatomical characteristics of the aneurysm is required, such as diameters, lengths and angles, essential strategy for their exclusion, the final result endovascular procedure [1].
With the enhancement of information technology, the study of helical biplane CT scans associated with complementary marked catheter aortography was replaced by the use of computed tomography (CT) multichannel (multislice), with cuts in smaller thicknesses and with greater detail that, when associated with three dimensions (3D) reconstruction software, allow the scanned virtual reproduction of the patient and his anatomy [2].
CT and angiography (angioTC) have an essential role in preinterventional planning and control of the procedure and is considered the test of choice in assessing the candidate patient to envodascular treatment and for his monitoring in search of complications [3].
These reconstructions allow rapid assessment of the extent of the aneurysm, visceral involvement, presence of angulation, tortuosity and access difficult. An accurate analysis of the axial, coronal and sagittal sections enables the plan-

ning of the type of stent to be used. This is achieved with the use of reconstruction methods available in software such as multiplanar reconstruction (MPR and MPR - Curved), maximum intensity projection (MIP) and 3D image reconstruction volume.
At this stage, performed in the preoperative period, we obtain the necessary information for surgical planning. Thus, it is possible the acquisition of final images that offer not only better accuracy of measurements and morphological features of the aneurysm as well as the study of their anatomical relationship with the other arteries of the aortoiliac axis [1].
An important aspect of planning is determining the best intraoperative placement of fluoroscopy, with a perfectly perpendicular view to the origin of the lowest renal artery visualization. A suboptimal positioning can cause overlapping of vascular structures, preventing the use of the entire length of the colon to the fixation of the stent graft and proximal sealing [4].
The initial results of a pilot project are set herein, performed by examining the feasibility of manipulation of CT images in software, the visualization and determination of radioscopic angulation of the aneurysm neck, through the use of a new technique. It is believed that this technique is quite simple, of immediate practical significance and can be easily incorporated into routine planning of endovascular treatment

with stents. So far, we have collected a series of cases of about 14 studies with encouraging results. For purposes of illustration of the technique used, the steps developed in one case in our series are following described.
METHODS
Multichannel CT scans of patients undergoing endovascular repair of infrarenal AAA at the Center for Highly Complex Endovascular Surgery, State University of Campinas, from August to December 2013 were assessed.
We used three-dimensional multiplanar reconstruction through DICOM - Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine image manipulation software (OsiriX MD), in analysis of aneurysms in serial CT images with fine cuts of 1 to 3mm, through intravenous iodinated contrast in the arterial phase.
We chose the lowest renal artery as a reference for the treatment of images because the proximal colon constituted its thread until the start of the AAA [5]. The aim was to achieve a perfectly perpendicular image to its source, or that is, its ostial projection, to correct anteroposterior angulation inherent to its morphology and any rotational effects caused by tortuosity of AAA. For this, a linear axis of the aorta (at the level of the emergence of the lowest renal artery) cut was achieved in axial image, provided by the right-angle correction of the sagittal and coronal MPR projections (Figure 1).
Upon analysis of the axial image, we then proceeded to construct a circumscribed equilateral triangle. Was traced a centerline axis of the aorta and parallel to the tangent of the arterial wall in the renal ostium where a first mark made in the anterior wall of the aorta was performed (Figs. 2A and 2B). This vertex is assumed to be the apex of the pyr-

amid at the beginning of the construction of the triangle. Therefore, we reproduced two additional marks guided by the height of the triangle placed subsequently in order to form an equilateral triangle (Figure 2C). To calculate the markup, we used the concepts of geometric construction, where the height (h) of an equilateral triangle in a circle corresponds to ¾ diameter, or 1 ½ time the radius of the circle [6] (r) (Figure 2D).
Starting with the geometric concept that three points are always coplanar, we proceeded to the three-dimensional reconstruction of CT. By means of rotational manipulation of the image if the three aligned points along a single axis, equidistant (Figure 3). The projection angles of the image display were provided automatically by the software (highlighted).
The images and angles achieved during the 3D reconstruction software were reproduced during surgery - with correction of angular positioning of the fluoroscopy unit - and were considered equivalent (Figures 4A , B and C).
We can also mention that for prostheses that have above two radiopaque markers at the same level at the proximal portion, it could be observed after the release of the stent, a placement in a straight position to these markings [ 4 ] which reinforces the idea of perpendicular view of the cervix (Figure 4D).
DISCUSSION
Early in the last decade, the study of helical CT combined with complementary biplanar aortography with marked catheters was recommended to all candidates for endovascular repair of AAA, by presenting themselves as complementary examinations values: while the first provided very accurate information about the diameters, the last allowed an accurate assessment of the length [7].

The viewing angles to be used in the correction of intraoperative fluoroscopy were provided by the software itself (below right, highlighted - in this case, craniocaudal 13,6o and left-anterior-oblique - 30,6o). The values used for surgical arch are approximate

Due to the high technological development of the CT since the introduction of helical acquisition to multichannel detectors equipment with efficient systems of transmission, processing and storage of data - it was possible to reduce the time of image acquisition and the development of more sensitive and accurate algorithms, with better performance and spatial resolution [2] reconstruction.
Currently, through angioTC the morphometry is performed, based on the assessment of the configuration, lengths and diameters of the aorta and iliac arteries and related to the lesion of interest as to the technique of performing the endovascular procedure. It allows even assess relevant anatomical variations when choosing the stent and the related surgical technique [2].
However, the intraoperative assessment of the release of the stent is usually guided by angiography, which provides two dimensional image. Therefore, it is known that the proximal neck of AAA and/or too angulated iliac arteries may hinder accurate visualization of the ostium of the renal artery.

The ideal positioning of the fluoroscopy unit during the surgical procedure may be different than expected during the preoperative study, in that the aneurysm possibly shorten or lengthen higher than expected [4]. Thus, some authors argue that the anatomy of the vessel can change due to the insertion of rigid guidewires, introducers and the delivery system itself. They believe that the image of the preoperative CT may be different from intraoperative angiography [6].
Van Keulen et. al. [4] discuss about the necessity of determining the intraoperative disposition of surgical arch arguing that a suboptimal positioning would lead the surgeon to underestimate the total length of the aneurysm neck and not using in its entirety for release and fixation of the endoprosthesis. This interpretation could be caused by an apparent overlap of vascular structures in the conventional biplane angiographic image. They recommend that the ideal angulation and positioning are determined taking into account the anteroposterior angulation of the neck and the clockwise orientation of the renal arteries. They also report that although the angulation of the neck of the aneurysm can be changed, the angular position of the renal arteries is not changed even under the influence of the inserted guide wire or the stent itself [4,8].
Our aim was to simplify this calculation, with simultaneous attainment of oblique and craniocaudais angles using concepts of three-dimensional geometry and spatial triangulation with the aid of software. That said, although the results are result from a pilot project underway, these proved to be very encouraging.
Therefore, we believe that it is possible, by means of concepts of geometric correction and through manipulation of DICOM images in software, to trace the same angle of ostial projection of the renal artery on intraoperative two-dimensional image (angiography).
When playing a tomographic cross section at right angles (or that is, perpendicular to the axis of the aorta), with rotation and orthogonal exposure of the renal artery, it is possible to predict the need for intraoperative correction of the fluoroscopy projection in obtaining two-dimensional angiographic image.
Utilizing the application of concepts of spatial geometry to achieve the best angle of ostial exposure of the renal artery systematically, it may reduce the variations between study observers and allows the reproducibility of the technique, reducing errors of interpersonal interpretation.
The closer this radioscopic correction of the tomographic reproduction, the more careful the visualization of the ostium of the renal artery, and the better the exploitation of the neck for fastening and sealing and the more accurate the endoprosthesis deployment.

INTRODUCTION

EPIDEMIOLOGY

The landscape of chronic liver disease in Egypt has drastically changed over the past few decades, with the decreasing prevalence of viral hepatitis and increasing prevalence of metabolicassociated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) (formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]). MAFLD has risen in prevalence to alarming levels, placing an enormous burden on individuals and healthcare systems. Despite the magnitude of the problem, no regional guidelines have been developed to tackle this disease.
This document provides the clinical practice guidelines of the key Egyptian opinion leaders on MAFLD screening, diagnosis, and management. The participants performed a detailed systematic review of the literature retrieved after an extensive PubMed search up to March 2021 on particular domains of interest, and deciphered the current scientific evidence into simple practice guidelines with recommendations to improve the routine clinical practice on patients with MAFLD.
These guidelines cover various aspects in the management of MAFLD, including epidemiology, screening, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment. The statements in this guideline are according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.[1] In case of disagreement, the final grading of evidence and recommendations was determined by a majority vote.
The document considers our local situations and the burden of clinical management for the healthcare sector and is proposed for daily clinical practical use and to orchestrate it with the advancing knowledge and research of MAFLD. Particular reference to special groups was done whenever necessary. The ultimate goal is to improve awareness of MAFLD and patient care, encourage dialogue between various stakeholders for the development of health policies, and assist in the decisionmaking process by providing evidencebased data. In addition, we identified some areas of gap in our knowledge and set an agenda for calling for research studies in our Egyptian population. As it is expected that new evidence will emerge from Egyptian cohorts, updates to these guidelines might be required in the future.

Over the past five decades, the nutrition pattern of the Egyptian population has witnessed an overall increase in energy intake. Nutrition moved to a type of diet with increases in the intake of fast food, red meat, vegetable oils, processed foods, and soft drinks, and decrease in the intake of fresh fruits and vegetables.[2] It is estimated that up to 40% of the fat consumed by women in Egypt is saturated fat,[3] and the rates of the low intake (below five servings per day) of fresh fruit and vegetables in Egypt is up 80%. [4] In contrast, Egypt is on track to meet the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for the elimination of hepatitis C, with a dramatic decline in the number of hepatitis C virus (HCV) cases.[5,6] Therefore, the profile of liver disease in Egypt is witnessing a trajectory shift from one of communicable to noncommunicable diseases.[79]
Parallel to these changes, although the prevalence of overweight and obesity (a bodymass index (BMI) of 25 kg/ m²or greater) has risen globally between 1980 and 2013 in both men (from 28.8% to 36.9%) and women (from 29.8% to 38.0%); the largest increases in the rate of obesity worldwide were seen in Egypt.[10] Indeed, Egypt is among the top 10 countries with the highest levels of obesity worldwide; >71.2% of adult men were overweight and 26.4% were obese, and 79.4% of adult women were overweight and 48.4% were obese.[10] Worryingly, the prevalence rates of overweight and obesity among school children and adolescents were 31.5% and 12.7%, respectively, among boys less than 20 years, and 39.5% and 14.4%, respectively, among girls of the same age group.[11] Similarly, the average prevalence of insufficient physical activity in Egypt is 31.0%, which is higher than the global prevalence of 27.5%. This number was even higher in females (38.8%) than in males (23.2%).[10]
The prevalence of MAFLD has risen in parallel with the aforementioned changes, with direct clinical and economic burden. Although there is scant data on the magnitude of MAFLD in Egypt, available data suggest that Egypt has one of the highest prevalence of MAFLD, affecting more than onethird of the population, compared to a global prevalence of about 25%.[9,12,13] Specific studies suggest that the prevalence range of MAFLD in Egypt is approximately 47.5%, with 56.7% having fibrosis,[14] and it was present in

approximately 15.8% of children.[15] Another retrospective study of 2097 patients from large Egyptian tertiary care liver centers revealed that the leading cause of patient presentation is MAFLD (44.9%).[16]
Unfortunately, the awareness of patients and physicians in Egypt about the magnitude of the problem and its risks is not sufficient.[17,18] Therefore, it is not surprising that NAFLD is seriously underdiagnosed in realworld settings,[19,20] with most patients being diagnosed incidentally when cirrhosis has already developed.[21]
DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSIS OF MAFLD
According to the Middle East and North Africa consensus,[22] the Egyptian guidelines endorse the proposal of the international consensus panel for the redefinition of fatty liver disease[2325] The diagnosis of MAFLD is based on the presence of liver steatosis (detected by liver histology, imaging, or noninvasive biomarkers), together with the presence of at least one of three criteria, which include () overweight or obesity, () type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and () clinical evidence of metabolic dysfunction. An avalanche of evidence supports the superiority of the new definition compared to the old NAFLD definition.[2629] In addition, the simplicity of the criteria render it suitable for resourceconstrained settings[22,27,2932] [Figure 1].
NATURAL HISTORY OF MAFLD

of MAFLDrelated HCC globally, with an increase of 89.8% between 1990 and 2017.[35] Consistently, another study in Egypt showed that the annual proportions of MAFLDrelated HCC increased significantly from 4.3% in 2010 to 20.6% in 2020, whereas HCVrelated HCC declined from 94.8% to 76.7%.[36]
Compared to other liver diseases, a recent study showed that MAFLDrelated HCC had a significantly higher percentage of death within 1 year of diagnosis and had approximately 5 months shorter survival time than HCC related to viral hepatitis (HCV/hepatitis B virus [HBV]).[37] Notably, a 2018 metaanalysis demonstrated that noncirrhotic patients with MAFLD had up to 261% increased risk of HCC compared to all other etiologies of liver disease.[38]
Similarly, MAFLD was found to be the most rapidly growing indication for liver transplantation in multiple countries in the region[39]; for example, more than 63% of referred patients for liver transplantation in Kuwait in 2018-2019 had MAFLDrelated cirrhosis.[40] Though it would be expected that Egypt would have a similar trend, further studies are required to confirm this.
EXTRAHEPATIC MANIFESTATIONS OF MAFLD
MAFLD is a multisystem disease associated with a plethora of extrahepatic manifestations and comorbidities.[41]

Egypt had the highest global agestandardized death rate from cirrhosis in all the years from 1990 to 2017, which was 103.3 per 100,000, despite a 22.4% decrease from 1990.[33] This decrease is likely driven by the rapid decrease in the HCV death rate. The decline is expected to continue over the next 5 years. However, the actual burden of MAFLD in Egypt is not fully characterized. Alarming numbers are emerging. In 2017, 12.8% of deaths due to cirrhosis in Egypt were caused by MAFLD and 6.5% were caused by other causes, most likely from undiagnosed MAFLD.
In addition, the agestandardized prevalence rates of compensated and decompensated cirrhosis due to MAFLD per 100,000 increased from 312.3 and 19.4 in 1990 to 340 and 26 in 2017, respectively. Furthermore, the proportion of causes for disabilityadjusted life years, a timebased measure that combines years of life lost due to premature mortality caused by MAFLDrelated cirrhosis, in 2017 was 12%.[33]

MAFLD is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD)[41] and chronic kidney disease (CKD)[42] risk. In addition to liver cancer, MAFLD is implicated in the risk of various extrahepatic cancers.[43] CVD and malignancy represent the main causes of death in MAFLD patients,[44] while baseline liver fibrosis is the strongest predictor.[45,46] Therefore, physicians treating patients with MAFLD should be encouraged to evaluate and undertake risk factor and comorbidities management as part of a holistic approach to patient care.
CVD risk can be assessed using risk scores (e.g., atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk estimator). MAFLD patients with a history of a cardiovascular event or presenting with clinically active CVD or evidence of metabolic comorbidities and/or severe liver disease, should be referred for evaluation by a cardiologist for further evaluation. Otherwise, patients who are negative or assessed as having low CVD risk can be reevaluated every 2-3 years.[47]

MAFLD is currently progressively increasing as the main cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) globally.[34] The available data suggest that Egypt has one of the highest increases in the agestandardized incidence rate

The types and choice of medications for treatment of T2DM, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are beyond the scope of these recommendations and should be followed according to the specific disease guidelines.

Noninvasive modalities that could be used in clinical practice are needed for diagnosis of MAFLD, assessing disease severity, and monitoring disease progression and treatment response.[48]
In routine clinical practice, abdominal ultrasonography is commonly used and is usually sufficient for the detection of hepatic steatosis.[49] However, it has poor sensitivity for detecting mild levels of steatosis.
The controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is more sensitive than ultrasonography and is being increasingly utilized to assess liver fat and can be obtained simultaneously with a liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by vibrationcontrolled transient elastography (VCTE) (FibroScan).[50] The optimal cutoff for identifying fatty liver by CAP was suggested by an earlier metaanalysis, to be 248 dB/m.[50] However, subsequent studies suggested higher optimal cutoff points, 288 dB/M[51] and 302 dB/M.[51] Further studies in Egyptian population are required. In addition, an interquartile range of >30-40 dB/m has been suggested to be associated with less reliable CAP measurements.[51,52] Probe selection also influences CAP values, and optimal cut points for the diagnosis of fatty liver are lower using the M probe versus the XL probe.[53]

indeterminant results or high scores are to be referred to specialists for further evaluation to appropriately guide the management of patients.
Proprietary biomarkers of fibrosis include Nterminal type III collagen propeptide (ProC3). A ProC3 based algorithm, the ADAPT algorithm, that includes age, T2DM, and platelet count has shown high diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis in tertiary hospitals[62] and general lowrisk populations cohorts.[63]
Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) obtained through VCTE, which is commercially available as FibroScan, is increasingly used in Egypt. An M probe and XL probe are both available. The majority of MAFLD patients can achieve successful measurement with the XL probe.[64,65] The quality criteria to guide its use are a minimum of 10 measurements, of which more than 60% should be valid, and the ratio of the median valid LSM to IQR should not exceed 0.3. Magnetic resonance elastography has higher accuracy and success rates compared to VCTE, but its wider use is limited by availability and cost.[66,67] The combination of LSM and simple fibrosis scores has the advantage of increasing accuracy and decreasing the percentage of patients classified as a gray zone. In contrast, there has not been any robust biomarker for steatohepatitis.
Recommendations

MRIbased techniques such as MRIPDFF and protonmagnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRIMRS) can detect small amounts of liver fat and is considered the gold standard to quantify liver fat. Currently, the main indication for liver fat fraction measurement by MRI is for clinical trials.[54]
Numerous steatosis simple scores have been proposed as an alternative method for the assessment of hepatic steatosis, particularly in largepopulation studies. In particular, the FLI, which includes BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, and GGT, is widely used[55] and has been recently validated in a large cohort of 35,335 patients with MAFLD.[56]
Simple fibrosis scores only involve clinical and routine laboratory parameters, are widely validated and reproducible scores, and are inexpensive; these include the aspartate aminotransferase (AST)toplatelet ratio index (APRI),[57] Fibrosis4 index (FIB4),[58] and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS).[59] Patients can be defined as being at low or high risk for advanced fibrosis for each score according to the following cutoffs: APRI (0.5 and 1.5), FIB4 (1.30 and 2.67), NFS (<-1.455 and > 0.67611). These cutoffs need to be further validated in Egyptian cohorts. These scores are well suited for use as an initial assessment in primarycare or resourcepoor settings.[60,61] Subjects with

· Noninvasive modalities that could be used in clinical practice are needed for diagnosis of MAFLD, assessing disease severity, and monitoring disease progression and treatment response (A1).
· Abdominal ultrasonography is the recommended firstline tool for the detection of hepatic steatosis (A1).
· Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurement is a more sensitive tool than ultrasonography. Thus, if available, it can be used for both diagnosis and disease monitoring (B1).
· Although considered the gold standard to quantify liver fat, MRIbased techniques are not recommended for routine clinical practice (A1).
· The exclusion of high risk of significant fibrosis is acceptable using simple noninvasive biomarkers and scores of fibrosis (A2).
· The confirmation of significant fibrosis can be done by liver stiffness measurement by VCTE and/or sequential combination with serum biomarkers/scores (A2).
· As per the clinical judgment, liver biopsy could be required in some cases, particularly in patients with indeterminant (gray) range scores (B2).
· There is no strong biomarker for steatohepatitis, and liver biopsy remains the only diagnostic test of choice (A1).

LIVER BIOPSY
With the high prevalence of MAFLD, biopsy evaluation is indicated mainly to confirm the diagnosis when the clinical picture is atypical, to aid in the assessment of prognosis when some cases fall into the gray zone,[68] to identify additional causes of liver disease, and to determine if a patient might benefit from an intervention.
The use of a 16G or wider needle via a percutaneous approach under ultrasound guidance is recommended for the biopsy. An adequate histology specimen should comprise at least 10 portal tracts and be 2 cm or more long. Liver biopsy is limited by a) sampling error, b) interobserver variability, and c) the potentially rare complications.[69] There are at least three common systems to evaluate MAFLD biopsies, namely Brunt score,[70] the NAFLD activity score (NAS),[71] and the fatty liver inhibition of progression (FLIP) algorithm and the steatosis, activity, and fibrosis (SAF) scoring system. Emerging evidence suggests that the SAF score provides a more robust histological assessment.[72]
Recommendations:
· Indications for liver biopsy in patients with MAFLD (A1) · A typical feature of noninvasive tests is sowing indeterminate or unreliable results. · Assessment for dualetiology liver diseases. · Ethically approved research or clinical trials, including during bariatric surgery or cholecystectomy.
· Liver biopsy reporting should be standardized using either the FLIP algorithm and SAF score or the NASH CRN system (B1).
MAFLDRELATED CIRRHOSIS

steatosis by hepatic imaging should be considered as having MAFLDrelated cirrhosis, even in the absence of hepatic steatosis or typical histology of MAFLD at the time of presentation.[24]
Cirrhosis can be diagnosed by classic findings on ultrasonography, but the diagnosis may be missed when this is obscured by liver fat. In this context, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) can be used to diagnose cirrhosis and provide prognostic information in MAFLD patients in the appropriate clinical context,[76] with mortality rate being higher with increasing LSM.[77] If LSM is not available, fibrosis scores can be used as an initial step to rule out patients who are less likely to have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and determine patients who need referral for LSM.[68]
Aside from the prevention and treatment of decompensation events, cirrhosis management should focus on education, lifestyle modification, protecting the liver from further injury (e.g., through vaccination for viral hepatitis and avoidance of hepatotoxic medications), and care coordination;[78] moreover, it remains critical to avoid sarcopenia [Figure 2].
Recommendations
· Patients with cirrhosis in the absence of current steatosis who meet the following criteria should still be considered as having MAFLDrelated cirrhosis: · Past or present evidence of meeting the criteria to diagnose MAFLD, with at least one of the following:
1) Historical documentation of MAFLD on a previous liver biopsy*.
2) Historical documentation of hepatic steatosis by imaging*. (B2)
*History of past viral hepatitis should be considered as patients may have dual disease etiology.

The highest risk of hepatic complication is among those with cirrhosis and of nonhepatic complication is among patients with stage 3 fibrosis.[46,73] Classification of cirrhosis depends on prognostic staging--compensated and decompensated cirrhosis[74,75]--based on the presence or absence of clinically evident decompensating events such as jaundice, variceal hemorrhage, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or encephalopathy.
Patients with cirrhosis and past or present evidence of metabolic dysfunction that meet the criteria to diagnose MAFLD with either documentation of MAFLD on a previous liver biopsy or historical documentation of

DIAGNOSIS AND MONITORING FOR CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT PORTAL HYPERTENSION AND VARICES
The initial consequence of liver cirrhosis in general, or MAFLDrelated cirrhosis in particular, is portal hypertension.[79] The goldstandard for assessment of clinically significant portal hypertension is the direct measurement of HVPG, as this is invasive and not readily available. Alternatively, ultrasound is a feasible and safe technique for detecting morphological abnormalities associated with cirrhosis and an indicative measure of clinically significant portal hypertension. Computed tomography (CT) and MRI are other alternative tools.[80]

Figure 2: The Egyptian guidelines recommended an algorithm to evaluate and manage patients with MAFLDrelated compensated and decompensated cirrhosis.

Patients with MAFLDrelated cirrhosis should be screened for gastroesophageal varices according to the Baveno VI criteria, as the prognosis is worse in those with gastroesophageal varices compared to those without.[81,82] The Baveno VI criteria have been recently validated in patients with MAFLD related cirrhosis.[83]
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is required to confirm the existence and size of varices, though it is an invasive procedure with a risk of bleeding.[84] The assessment of LSM is an alternative accepted technique to rule out highrisk varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis. The interpretation of LSM data is as follows: LSM >15 kPa can diagnose cirrhosis, LSM = 10-15 kPa is suggestive of cirrhosis, and LSM <10 kPa in the absence of other clinical signs rules out cirrhosis.[85,86] Patients with LSM >15 kPa should be considered for surveillance for HCC, whereas those with LSM >20-25 kPa and/or thrombocytopenia, the use of EGD may be recommended for confirmation of diagnosis and prophylactic interventions in these patients.[85]

Recommendations
· Screening by EGD for gastroesophageal varices is recommended in patients with MAFLDassociated cirrhosis unless previously diagnosed and treated (B2).
· The exact interval of screening by EGD in patients without gastroesophageal varices is unclear. However, in patients with multiple etiologies and/ or those for whom the state of decompensation continues, screening EGD should be repeated every year. For the rest of the patients, screening intervals can be extended up to 2 years (C2).
· Relying on noninvasive tests to diagnose gastroesophageal varices is not recommended due to the low diagnostic accuracy (A1).
· Ultrasound is recommended for detecting cirrhosis. Liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography can be used to exclude highrisk varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis (B2).

SCREENING FOR HCC IN PATIENTS WITH MAFLD
Abdominal ultrasound is the preferred screening tool for HCC due to its availability and costeffectiveness.[31,87,88] However, it has low sensitivity for detection of earlystage HCC (~47%);[89] therefore, simultaneous measurement of serum biomarker such as AFP is recommended.[89,90] Despite their high diagnostic efficacy, using dynamic imaging such as contrastenhanced ultrasonography, computed tomography, and MRI for screening for HCC is not recommended as a surveillance modality due to the lack of wide availability and high cost, except for patients in whom the ultrasound quality is suboptimal due to obesity or excessive gas in the alimentary tract or when confirmation is required.[91]
A 6month screening interval is recommended, which is based on the tumor volume doublingtime of HCC.[92] A randomized controlled trial demonstrated the detection rate of early HCC and prognosis does not differ significantly with 3 or 6monthly surveillance intervals; 6monthly surveillance interval has been found to be better than a 12month interval.[93]
The targeted population for screening are MAFLD patients with cirrhosis. Although noncirrhotic patients with MAFLD are at high risk of HCC,[94] the overall risk in the absence of cirrhosis is relatively low to justify the recommendation of screening in this group of patients, particularly with the very high prevalence of MAFLD.
Recommendations
· Screening for HCC in MAFLD patients with cirrhosis through a combination of abdominal ultrasound and alphafetoprotein (AFP) every 6 months is recommended, as it improves overall survival; however, it is not recommended in noncirrhotic patients due to lack of evidence for costeffectiveness (A1).
· Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed if the ultrasound quality is inadequate (B2).
NONPHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT OF MAFLD
Lifestyle modifications, including dietary change, weight loss, and exercise intervention, remain the cornerstone therapy and the firstline for this disease.

Diet and Lifestyle Changes In patients with MAFLD, lifestyle intervention programs and weight loss effectively lead to a reduction in hepatic steatosis, resolution of steatohepatitis, and regression of fibrosis, and improve a patient's quality of life in a dosedependent manner.
The overall aim of lifestyle intervention should be for gradual weight loss (up to 1 kg/week) with losing 7%-10% of their body weight in obese patients and 5% in nonobese subjects as a primary target. There is no robust evidence to support a particular dietary approach for patients with MAFLD. Generally, a hypocaloric diet (500-1000kcal deficit), with a daily protein intake of 1.2-1.5 g/kg of body weight/day is recommended. Notably, excess caloric restriction should be avoided as it can exacerbate the risk of sarcopenia, which is a poor predictor outcome in obese cirrhotic patients. Dietary plans should discourage the consumption of fructose and encourage adopting the "Mediterranean type diet"[95] and regular coffee drinking.[96]
In real life, weight loss and more critically sustaining this effect is challenging. Using the 5 A's model (ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange) may be useful to assess patients' needs and modify their behavior. Increasing clinic visit frequency[97] and/or utilizing an internetbased approach for lifestyle changes[98] have been proposed to maximize the efficacy of weight loss programs in patients with MAFLD.
Recent evidence suggests that alcohol use is associated with hepatic steatosis even in subjects with presumed NAFLD, according to current definitions.[99] In addition, alcohol intake within the limits of the current definition has been reported to increase significantly the risk for progression of fatty liver disease[23,100,101] and increased risk of HCC.[102,103]
Exercise Regular physical activity and exercise have been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on the entire spectrum of MAFLD, including improvements in hepatic steatosis and healthrelated quality of life[104] and reduction in liver stiffness, portal hypertension,[105] and risk of HCC.[106]
There is no defined optimal frequency, intensity, duration, and type of physical activity/exercise for the induction of resolution of MAFLD. For the general adult population, physical activity guidelines recommend a total of 150 min/week of moderateintensity exercise or 30 min/day for 5 days/week, or vigorousintensity exercise for 75 min/week or 20 min/day on 3 days/ week. Resistance exercise on 2-3 days/week and flexibility exercises >2 days/week are also recommended.[107]

Saudi Journal of Gastroenterology | Volume 28 | Issue 1 | January-February 2022

Fouad, et al.: Egyptian MAFLD guidelines

A recent randomized clinical trial demonstrated that both vigorous and moderate exercise and aerobic and resistance exercise reduces hepatic steatosis equally in MAFLD, and the effect appeared to be largely mediated by weight loss.[108,109] Thus, generally, the selection of the type and duration of exercise should be tailored according to patients' preference and the likelihood of compliance. Resistance and moderate exercise may be more feasible than aerobic and vigorous exercise for MAFLD patients with poor fitness. Combined diet/exercise strategies containing a minimum 6 months of highintensity lifestyle intervention followed by 1 year of a maintenance program are recommended.
Recommendations
· Lifestyle changes, including combined healthy diet and exercise strategies are effective in normalization of liver enzymes levels and improvement of liver histology. (B1)
· Weight loss is beneficial and recommended in patients with MAFLD, regardless of BMI. 7-10% and 5% weight loss is the target in the overweight/ obese and nonobese patients with MAFLD, respectively. (B1)
· Physical activity without any pharmacotherapy is enough for MAFLD patients without steatohepatitis or fibrosis (B1)
· There is no particular mandatory dietary approach, and dietary counseling should be individualized. Generally, energy restriction, Mediterraneantype diet, regular coffee drinking, and avoiding processed food and fructose are advisable. (B1)
· Both vigorous and moderate exercise and aerobic exercise and resistance training reduce hepatic steatosis equally in MAFLD, though resistance exercise may be more feasible for patients with poor fitness. Recommendations should be individualized based on patient preferences to enhance longterm adherence. (B2)
BARIATRIC AND METABOLIC THERAPIES (ENDOSCOPIC APPROACHES AND SURGERY) FOR MAFLD
Though not an indication per se, MAFLD exists in 65%-90% of all patients who undertake weight loss surgery.[110,111] Multiple retrospective and prospective observational cohort studies from Egypt[112,113] showed consistent results with international findings, with metaanalyses[114116] suggesting that resolution of hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis was observed in >75% of patients.[117]

Special precautions are required when bariatric surgery is considered in patients with MAFLDrelated cirrhosis due to the high perioperative risk with a suggested operative mortality of up to 16.3% in those with decompensated disease.[118] Notably, in a recent Egyptian study of 132 cases with ChildA MAFLDrelated cirrhosis, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) was found to be safe and led to improvement of steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis, after 30month followup.[119]
The utility of endoscopic bariatric and metabolic therapies (EBMT), including intragastric balloons (IGBs) and endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), as less invasive and safer interventions compared to the traditional operations are emerging and may represent an attractive option for patients with MAFLD.[120]
Therefore, based on the current evidence, bariatric surgery can be offered to patients with MAFLD only if the following two criteria are met: 1) BMI >40 kg/m2 or BMI >35 kg/m2 with obesityrelated comorbidities; 2) absence of decompensated cirrhosis or evidence of concomitant portal hypertension. The utility and feasibility of bariatric surgery for patients with MAFLD and BMI 35 kg/m2 is currently unclear, and further studies are required to clarify this aspect.
Recommendations
· Bariatric surgery can be offered to patients with MAFLD only if the following two criteria are met: 1) BMI >40 kg/m2 or BMI >35 kg/m2 with obesityrelated comorbidities; 2) absence of decompensated cirrhosis or evidence of concomitant portal hypertension. (B1)
· The utility and feasibility of bariatric surgery for patients with MAFLD and BMI 35 kg/m2 is currently unclear. (C2)
· Bariatric (metabolic) surgery improves all MAFLD parameters, including reduction of liver fat, resolution of steatohepatitis, and regression of fibrosis. (B1)
· The decision for offering bariatric (metabolic) surgery for patients with cirrhosis should be individualized because of the high risk of postoperative complications. (C1)
PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT
Due to the shared pathogenic pathways between MAFLD

and T2DM, several antidiabetic medications have been investigated for the treatment of patients with MAFLD.[121,122] The beneficial effects of pioglitazone on hepatic histology in patients with and without T2DM has been reported in five smallrandomized controlled trials.[123127] However, due to multiple possible concerns with pioglitazone, including weight gain, edema, the development of bladder cancer, and a decrease in bone mineral density, this therapy is not widely used.[128,129] Metformin does not improve hepatic histology in patients with MAFLD.[130133] However, it improves insulin resistance[130,132,133] and reduces the risk of HCC in these patients, though it should be noted that the studies have not been randomized or prospective.[134,135]
Though some studies have shown that vitamin E can have some role in improving hepatic histology in patients with steatohepatitis,[123,136138] other studies failed to confirm these findings.[127,132,139,140] A recent study demonstrated that vitamin E decreases the risk of hepatic decompensation, transplant, and death in MAFLD patients with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis.[141] The development of prostate cancer and hemorrhagic stroke is a possible concern of vitamin E therapy.[142]

· Pioglitazone improves histological markers of MAFLD; however, there are some concerns about safety. (B2)
· Metformin has no effect on hepatic histology but improves insulin resistance and may reduce the risk of HCC. (B2)

Although statins did not show beneficial effects on hepatic histology,[143] they may reduce cardiovascular morbidity in patients with MAFLD.[143,144] Thus, statins can be used safely in patients with MAFLD with hyperlipidemia.
Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a firstinclass selective farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist and represents the most advanced drug in development to date; however, it is not approved yet.[145] In terms of adverse events, the main adverse event of OCA was pruritus, which occurred in half of patients that received 25mg daily. Another major caveat of OCA is the elevation in serum lowdensity lipid protein (LDL) and decrease in highdensity lipid protein (HDL). Thus, statins should be considered in patients with MAFLD with hyperlipidemia or who receive OCA therapy.[145]
There are many pharmacological agents under clinical trials in phase II and phase III development [Table 1] and beyond the scope of discussion in this guideline document.
Recommendations
· Statins reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and can be used in patients who receive obeticholic acid, if needed. (B1)
· Vitamin E may improve histological markers of disease activity; however, there are some concerns about safety. (B2)

MONTORNG PROGRESS AND RESPONSE TO TREATMENT
Given that the severity of fibrosis is the major determinant of both hepaticrelated outcomes and mortality,[146] those with significant fibrosis need the closest monitoring and the following scheme is recommended and can mainly be undertaken at primary care for the stage with no or early fibrosis and using simple noninvasive scores of fibrosis:
Interval of followup 1) Patients without fibrosis can be monitored at 2 or
3year intervals if they do not have concomitant metabolic risk factors or if there has been no worsening of these comorbidities. 2) Patients with fibrosis or evidence uncontrolled concomitant metabolic risk factors should be monitored on an annual basis 3) Patients with cirrhosis should undergo monitoring at 6month intervals, including surveillance for HCC (please see the next section for details).
Method of followup With acknowledgment of the fact that there is no ideal biomarker of the score with a high predictive value for differentiating different stages of liver fibrosis, we recommend monitoring of fibrosis progression in the clinic by using noninvasive scores (NFS, FIB4) and ideally if possible in combination with liver stiffness measurement

12

Saudi Journal of Gastroenterology | Volume 28 | Issue 1 | January-February 2022

Fouad, et al.: Egyptian MAFLD guidelines

by transient elastography[147,148] to increase the accuracy of prediction and minimize the gray zone.
Recommendations
· Patients without fibrosis, concomitant metabolic risk factors, or the absence of worsening of metabolic risk factors can be monitored at intervals of 2 or 3 years. (C2)
· Patients with fibrosis or concomitant metabolic risk factors should be monitored on an annual basis by using a combination of noninvasive scores and/or liver stiffness measurement. (C2)
· Patients with cirrhosis should undergo monitoring at 6month intervals, including surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma. (A2)
PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES IN MAFLD
MAFLD was demonstrated to be associated with low healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL), independent of other demographics or metabolic comorbidities.[149,150] Instruments for assessing patient reported outcomes (PRO) include questionnaires that evaluate general HRQoL such as Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ), the Short Form-36 (SF-36), and EuroQoL 5Dimensions 5Level (EQ5D5L), or diseasespecific questionnaires such as NASHCHECK and CLDQNASH.[151153] Although these questionnaires have been translated into various languages and validated in various countries, these are yet to be well validated in Egypt, and how cultural variation may influence the PROs is not known.
Recommendations:
· Patients with MAFLD seem to have worse HRQoL, physical, fatigue, and mental scores, compared to patients with other causes of chronic liver disease. (B2)
· Integration of patient perspectives on the disease, quality of life, satisfaction, and compliance with lifestyle advice via patientreported outcomes (PRO) is crucial for developing a holistic patientcentered model of care for MAFLD. (B2)
SPECIAL GROUPS
Lean MAFLD Although overweight/obesity is classically associated with the development and progression of MAFLD, a

recent metaanalysis estimated that within the MAFLD population, 40.8% are non-obese and 19.2% are lean, without differences in the histological severity of disease between lean and obese patients.[154,155] Non-obese patients with MAFLD may have a worse outcome and accelerated disease progression.[156158] Insulin resistance and altered body fat distribution rather than BMI could be better indicators of MAFLD in such patients and hence the importance of the new diagnostic criteria of MAFLD.[154]
The management of nonobese subjects with MAFLD relies on lifestyle intervention through regular exercise and controlling metabolic comorbidities, irrespective of baseline BMI. A 3%-5% weight reduction may be sufficient in lean MAFLD. In addition, nonobese subjects were found to be more likely to maintain weight reduction and normal liver enzymes in the long term compared to obese subjects.[159]
Recommendations:
· MAFLD can frequently exist in nonobese subjects. (B1)
· Lifestyle intervention with regular exercise is effective in treating MAFLD and in improving overall fitness and metabolic comorbidities irrespective of baseline BMI. (B1)
Dual Etiologies As MAFLD is no longer a diagnosis of exclusion and it is now possible to diagnose its coexistence with other liver diseases such as HBV and HCV, meeting the criteria for a diagnosis of MAFLD plus one or more of the other diagnoses as the cause of chronic liver diseases at baseline or at followup, should be diagnosed as dual etiology liver disease.
These individuals are likely to have a different natural history and response to therapy than those with liver disease of a "single" etiology.[24] With the high prevalence rates of MAFLD and viral hepatitis in Egypt, it is expected that these disease entities will frequently occur together.
In this regard, a recent study of more than 10,000 consecutive patients with HCV from Egypt estimated that nearly half of these patients have coexisting MAFLD, and this group of patients were at a higher risk of hepatic fibrosis compared to those with HCV.[160]

Saudi Journal of Gastroenterology | Volume 28 | Issue 1 | January-February 2022

13

Fouad, et al.: Egyptian MAFLD guidelines

Recommendations
· Patients with liver diseases such as ALD and viral hepatitis should be carefully evaluated for possible concurrent MAFLD and vice versa (A1).
· Patients with MAFLD should be advised to avoid alcohol or at least to consume the lowest amount possible (B1).
· MAFLD management and that of concomitant diseases should be as per the standard guidelines for each of the diseases (B1).
Cured HCV or Treated HBV Subjects MAFLD is emerging as a key cause for persistently abnormal liver tests, continuing to drive liver disease progression and offset the beneficial impact of profound virological suppression or sustained virological response and poor outcomes in individuals with chronic HBV and/or HCV infection on endstage liver disease, HCC burden, and dropout rate from the liver transplant waiting list.[161,162] Treatment of MAFLD in this group should be considered the same as that for noninfected patients. In addition, multiple studies have demonstrated that direct acting antiviralsinduced SVR is associated with weight gain, increased serum lipid levels, and hepatic steatosis.[163] Therefore, this group of patients may be more vulnerable to MAFLDrelated complications.
Recommendations
· Patients cured of HCV or having profound HBV virological suppression with MAFLD need monitoring because of the increased risk for progression to cirrhosis, development of HCC, as well as extrahepaticrelated complications. (B1)
· The exact monitoring schedule is yet to be defined, but these patients can be followed according to the recommendations of MAFLD single etiology. (B2)
· Deterioration of lipid profiles and increase in weight and hepatic steatosis are frequently overlooked post-SVR. Clinicians should actively find, monitor these parameters, and intervene as appropriate, to reduce cardiocerebral vascular disease risk. (B1)

the severity of hepatic steatosis and liver enzymes.[164] Another study showed a direct effect of Ramadan fasting on improving noninvasive measures of fibrosis as well as on inflammatory markers and insulin sensitivity.[165] In addition, both preclinical animal studies and human clinical trials have demonstrated that intermittent fasting has widespectrum benefits for many health conditions, including MAFLD.[166]
Recommendations
Ramadan fasting is advisable with plethoric beneficial effects in patients with MAFLD (A2).
MANAGEMENT OF MAFLDRELATED HCC
Metabolic risk factor modification could contribute to the optimum management of patients with MAFLDrelated HCC; physical activity has been found to have a positive impact on HCCrelated survival.[167] However, as sarcopenia is reported to be a prognostic factor for patients with HCC,[168175] careful consideration of body composition, including skeletal muscle mass and body fat, is crucial when recommending treating patients with HCC and particularly when recommending physical activity.
T2DM is a risk factor for HCC, and metformin has been demonstrated to significantly reduce the risk of HCC in MAFLD patients with HbA1c levels of >7.0%[134] and extend the survival of HCC patients with T2DM after the curative treatment of HCC.[135] Thus, in MAFLDrelated HCC patients with T2DM, metformin with lifestyle intervention may be recommended. However, further prospective, wellcontrolled randomized studies including Egyptian patients are required before any strong recommendation can be made.
Recommendations:
· Metformin and lifestyle intervention could be beneficial in MAFLDrelated HCC patients, particularly patients with T2DM. (B1)
· Careful consideration of sarcopenia as a prognostic factor and appropriate nutritional therapy is recommended. (C2)

RAMADAN FASTING
Restriction in mealconsuming timing has emerged as a potential promising dietary approach for the management of obesity and dysmetabolic diseases, including MAFLD. Ramadan fasting has been reported in a study from Egypt on 83 patients with MAFLD to lead to a reduction of

LIVER TRANSPLANTATION FOR MAFLD
MAFLD is emerging as the leading indication for liver transplantation (LT). The related comorbidities with MAFLD directly impact patient evaluation and selection, waitlist morbidity, mortality, and eventually posttransplant

14

Fouad, et al.: Egyptian MAFLD guidelines

outcomes. Although LT is a radical treatment for cirrhosis, it does not treat these underlying comorbidities; therefore, this population is maintained at an increased risk for CVD and postoperative morbidity after LT.[176] Thus, a careful cardiovascular evaluation is mandatory. Survival after MAFLDassociated liver transplant has been reported to be similar to those for other causes of liver disease.[177] On the contrary, the main causes of mortality in patients with MAFLD following LT are sepsis and cardiovascular disease.[178]
The increasing prevalence of MAFLD in the general population corresponds directly with the increasing prevalence of MAFLD in both the deceased and living donor pools. The use of steatotic livers has been associated with an increased risk of graft failure and/or impaired graft function.[179]
The optimal regime in MAFLD recipients is unclear. Strategies to control associated comorbidities before LT should be prioritized to favorably impact waitlist mortality, decrease the rate of recurrent or de novo MAFLD after LT, and improve posttransplant outcome. In addition, immunosuppression including steroids and calcineurins inhibitors can cause or worsen modifiable risk factors and therefore should be minimized. Statins should be encouraged postLT in those with dyslipidemia and/or preexisting CVD and may be associated with a survival benefit.[180]

for the general population along with special populations with MAFLD. Fibrosis is the single major risk factor of all hepatic and extrahepatic complications of MAFLD, with numerous noninvasive tools for assessment of fibrosis available and increasingly used. Holistic multidisciplinary and patientcentered approaches are needed to provide optimal care for patients with MAFLD. These models should aim to tackle the entire spectrum of the disease that includes not only the resolution of hepatic steatosis and liver injury but also the amelioration of the associated systemic metabolic milieu and control the accompanied comorbidities that aggravate the risk of cardiovascular and other extrahepatic complications, with patientreported outcomes being at the core. Lifestyle intervention, including dietary changes and structured exercise, remains the holy grail of management, with an armamentarium of therapeutic options expected to be available over the next few years. In the extreme of the spectrum of the disease, bariatric (metabolic) surgery may be indicated. MAFLD patients with cirrhosis should be considered for surveillance for varices and HCC. Multiple gaps in our knowledge on MAFLD are identified, and a joint effort by various stakeholders for gathering more evidence is the only way forward for the full adoption of these recommendations and tackling this growing burden.
Research priorities and unmet needs in the field

Recommendations
· Liver transplantation should be considered in appropriately selected MAFLD patients with decompensated liver disease or HCC. (B1)
· Patients with MAFLD have a high risk of presence of preexisting CVD and hence should be thoroughly assessed prior to listing for transplantation and followed up afterwards.. (B1)
CONCLUSION
The burden of MAFLD is rapidly increasing in Egypt and is emerging as a leading cause of chronic liver disease, HCC, and liver transplantation. In addition, it is intimately associated with numerous systemic complications such as T2DM, CVD, CKD, and multiple cancers. In our region, dual etiology, particularly with viral hepatitis, is common and challenging. The Egyptian guideline document for MAFLD is aimed to provide simple and practical recommendations for the assessment and management

We recommend the following research priorities to improve MAFLD-related health outcomes in Egypt: · Serum tests and risk stratification algorithms for
staging MAFLD and validating the cut-offs of noninvasive scores of fibrosis in the Egyptian MAFLD population. · Studies to establish and test the efficacy of task shifting and referral pathways based on the MAFLD diagnostic criteria. · Identifying the characteristics of patients with dual disease (MAFLD and HCV; MAFLD and HBV). · Characterization of the genetic architecture of MAFLD in this region would be required. · Studies to compare the diagnostic accuracy, costeffectiveness, and patient outcomes reported using the NAFLD and MAFLD diagnostic criteria in Egyptian cohorts. · Relative to their proportion of the global MAFLD population, Egypt is underrepresented in ongoing clinical trials for pharmaceutical treatments. Thus, more clinical trials in Egyptian populations are necessary.

Abstract
Background: The list of complications reported after decompressive craniectomy (DC) and cranioplasty is progressively increasing. Nonetheless, the exact incidence of these events is still illdefined. Problems affecting skin flaps after DC and cranioplasty have never been accurately analyzed in papers and their impact on patients' prognosis is largely underestimated.
Methods: In a 10year time, we treated by DC 450 patients, 344 of whom underwent cranioplasty, either with autologous bone or artificial implants (hydroxyapatite, polyetheretherketone, titanium, polymethylmethacrylate). Complications involving skin flaps and requiring resurgery were observed and treated in 38 cases. We classified three main types of lesions: (1) dehiscence, (2) ulcer, and (3) necrosis. In all cases surgical decision making was performed in cooperation with plastic surgeons, to select the best treatment option.
Results: Dehiscence was reported in 28 cases, ulcer in 6, and necrosis in 4. Surgeries included flap reopening and resuturing, Zplasty, rotational, advancement, or free flaps. Treatment complications required further surgical procedures in six patients.
Conclusions: In our experience, complications involving skin flaps after DC and postDC cranioplasty cannot be considered a minor event because of their potential to further compromise the yet fragile conditions of these patients. Their management is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach to get the better results.

INTRODUCTION
In last years, some reports focused attention on complications occurring after decompressive craniectomy (DC) and postdecompressive cranioplasty.[3,4,7] The interest for this topic raises from the progressively increasing number of decompressive and reconstructive procedures performed by neurosurgeons in their daily practice, an increase related to the lack of an effective medical

treatment for "malignant" intracranial hypertension. Initially suggested for severe head trauma (HT), indications to DC have been extended to a larger spectrum of lesions, including brain ischemia, spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), malignant brain edema from intrinsic brain tumors, massive intratumoral bleeding, and meningoencephalitis.[1,8]
Despite completed and ongoing trials, until now the only certainty about DC relies on its capacity of restoring normal levels of intracranial pressure (ICP), which, according to detractors, seems to result in an enhanced survival with no improvement of prognosis. With the increasing experience, the list of complications affecting patients undergoing DC and postDC cranioplasty is growing up.[5] Either frequent adverse events (infection, hydrocephalus, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] leak, bone resorption, epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, and brain contusions) and rare ones (paradoxical brain herniation and sinking flap syndrome) have been reported.[2,4,6] Even though in most cases their etiopathogenesis is quite indisputable, some conditions are still far away from finding a plain explanation. This may be troublesome when considering that complications, especially those furtively occurring like hydrocephalus, play a crucial role in DC patients' prognosis, potentially leading to sudden clinical deterioration and death even in yet improving subjects. Finally, even the few available papers giving an esteem of the incidence of specific complications, do not give any clue about eventual strategies needed to minimize or prevent their occurrence.
Starting from the above considerations, the small interest for troubles affecting skin flaps overlying decompressed brains comes as no surprise. Neurosurgeons' expertise in this field may be considered, at least, "inadequate." Moreover, traditional beliefs, including the idea that when a cranioplasty gets exposed, it must absolutely be removed, should be rediscussed, in light of the large availability of powerful antibiotics, the improvement of surgical techniques and the introduction of preformed implants realized in resterilizable materials. Here, we present our 10year experience in this field, result of a continuous sidetoside collaboration with plastic surgeons. Relying on the complete lack of information which could be gathered from the literature, we tried to propose a scheme of classification of the observed lesions, aimed to select the best treatment options according to specific situations, to improve results and minimize patients' risks of further surgeries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In a 10year time, from January 2001 to December 2011, 450 DCs were performed at our institution for various etiologies. Two hundred and thirtyfive patients underwent decompression because of severe HT, 110 for ICH,

67 for SAH, 14 for hemorrhagic tumors, 11 for massive ischemic brain damage, 9 for meningoencephalitis, 4 for brain abscesses, 5 for bleeding inside arteriovenous malformations, and 5 for brain swelling in malignant brain tumors. Unilateral hemicraniectomy was performed in 362 patients, bifrontal craniectomy in 79, and bilateral hemicraniectomy in 9. Cranioplasty was performed in 344 patients. Autologous bone (AB) was repositioned in 307 cases; artificial implants were used in 37 cases because of AB unavailability (comminuted bone fracture, bone exposure, and bone infection). Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), titanium meshes, threedimensional modeled titanium, and polyetheretherketone (PEEK).
Medium time interval from craniectomy to cranioplasty was 67 days, the shortest time being 27 days, and the longest 158 days. Complications affecting skin flaps were recorded in 38 patients. Standard protocol in all cases included: a. Preoperative laboratory examinations: Complete
blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Creactive protein, and renal and liver function b. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan without and with contrast enhancement, to disclose the presence of subcutaneous, epidural, or intradural (subdural and intraparenchymal) purulent collections, ependymitis, signs of bone, or cranioplasty involvement after reconstruction (osteomyelitis, erosion, and contrast enhancement) c. 48 h postoperative CT scan.
Antibiotic treatment was distinguished in prophylactic and therapeutic. Prophylaxis (ceftriaxone 1 g 2 h preoperatively, then 6 h after surgery) was used in all cases where no signs of infection could be clearly preoperatively evidenced at the laboratory or instrumental examinations.
Large spectrum therapy (meropenem 1 g 3 times a day, teicoplanin 400 mg as starting dose, then 200 mg two times a day) was started in the immediately postoperative period in cases of inflammatory indexes positivity, clinical evidence of purulent collections, autologous/artificial cranioplasty involvement at neuroradiological examinations, to allow intraoperative sampling for identification of the causative agent. Treatment modifications were decided on the following positivity. Targeted therapy was preoperatively started in the two only patients affected by multiresistant bacteria (Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and prolonged for at least 2 weeks after surgery. On the basis of their appearance, skin flap lesions were classified into three main types, according to a simplified scheme: 1. Dehiscence: Defined as a diastase of facing flap borders
occurring along the line of suture, with different degrees of exposure of underlying tissues: 28 cases [Figure 1a]
2. Ulcer: Defined as a loss of substance occurring inside the skin flap, usually distant from the line of

Figure 1: Three different kinds of flap lesions may be observed in patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy or postdecompressive cranioplasty, flap dehiscence, flap ulceration, and flap necrosis. (a) Dehiscence occurring along a left fronto-temporoparietal decompressive craniectomy. (b) Ulceration occurring in the middle of a left fronto-temporo-parietal flap. (c) In detail, bone is clearly visible under the ulcer. (d) Large necrosis in the temporoparietal area of a left hemispheric flap
suture, constantly presenting with underlying tissues exposure: 6 cases [Figure 1b and c] 3. Necrosis: Defined as a large, discolored area of complete loss of skin viability, both on flap contour and on the surrounding skin border, never associated to the exposure of subjacent tissues, always occurring after cranioplasty in unilateral craniectomy, preferentially on the temporoparietal region: 4 cases [Figure 1c and d].
RESULTS
Dehiscence occurred after DC procedures in 17 cases [Table 1]. It presented 2-6 weeks after stitches removal. Relying on lesion dimensions and the degree of exposure of underlying tissues, treatment was performed either by a limited or a full flap reopening. The appearance of dehiscence was attributed to CSF leak in 5 cases, early resurgery for shortterm postoperative complications in 3, extreme flap tension due to malignant swelling in 6, and bed sores in 3. An external CSF drainage (ventricular: 5; lumbar: 3) was used in eight cases, to treat leaks and/or to relieve pressure on flap borders. Wound borders curettage with excision of lesioned skin and resuture was

successfully performed in eight patients. In both the cases of decompression for meningoencephalitis intradural toilette was needed, followed by autologous duraplasty by fascia lata/pericranium and resuture [Figure 2]. Patients with massive postoperative brain swelling developing dehiscence were usually treated in the first instance by daily bandaging with iodine gauzes; within 2 weeks flap tension was relieved and resuturing could take place. This solution failed in two cases, requiring resurgery by an advancement flap in one case and dural reopening followed by removal of a large portion of necrotic temporal lobe tissue (brain infarction), fascia lata duraplasty, and borders resuture in the second.
Dehiscence was also observed after AB cranioplasty (five patients), PMMA (two patients), hydroxyapatite (two patients), and preformed titanium (two patients) [Table 1]. Its development was attributed to early resurgery in two cases, flap retraction in three, multiple surgeries in three, and retraction in three. Borders toilette and resuture were successful in three patients, unsuccessful in three, leading to cranioplasty removal and new cranioplasty at 6 months. An advancement flap was performed in three cases, a free flap from the right radial forearm [Figure 3] in one, and Zplasty in two. The development of an ulcer inside a decompressive or postcranioplasty flap is a severe and challenging condition. In our series, six patients were affected by such kind of lesion [Table 2]. Five patients had been previously treated by cranioplasty with AB and one by PMMA. Depending on the site of tissue loss, an advancement flap supplemented with a free thigh dermal graft was considered the best treatment option in four cases, Zplasty in one, and free flap in one. Advancement flap failed in two cases, requiring free flaps from the radial forearm and the great dorsal muscle. The most complex case required four surgeries to accomplish full healing, including removal of AB and intraoperative resterilization of a preformed titanium cranioplasty getting exposed because of relapsing infection [Figures 4 and 5]. In our series, flap necrosis was observed in only four cases [Table 3]. It developed within the first 24 h from cranioplasty in three patients, after 72 h in one. Treatment consisted of an advancement flaps and free dermal grafts from radial forearm or thigh within 48 h from lesion appearance, supplemented by large spectrum antibiotic coverage. In three cases flap healing and graft epithelization was complete in 15-18 days, with no further complications at 1, 3, and 6 months followup. A subcutaneous hematoma developed 4 days after surgery in the fourth patient and required emergency evacuation [Figure 6]. Wound healing was complete 15 days after revision. One patient came back to our attention 3 months after discharge because of flap dehiscence in the frontal area and underlying bone exposure. Purulent material ran out of the flap, and at CT scan minimal dural enhancement was discovered at CT scan. At resurgery, the repositioned bone was found eroded

DISCUSSION
DC effectiveness is still controverse. Though its positive impact on malignant intracranial hypertension unresponsive to maximal medical treatment is well established, there seems not be an equivalent

correlation between patient's survival rate and good outcomes. To further increase confusion, larger series in literature include patients treated by different techniques, bifrontal craniectomy, hemicraniectomy, and bilateral hemicraniectomy. Bifrontal DC is indicated in patients affected by diffuse traumatic brain injury or in cases where bifrontal contusions are causing mass effect and need prompt surgical evacuation. Hemicraniectomy (frontotemporoparietal or frontotemporoparietooccipital) is commonly used

The use of bilateral DC is infrequent, only occasionally reported and reserved to patients presenting lesions with mass effect evolving at different stages.
Complications occurring after DC and cranioplasty

have been described quite recently in a small number of papers.[1,3,4] The list of postdecompressive adverse events has grown with time and includes either frequently occurring phenomena, like subdural hygromas, hydrocephalus, epidural hematomas, brain lacerations, subdural hematomas, malignant brain swelling, and rarer conditions, like paradoxical brain herniation and sinking flap syndrome.[3,8] In some of the abovementioned

papers, authors also include complications taking place at the moment of postdecompressive cranioplasty, including infection, bone resorption, epidural hematomas, and bone flap displacement.[2,5,6] The exact incidence of these complications has not been established yet and even their etiopathogenesis is sometimes hard to explain, as it happens for the sinking flap syndrome. Nonetheless, all authors agree that such complications are always a serious event and that, if underestimated, they may have a significant negative impact on patient's prognosis, leading

to further neurological deterioration (even in improving patients), and eventually to death. Wound complications have been only occasionally mentioned in literature, no paper focusing attention on this topic. It was exactly this consideration, the real lack of information on such a problem when facing the management of the first cases in our series that made us aware of the need to develop a patients' database, distinguishing the different lesions, and adopting treatment schemes according not only to the lesion itself but also to patients conditions. Actually,
S743

SNI: Trauma 2016,Vol 7: Suppl 28 - A Supplement to Surgical Neurology International

clinical conditions of craniectomized patients are rarely optimal, which means that timing of major surgeries like free flaps or rotation flaps (implying a potential for major blood loss) must be accurately selected. Nonetheless, apparently minor impact procedures, like a revision of flap borders, positioning of external shunts to accelerate flap detension and healing, can be followed by complications too, especially in patients known to harbor infections from multidrugresistant bacteria. In our experience, especially in these cases, flap healing is one of the most important elements contributing to outcome.
As summarized above, we tried to highlight the etiology of flap lesions case by case. For what is concerning to dehiscences, we observed two leading causes of flap failure after decompression: CSF circulation disturbances and malignant postdecompressive brain swelling. On the counterpart, dehiscences followed cranioplasty essentially because of poor preoperative flap conditions (sinking and multiple surgeries). Ulcers always came associated with an underlying infection of AB or cranioplasty and were never observed in craniectomized patients. In our series, necrosis was ascribed to inadvertent sacrifice of the residual arterial supply after flap reopening in three cases, to venous congestion in 1.
Even if in our experience we were able to find a direct correlation between flap incision and wound complications only in necrosis, some basic principles should be always kept in mind when performing DC. Flap shape needs to be tailored to patient's anatomy, especially in cases where vascularization may be already compromised (previous surgery on the same side of decompression, scars, irregular scalp lesions as in trauma). ICP monitors must be strategically placed. If put on the same side which could need decompression, it should ideally be placed along the theoretical flap course (frontal region, 2-3 cm lateral to the midline), rather than inside it. In cases where decompression might be required but it is not certain, it is definitely better to raise a larger flap, to avoid last minute transverse incisions, which almost inevitably lead to healing difficulties and increase the risk of breakdown at reopening. In hemicraniectomy, flap does not need to go beyond the midline, but if a very low frontal access is required (e.g., to access frontobasal contusions), it is better to shape a curve following the contralateral hairline than cutting a straight line going through the forehead that would presumably compromise the support from supratrochlear and supraorbital arteries. Even if time spending, isolation, and preservation of the superficial temporal artery and the surrounding veins should always be sought, It requires just a few more minutes but reduces significantly the risks of compromise of flap circulation and it is especially valuable in bifrontal DC. To this aim, when starting incision at tragus, there is no need to overrun the zygomatic arch and monopolar coagulation is to be avoided. In patients undergoing

hemicraniectomy, the temporal incision should be done 2 cm above the ear, then follow a curve line along the temporal contour at the same level. Because of the poor local vascularization, going below and behind the ear limits the possibility of mobilizing the skin and increases the risks of flap failure. The same exposure of the temporal bone can be obtained with a higher incision and then by retracting the skin by hooks or stitches. The recommended posterior extension of unilateral decompressive flaps is 2-3 cm behind the ear, but to expose enough bone it should be not <5. However, care is not needed to compromise the vascular support from the occipital artery and the posterior midline should not be reached by the incision unless the lesion to treat resides in that area.
Finally, in bifrontal flaps, the coronal portion of incision should preferably follow the coronaric suture or go 2-3 cm behind it.
Coming back to the literature, we would say complications affecting skin flaps after decompression or cranioplasty seem to occupy no space in major authors' experience, especially in larger series, where we expected the most to find some information. In the work of Honeybul and Ho, no cutaneous problems affecting decompressive flaps were mentioned.[4] In both papers of Gooch et al. and Ban et al., wound complications were not cited at all.[1,3] In Walcott et al. paper, complications of wound healing were reported in four patients out of 57, but there was no complication description neither detail about its treatment.[8] In the series of Schuss et al., wound complications occurred in 9 patients out of 40, but even in this paper, no description of lesion type and treatment modality was given.[6] In the work of Sobani et al., three cases of superficial wound infections were reported without any mention of treatment.[7] Why is that? Were these patients treated by other specialists? We feel that this is one of the most important points to highlight. The experience with flap complications in this peculiar group of patients was increased by the constant cooperation and case by case discussion with plastic surgeons, leading to the development of new strategies aimed at reducing the incidence of adverse events, including minimization of the use of skin clamps (we prefer hydrogen peroxide soaked gauzed wrapped along flap borders) and bipolar coagulation and no use of monopolar coagulation. We also use to relieve periodically pressure on the retracted flap during both the decompressive and reconstructive procedure, to protect flap microcirculation. Finally, we have increased the use of subcutaneous suture, minimizing skin stitches. Further observations will be needed to prove the real effectiveness of these measures. As a final consideration, it is necessary to say we feel that the classification for skin flap lesions we propose is an oversimplification and further work and an increased number of observations

S744

SNI: Trauma 2016,Vol 7: Suppl 28 - A Supplement to Surgical Neurology International

will be needed to improve it. Nonetheless, it seemed to fit well all of the patients treated, helping to discriminate if resurgery was mandatory, if it could be performed by the neurosurgeon alone or needed cooperation with a plastic surgeon, and well balancing the relationship between reoperation risks and benefits. Relying on the different presentation of the classified lesions, the proposed treatment seems to be effective in most of the cases. Dehiscences are presumed to be the easier problem we can deal with. This is a true statement if they are promptly observed and treated. Unfortunately, patients can develop dehiscences in a variable amount of time from surgery, so they can come to the attention of the neurosurgeon when they are yet complicated. On the other side, ulcers are a really challenging problem. In these patients, "closing the skin" is rarely the main problem. The decision whether or not to remove an AB getting exposed after the overlying skin flap becomes dehiscent may be troubleshooting, becoming even more difficult if a cranial prosthesis is involved. We take this decision only after an accurate case examination in cooperation with plastic surgeons. We always have to keep in mind that cranioplasty removal might expose even patients in good clinical conditions to sudden or further deterioration so that an accurate evaluation of the least possible harm should always be performed. This is particularly true in patients harboring shunts contralateral to cranioplasty (which is a quite common condition), where the potential for adverse events (subdural hematoma, hygroma, and sinking flap syndrome) related to unopposed deliquoration is extremely high. Moreover, in patients with AB exposure, the possibility of reestablishing a physiological intracranial compartment will be lost forever. Ulcer seems to be strictly associated to infection, and we all have grown with the idea that cranioplasty (either autologous or artificial) infection has to be treated by bone or implant removal until full healing of the surgical field is obtained. In the modern era, the availability of powerful antibiotics and the possibility for new cranioplasty materials to be intraoperatively resterilized have significantly reduced the need for cranioplasty removal, even in the case of synthetic implants. Paradoxically, in our experience, the major risks of surgical failure seemed to be related to exposure of AB, the sparing of which might unpredictably be a total success or a dramatic in success. In our series, flap necrosis was a rare event but also the most feared one because of the potentially related complications, including infection, overlying skin dehiscence, and bone contamination. In such patients, bone is not exposed so it could be spared, but risks of infection are extremely high so that we prefer to adopt a nodelay behavior. Problems of resurgery are essentially related to the exceedingly short time passed from cranioplasty, to adjunctive intraoperative and immediate

postoperative blood loss and to the need to understand as soon as possible how much of the flap around the necrotic area was still viable, so to decide the extension of dead tissue removal and the dimensions of the graft required to cover the defect. Summarizing, classifying flap complications can be helpful, but treatment needs a thorough discussion casebycase. As said above, it seems impossible to identify a solution which can perfectly fit every category of wound complication reported. Nonetheless, supported by our experience, we believe that the incidence of these complications may be significantly reduced by using a strategy based on accurate preoperative planning, adoption of intraoperative solutions aimed at the preservation of flap vascularization, accurate wound care in the immediate postdecompressive and postreconstructive period, optimized temporization of cranioplasty, full consideration of previous surgeries, especially where conditions predisposing to higher risk of complication are observed (e.g., sinking flap syndrome).

Abstract Background: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are regarded as vital regulatory factors in various cancers. However, the biological functions of circDNER in the paclitaxel (PTX) resistance of lung cancer remain largely unexplored. Methods: Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze circDNER, miR-139-5p, and ITGB8. Cell proliferation was assessed via colony formation and MTT assays. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. Western blot was performed to assess protein expression. The targeted interaction among circDNER, miR-139-5p, and ITGB8 were validated using dualluciferase reporter or RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Results: Inhibition of circDNER reduced IC50 of PTX, inhibited cell proliferation, invasion and migration, as well as promoted cell apoptosis in PTX-resistant lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, circDNER sponged miR-139-5p to upregulate ITGB8 expression. Overexpression of miR-139-5p reversed the biological functions mediated by circDNER in PTX-resistant lung cancer cells. MiR-139-5p overexpression suppressed PTX resistance and malignant behaviors of PTX-resistant lung cancer cells, with ITGB8 elevation rescued the impacts. Moreover, we demonstrated that circDNER was upregulated in plasma exosomes from lung cancer patients. The plasma exosomes derived from these patients are the key factors enhancing the migration and invasion potential of lung cancer cells. Conclusion: The circDNER mediated miR-139-5p/ITGB8 axis suppresses lung cancer progression. Our findings suggest that circDNER might act as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for lung cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer, a major malignancy, is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.1 Although many therapies, such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, have been applied to treat lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate remains low due to tumor invasion and metastasis as well as lack of effective biomarkers and targets.2 Hence, exploring novel approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer are urgently required.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs that possess a covalent closed loop. To date, it has

been proven that circRNAs play a vital role and participate
in proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in various malignancies, including bladder, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers.3 Previous studies have shown that circRNAs can
regulate tumor pathological progression and may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers of cancer;4-6 however,
whether circDNER influences lung cancer remains unclear.
Exosomes are membrane vesicles produced by various cells and character with diameters ranging from 30-
100 nm. The main functions of exosomes are transferring intercellular signal transduction to recipient cells.7,8 It has

been demonstrated that exosomes are involved in modulating drug response, as well as tumorigenesis, tumor invasion and metastasis by delivering micro (mi)RNA, long noncoding (lnc)RNA, circular (circ) RNA and proteins.9 CircRNA are exceptionally stable in all cargos carried by exosomes.10 However, the mechanism of circRNAs in the exosomes of lung cancer patients remains to be definitively elucidated.
In this study, circDNER was first identified by circRNA microarray analysis in exosomes from the plasma of lung cancer patients. Our data showed that circDNER was obviously upregulated in lung cancer tissues and plasma exosomes of lung cancer patients. Moreover, we found that circDNER competitively binds to miR-139-5p to regulate proliferation, invasion, metastasis and apoptosis via mediating ITGB8 expression in lung cancer. Our findings suggest that circDNER might act as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for the treatment of lung cancer.

CircRNA microarray analysis
A microarray assay was used to analyze the circRNA expression of lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent noncancerous tissues as well as plasma exosome samples collected from the Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University.
Clinical specimens
All human lung cancer tissue samples and plasma samples were obtained from the Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University. The tumors were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. The plasma samples were stored at À80C. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and this study was approved by the ethics committee of Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University.
Exosome isolation
All the samples were prepared by centrifuging for 5 min at 500 g. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min to remove shed macrovesicles. The supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.22 m membrane filter. Finally, the supernatant was centrifuged at 110 000 g for 70 min.

BEAS-2B, HCC827, A549 and H1975 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin- streptomycin (Gibco). H1299 and H460 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin- streptomycin. All cells were incubated at 37C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Cell transfection
Plasmids containing sh-circDNER and sh-NC, circDNER or ITGB8 overexpression vector, miR-139-5p mimics and miRNC, miR-139-5p inhibitor and anti-miR-NC were designed and transfected into lung cancer cells for up- or downregulating target genes according to the manufacturer's protocol. All plasmids were synthesized by GeneChem.
RNA isolation and qRT-PCR
The total RNA of samples was isolated by RNAiso Plus reagent (Takara) according to the manufacturer's protocol. ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Kit (TaKaRa) was used to obtain cDNA. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using ABI 7500 StepOnePlus system (Applied Biosystems). -actin were used as internal controls and each reaction was performed in triplicate. All primers are shown in Supplemental file 1.
Colony formation, invasion and migration assays
The transfected cells were seeded in a 6-well plate for 14 days. The colonies were fixed with ethanol (75%, Beyotime), followed by staining with violet (0.1%, Beyotime). Finally, colonies (>50 cells/colony) were counted and photographed.
The transfected cells were resuspended with serum-free medium and seeded in the transwell upper chamber. Then, 500 l of DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added to the transwell lower chamber. After incubation for 48 h, the chambers were stained with 0.5% crystal violet and counted under a Nikon microscope (Minato).

incubation with RIP immunoprecipitation buffer. Proteinase K buffer was then added to the samples. After purifying, all RNAs were analyzed by qRT-PCR.

Dual-luciferase reporter assay
The putative binding sequence of miR-139-5p and circDNER or ITGB8 was predicted by Circinteractome or TargetScan. Wild-type (WT) sequencing of circDNER or ITGB8 30UTR with binding sequence for miR-139-5p was cloned into the pmirGLO vector (YouBia) to construct WTcircDNER or WT- ITGB8 30UTR. At the same time, mutant reporter plasmids (MUT-circDNER or MUT-ITGB8 30UTR) without binding sequence for miR-139-5p were generated in the same way. The indicated vector and miR-NC/miR139-5p were then cotransfected into A549/PTX cells. After 48 h of cotransfection, a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) was used to examine luciferase activity.

Western blot (WB)
The samples were lysed in RIPA buffer (Beyotime), separated using 10% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h and then incubated with diluted primary antibodies to CD 63 (1:1000, ab118307), HSP70 (1:1000, ab2787), TSG101 (1:1000, ab125011), ITGB8 (1:2000, ab80673) and GAPDH (1:2000, ab371685) overnight at 4C. After washing with TBST for three times, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibodies for 35 min at room temperature. The relative levels of proteins were analyzed by calculating the ratio of the gray value.

Six weeks later, the mice were euthanized and the xenograft tumors were surgically resected. The animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University.

RESULTS
CircDNER is significantly upregulated in lung cancer tissues and cells, and increased circDNER expression predicts poor prognosis
To explore the effect of circDNER in the pathogenesis of lung cancer, GSE101684 microarray analysis was performed to evaluate numerous dysregulated circRNAs in tumor tissues. The analysis showed that circDNER was significantly upregulated in lung cancer tissue (Figure 1a, b), which indicated circDNER might play a crucial role in the development of lung cancer. At the same time, using qRT-PCR, we found that circDNER was obviously increased in lung cancer tissue and A549 cells (Figure 1c,

from PTX-resistant cell culture media. First, exosomes of A549/PTX cells were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 2a). Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) further confirmed that the dominant size of vesicles was 100 nm, and concentrations at 100 nm multiplied by dilution factors produced concentrations of 4.5 Â 108/ml for A549 and 9.6 Â 108/ml for A549/PTX, respectively (Figure 2b). We examined the exosomal markers CD63, HSP70 and Tsg101 by western blotting. The data showed that higher levels of CD63, HSP70 and Tsg101 were discovered confirming the purity of the exosomes (Figure 2c). Moreover, circDNER expression in A549 cells was strikingly lower than in A549/PTX cells (Figure 2d). In addition,

markedly higher expression of circDNER and IC50 values were observed after treatment with exosomes (Figure 2e,f). To investigate the function of circDNER in vivo, a mice xenograft model was established. The data showed that A549 + PTX Exo + PTX group mice promoted tumor growth (Figures 2g-j).

(f) The correlation between miR-139-5p expression and ITGB8 mRNA expression in PTX-resistant tissues was analyzed. (g) The abundance of ITGB8 was detected in A549/PTX cells after transfection with miR-NC or miR-139-5p.

cells (A549/PTX) (Figure 3a). Meanwhile, we analyzed the circDNER expression in PTX-senstive or PTX-resistant tumor tissue, and found that circDNER expression was increased in PTX-resistant tumor tissue and cells (Figures 3b,c). To further confirm the effect of circDNER in PTX resistance, we next examined whether knockdown of circDNER would resensitize these cells to PTX treatment. We silenced circDNER expression by transfection of sh-circDNER. We found that IC50 value of PTX was decreased after knockdown of circDNER (Figure 3d,e).
To demonstrate the effect of circDNER on lung cancer cells, we examined cell proliferation using clone formation assays. Our findings suggested that silencing circDNER could obviously inhibit the proliferation of A549/PTX cells (Figure 3f). Flow cytometry data showed that silencing circDNER promoted cell apoptosis (Figure 3g). A transwell assay was utilized to detect cell invasion and motility. The results were consistent with proliferation, which indicated that downregulation of circDNER markedly restrained cell invasion and motility (Figure 3h,i). Together, these data implicated that circDNER downregulation could resensitize A549/PTX.
CircDNER serves as a miRNA sponge for miR139-5p
It has previously been determined that circRNAs can serve as miRNA sponges to regulate miRNA targets.12 We next explored the ability of circDNER to bind miRNAs. Our results indicated that the potential interactions between miR-139-5p and circDNER by online databases starBase,

circNet, and RNA22 (Figure 4a). We observed that miR139-5p upregulation obviously decreased the luciferase activity in the WT-circDNER group but not in the MUTcircDNER group (Figure 4b). Moreover, lower expression of miR-139-5p was observed in resistant tissues and A549/PTX cells (Figure 4c,d). To assess the binding capacity of circDNER and miR-139-5p, RIP assays were performed which demonstrated that circDNER can bind with miR-139-5p (Figure 4e). As shown in Figure 4e, miR-139-5p expression was negatively correlated with circ DNER expression in lung cancer tissue (Figure 4f). Furthermore, miR-139-5p expression was increased when circDNER was silenced in PTXresistant cells. These data concluded that circDNER directly targeted miR-139-5p.
Silencing CircDNER enhanced PTX sensitivity in A549/PTX cells by upregulating miR-139-5p
To investigate whether miR-139-5p mediated the function of sh-circDNER, rescue experiments were performed in A549/PTX. Higher expression of miR-139-5p was observed by downregulating circDNER, which was attenuated by inhibiting miR-139-5p (Figure S1). Additionally, we found that miR-139-5p inhibition reduced the suppressive effects of knockdown circDNER colony-forming ability (Figure 5a). Moreover, miR-139-5p silencing reversed sh-circDNERtriggered cell apoptosis (Figure 5b). Meanwhile, the inhibitory effects of circDNER knockdown on migration and invasion were also counteracted by interference of miR-139-5p (Figure 5c,d). In summary, circDNER mediated PTX sensitivity by targeting miR-139-5p.

CircDNER regulates expression of ITGB8 via miR-139-5p
It is well known that miRNAs mediate biological functions by directly targeting mRNAs.13,14 We identified five genes that were screened in lung cancer cells transfected with mimic-miR-139-5p and inhibitor-miR-139-5p. The results showed that ITGB8 exhibited the most obvious change after treatment with mimic-miR-139-5p and inhibitor-miR139-5p Figure S2). Complementary sites between miR139-5p and ITGB8 were observed in Figure 6a, suggesting that miR-139-5p might directly target ITGB8. Moreover, we observed that miR-139-5p upregulation obviously decreased luciferase activity in the WT-ITGB8 group but not in the MUT-TGB8 group (Figure 6b). Meanwhile, the expression of ITGB8 including mRNA and protein was higher in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues (Figure 6c,d). RIP

assays demonstrated that miR-139-5p could target ITGB8 (Figure 6e). In addition, the expression of ITGB8 was negatively modulated by miR-139-5p. There was a higher expression of ITGB8 in lung cancer than in corresponding paracancerous tissues (Figure 6f). Additionally, we found that overexpression of miR-139-5p inhibited the ITGB8 protein level in A549/PTX cells. In this study, we found that miR-139-5p directly targeted ITGB8 and negatively mediated its expression in A549/PTX cells.

downregulating miR-139-5p in A549/PTX cells clearly inhibited ITGB8 expression, while ITGB8 overexpression counteracted the inhibition effect of miR-139-5p on ITGB8 expression (Figure 7a). In addition, we observed that overexpression of miR-139-5p suppressed the colony-forming ability and promoted the cell apoptosis, while addition of ITGB8 could reverse the effect (Figure 7b,c). Moreover, enforced expression miR-139-5p repressed migration and invasion of A549/PTX and the effect could be abated after overexpression of ITGB8 (Figure 7d,e).
CircDNER meditates ITGB8 expression by binding with miR-139-5p
Finally, we investigated whether circDNER could regulate ITGB8 expression by sponging miR-139-5p. Our data indicated that knockdown of circDNER decreased TPD52 protein expression, while silencing miR-139-5p could reverse the impact (Figure 8a), which indicated that circDNER could regulate ITGB88 expression by sponging miR-139-5p. A schematic diagram of the mechanism was created and is shown in Figure 8b.

DISCUSSION
Lung cancer is a common cancer characterized by high recurrence and poor 5-year survival rates.15 A number of therapies which have been applied for the treatment of lung cancer have failed due to lack of specific molecular targets and effective interventions.16 Therefore, searching for novel genetic targets and the pursuit of prognostic markers are critical for lung cancer.
In recent years, RNAs (circRNAs) have attracted great attention and have been shown to have a close relationship with various human malignant tumors.17,18 Previous studies have found that circ_0002346 and circ_0001658 are downregulated in lung cancer, which are positively correlated with tumor size, lymphatic invasion, or lymph node metastasis in patients. In our study, we found upregulated expression of circDNER in lung cancer tissues and cells, suggesting circDNER could promote lung cancer proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo, hence downregulating the circDNER had the opposite effect. It is well accepted that circRNAs can negatively regulate miRNA activity.11 Our data indicated that circ DNER increased lung cancer invasion and metastasis by sponging miR-139-5p which had been reported was downregulated in human tumors.19 Our finding is consistent with previous studies.

1390
Integrin beta-8 (ITGB8) has been shown to be essential for tumor cell survival and serves as a target gene of miR-139-5p according to our data. As a master regulator of angiogenesis, ITGB8 has previously been reported to correlate with poor prognosis in various malignancies.20 In our study, we implicated for the first time that circ DNER promoted lung cancer proliferation, invasion and metastasis by modulating ITGB8 expression via sponging miR-139-5p, implying a novel regulatory axis formed by circ DNER /miR-139-5p/ITGB8 in lung cancer.
Exosomes are small endosomal-derived membrane microvesicles with a diameter of approximately 30-100 nm, which can be actively secreted by a variety of cells.21 A number of studies have demonstrated that exosomes are enriched in circRNAs, which may regulate tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion.22,23 Previous studies have shown that exosomal circ-ciRS122 mediates PKM2 in colorectal cancer cell lines and that plasma exosomal circ-PDE8A is associated with tumor invasion.11,24 Plasma exosomal circular RNA circ-RanGAP1 modulates VEGFA expression by targeting miR-877-3p to facilitate invasion and metastasis.14 In this study, we demonstrated that plasma exosomal circDNER transferred from lung cancer cells increased lung cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration, elucidating a novel mechanism of tumor metastasis in lung cancer. Moreover, our results demonstrated that plasma exosomal circ DNER can act as a tumor marker to distinguish between tumor patients and healthy people. Certainly, this conclusion needs further experimental and clinical studies to be confirmed.

Abstract
Aim: The main purpose of this study was to identify myocardial changes in malnourished children.
Material and Methods: This prospective study included 47 patients with malnutrition and 44 healthy controls. The subjects who had malnutrition were classified according to the method of Gomez and Waterlow. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examinations, 24-h Holter monitoring, and biochemical assessments were performed in all subjects.
Results: The malnutrition group included 20 (42.5%) males, and the control group included 19 (43.1%) males (p<0.05). There was no difference between the malnutrition and control groups with regard to mean age (69.4±57.3 months and 68.9±48.2 months, respectively, p=0.5). Although the left ventricular mass was lower in the patient group compared with the control group, the left ventricular mass index was not different (42.3±24.5 g, 53.4±23.9 g, p=0.049 and 60.7±13.3 g/m2, 61.9±12.1 g/ m2, p=0.67, respectively). The left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening were lower in the patient group compared with the control group (66.2±5.3%, 69.2±4.07%, p=0.04 and 35.4±4.2%, 37.9±3.4%, p=0.03, respectively). The myocardial performance index was higher in the patient group (0.45±0.09, 0.36±0.05, respectively, p=0.001). The deterioration of cardiac functions was associated with the severity and duration of malnutrition. Troponin concentrations were not elevated in any patients. The corrected QT dispersion was significantly higher in patients with malnutrition (47.9±16.8, 32.9±10.6, respectively, p=0.001). Complex ventricular arrhythmias were not noted in any patients.
Conclusion: The malnourished children in this study exhibited impairment in the functions of cardiac contraction including mainly systolic functions and in cardiac conduction system. Cardiac morbidity and mortality can be prevented by early detection and treatment of malnutrition in these patients.

Introduction
Malnutrition is a clinical condition that occurs when inadequate or unbalanced intake of one or multiple nutrients, which are essential for growth and development, is present such that the body's balance is disrupted, and this condition needs to be monitored (1-3). This condition mostly affects children and contributes to mortality in a significant portion of pediatric deaths. The etiology is multifactorial (economic, psychosocial, cultural, geographic) and is one of the most important health problems worldwide, including mostly developing countries (1, 3-6).
In malnutrition, anatomic and functional changes develop in the cardiovascular system as in all systems (2, 7-9). The effect of the degree and type of malnutrition on cardiac functions has not been investigated adequately (8, 9). Cardiovascular disorders including hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and in some cases, sudden death, have been reported in malnutrition. However, it has not been elucidated if these disorders are primary disorders related to malnutrition or if they are related to accompanying sepsis, dehydratation or severe anemia. Although most investigators agree that atrophy in the heart is present in patients with severe malnutriton, the question as to whether left ventricular functions are preserved in atrophic heart is controversial (6, 8, 9).
In malnutrition, impairment in cardiac electrical activity occurs in addition to myocardial tissue loss and morphologic changes at a cellular level (10-12). Studies have reported that the cardiac repolarization time prolongs and more importantly, repolarization is irregular in children with malnutrition (10, 11, 13, 14). It has been reported that prolongation in the ventricular repolarization time and/ or heterogeneous repolarizaton increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and may lead to sudden cardiac death (15, 16). Some studies reported that this prolongation in the repolarization time was corrected with treatment (17).
In this study, it was aimed to investigate cardiac structural and functional changes that develop in relation to malnutriton and influence mortality and morbidity in children with malnutrition.

Ethics committee aprroval was obtained from Firat University Faculty of Medicine Local Ethics Committee for this study (02.06.2011/0909). The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Decleration of Helsinki. The study received financial support from Firat University Scientific Research Project Support Fund. Written consent was obtained from the parents of the patients who participated in the study.
The children whose weights for age were below 90% according to the percentile values published by Olcay Neyzi in 2008 in a study conducted with Turkish children, were included in the patient group (18). This group was divided into subgroups as mild, moderate, and severe malnutrition according to the Gomez classification and as acute malnutrition, chronic malnutrition and acute malnutrition with chronic background according to the Waterlow classification (19, 20).
Age- and sex-matched healthy children who presented to the Pediatric Cardiology Outpatient Clinic because of cardiac murmur, had no other problems on physical examination, were diagnosed as having innocent murmur with normal complete blood count, biochemical tests, echocardiographic and electrocardiographic findings were included in the control group.
Children who were preterm (<35 gestational weeks, for <2 years) and who had intrauterine growth retardation (for <2 years), severe anemia (hemoglobin <6 g/dL), chronic disease, and primary cardiac pathology were excluded from the study.
Detailed history was taken and a complete physical examination was performed in all patients who constituted the study group. Body weight, height and blood pressure (measured in the right upper extremity) values were recorded. Presence of reduction in the subcutaneous adipose tissue and edema was recorded. In all subjects in the study and control groups, complete blood count, serum sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, urea, creatinine, glucose, total protein, albumin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), total creatinine kinase (CK), creatinine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) and troponin I concentrations were measured.

Material and Methods The study was conducted with two groups including a patient and control group. Patients who presented to the outpatient clinics in Department of Pediatrics aged between 1 month and 18 years and were investigated and treated as outpatients or inpatients were included in this study.

A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed in all subjects in the study group. The QT interval was measured in at least 9 derivations on electrocardiogram. The QTc value was calculated by correcting the QT interval by heart rate using the Bazett formula (QTc= QT value measured/R-R). The QT dispersion (QDT) value was found by calculating the difference between the minimum and

maximum QT values and the QTc dispersion (QTcD) value was found by calculating the difference between the minimum and maximum QTc values in all patients. All measurements were performed manually.
Twenty-four-hour ECG recording was obtained in 40 subjects in the patient group and in 35 subjects in the control group using a DMS 300-7 three-channel Holter recording device (DMS, Nevada, USA). The recordings were analyzed using a DMS Cardioscan 10 (model 21) Holter analyzer system (DMS, Nevada, USA).
Echocardiographic images were obtained with the patient in the supine position or in the 45-degree left lateral decubitus position using GE Vivid 7 ultrasound system (Version Pro 1.4.0) and 3S and 7S probes. Echocardiographic examinations were performed in accordance with the standard imaging techniques recommeded by the American Society of Echocardiyoraphy (ASE). Ventricular systolic and diastolic functions were calculated by using the mean values of at least 3 measurements in the positions recommeded by the ASE.
The intraventricular septum diastolic diameter (IVSDd) and intraventricular septum systolic diameter (IVSDs), left ventricular end-diastolic internal diameter (LVIDd), left ventricular end-systolic internal diameter (LVIDs), left ventricular posterior wall thickness in end-diastole (LVPWd), and left ventricular posterior wall thickness in end-systole (LVPWs) were calculated using an M-mode echocardiogram. Left ventricular mass (LMV), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV), left ventricular endsystolic volume (ESV), ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), and stroke volume (SV) were calculated using the Teichholz formula. In addition, cardiac output (CO) was calculated by multiplying SV with heart rate per minute. The values found were divided into the body surface area value and IVSDdI, IVSDsI, LVIDdI, LVIDsI, LVPWdI, LVPWsI, LVMI, EDVI, ESVI, CI and SI were calculated.

the mitral valve and opening of the aortic valve (IVCT) and the systole time between opening and closure of the aortic valve (LVET) were measured. The myocardial performance index (MPI) was calculated by dividing the sum of IVRT and IVCT to LVET.
Statistical Analysis The SPSS version 12.0 computer package program for Windows was used for statistical analysis. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The Chi-square test was used for the evaluation of categorical variables. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for analyses between groups that were not compatible with normal distribution. The median values were considered. Student's t-test (for independent samples) was used for measurements that showed normal distribution. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.
Results Forty-seven patients with malnutrition and 44 control patients were included in the study. According to the Gomez classification, seven (14.8%) patients had severe malnutrition, 20 (42.5%) had moderate malnutrition, and 20 (42.5%) had mild malnutrition. According to the Waterlow classification, 15 (31.9%) patients had chronic malnutrition, 21 (44.6%) had acute malnutrition, and 8 (17%) had acute malnutrition with chronic background. There was no difference between the malnoureshed patients and the control patients in terms of age and heart rate. Among the malnutrition groups, the heart rate was found to be higher only in the severe malnutrition group compared with the control group (p<0.05). Hemoglobin, potassium, and calcium concenrations, among biochemical measurements, were found to be significantly lower compared with the control group. The troponin I concentration was not found to be high in any patient. Thirty (38.2%) of the children with malnutrition and one (2.2%) child in the control group had illiterate mothers. The difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). The general characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1.

When assessing left ventricular diastolic functions, left ventricular entrance flows were recorded in the mitral valve ends using pulse wave (PW) Doppler in the apical four-chamber position. Among the recordings obtained, the average of at least 3 measurements was found and early diastolic flow velocity (E), late diastolic flow velocity (A), E acceleration time (EAT), and E deceleration time (DT) were measured and the E/A ratio was calculated. The left ventricular output flow and enterance flow were recorded together in the appropriate positions and the interval between closure of the aortic valve and opening of the mitral valve (IVRT), the interval between closure of

Electrocargiogram revealed that the QTD and QTcD times were prolonged in the malnutrition group compared with the control group (p<0.01). An intergroup examination of the subjects' ECG data is shown in Table 2.
Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring was performed in 40 of 47 patients in the patient group and in 35 of 44 patients in the control group. In the malnutrition group, frequent supraventricular beats were observed in three patients, rare supraventricular beats were found in seven patients, first-degree AV block was observed in one patient, and unifocal ventricular preterm beats were ob-

served in one patient. In the control group, abnormal Holter monitoring findings were not observed except for rare supraventricular beats in six patients. Complex ventricular arrhythmia was not observed in any patients.
Left ventricular EF and FS were found to be significantly lower in the malnutrition group compared with the control group (p<0.05). Intergroup examinations of the subjects' M-mode values are shown in Table 3. LV systolic functions were additionaly examined in the acute and chronic malnutrition groups in order to investigate the

effect of the duration of malnutrition on left ventricular systolic functions. In this examination, the EF and FS values were found to be significantly lower in the chronic malnutrition groups compared with the acute malnutrition group. Change in cardiac functions according to the time and severity of malnutrition is shown in Table 4.
In the PW Doppler examination, the IVRT, IVCT, and MPI values were found to be significantly high in the patient group (p<0.05). An intergroup examination of the subjects' PW Doppler measurements is shown in Table 5.

Discussion In malnutrition, anatomic and functional changes occur in the cardiovascular system as in all systems (2, 7-9). In this study, the cardiac effects of malnutrition were evluated echocardiographically and electrocardiographically.
The parents' and especially the mother's level of education has an important role in child nutrition (5). In our study, the mothers' education levels were found to be markedly lower in the malnourished patients compared with the control group. This finding suggests that malnutrition is a social problem as well as being a medical problem.
One of the findings that has been investigated in patients with malnutrition and caused excitement is impairments in the heart's electrical activity (10, 12, 14, 17, 21). Many studes have reported that prolonged and/or heterogeneous ventricular repolarization time increases the risk for ventricular arrhythmia (10-13, 15, 22). It is thought that the areas of ventricular myocardium that show slow conduction cause an increase in QTD, and ventricular tachycardia develop from these areas by way of a `reentrant' mechanism (12, 13, 15, 22). In studies conducted with adolescents with anorexia nervosa and children with malnutrition, it was reported that the cardiac repolarization time was prolonged and more importantly, repolariza-

tion was irregular (10, 11, 13, 23). In patients with anorexia nervosa who died suddenly, it was reported that ECGs performed shortly before the patient died revealed prolongation in the QT interval and ventricular tachycardia (24-26). Occurence of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in obese patients who lose weight rapidly suggests that there might be a tendency to ventricular arrhythmias in malnutrition (27-29).
In our study, the QTD and QTcD values were found to be markedly higher in the malnutrition group compared with the control group. This finding was compatible with the literature data (11-14). Some investigators could not demonstrate a correlation between the degree of malnutrition and electrocardiographic measurements (12, 23). However, these studies included a low number of subjects or most subjects had mild malnutrition. On the other hand, a study conducted by Swenne et al. (11) with patients who had anorexia nervosa showed that the reduction rate and velocity in body weight influenced the QTc and QTcD values.
Although QTcD was studied frequently in patients with malnutrition and it was proposed that an increase in QTcD caused ventricular arrhythmias and sudden deaths, Holter monitoring was not performed to strengthen this thesis proposed in these groups as far as we know. In our

Akdeniz et al. Cardiac evaluation in malnutrition

study, unifocal premature ventricular beats were observed in only one patient in the patient group in whom 24-hour Holter monitoring was performed, and complex ventricular arrhythmia was not observed in any patients. The fact that we did not observe ventricular arrhythmia may be related to the low number of subjects in our study or other factors influencing occurence of arrhythmias.
Although most investigators agree that there is a reduction in cardiac mass in patients with malnutrition, the question as to whether left ventricular functions are preserved is controversial (6, 8, 9, 30-32). The initial findings related to change of cardiac mass in patients with malnutrition are based on postmortem studies. In an autopsy study performed by Kerpel-Fronius and Varga (31) in 1949, it was shown that a 60% reduction occured in cardiac weight in patients with malnutrition. In another autopsy study, the cardiac weight to body weight ratio was found to be higher in patients with malnutrition compared with the control group, though a reduction in LVM occured (33). Many studies also echocardiographically showed that cardiac weight was reduced (6, 8, 9, 32, 34). In our study, LVM was found to be lower in the malnutrition group compared with the conrol group, whereas LVMI showed bo difference between the two groups in accordance with many other studies (8, 9). In the analysis performed between the malnutrition subgroups, there was no difference in terms of LVMI values. These results showed that the heart was affected in children with malnutrition like the other organs, but reduction in cardiac mass was proportional to the reduction in body mass. In the malnutrition group, ESVI and LVIDsI were found to be higher compared with the control group. This finding may be related to the reduction in left ventricular findings in patients with malnutrition.
There is no consensus in the issue of the effect of malnutrition on left ventricular systolic functions (6, 8). In the literature, EF and FS values, which are the most commonly studied values to measure left ventricular functions, were found to be unchanged in some studies (6, 32, 34), whereas other investigators found that these measurements were reduced to an important extent, especially in severe malnutrition (8, 9, 14, 35, 36). In our study, the EF and FS values were found to be lower in the malnutrition group compared with the control group. These values were found to be lower in patients with chronic malnutrition compared with those with acute malnutrition. This finding suggests that the heart cannot preserve its systolic functions despite reduced basal metabolism and decreased requirement in prolonged malnutrition. Therefore, we think that malnutrition should be treated before it becomes chronic.

In many studies, it was observed that CO reduced in parallel to the severity of malnutrition in patients with malnutrition, but CI did not change despite this reduction (6, 9). In our study, no differences were found between the malnutrition group and the control group in terms of EDVI, CI, and SI values. The unchanged CI in the patient and control groups shows that CO reduces proportionally with body mass and basal metabolism, and cardiac functional reserve is adequate for reduced circulatory load. However, some studies reported that the CI is low in patients with malnutrition, and becomes normal in the first week of treatment (35).
Studies have shown that cardiac diastolic functions are generally preserved in patients with malnutrition (9, 32). However, some studies reported that cardiac diastolic functions were also influenced, especially in cases of severe malnutrition (37). In a sudy conducted by Fieretto et al. (38) with young rats, it was advocated that changed ventricular geometry prevented impairment in diastolic functions, though passive stiffness was found in the ventricle in malnutrition. Schocken et al. (37) reported that diastolic functions could not be preserved in cases of severe wieght loss. In our study, the E, A, E/A, EAT, DT values, which are echocardiographic indicators of diastolic dysfunction, were not found to be different. In our study, the IVRT value was found to be significantly higher in patients with malnutrition compared with the control group. Prolongation in IVRT may be a sign of diastolic dysfunction related to reduced LV relaxation and decceleration of reduction of the LV pressure.
Myocardial performance index was discovered as a Doppler index that could evaluate left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions together (39). In our study, the MPI values were found to be higher in all malnutrition groups compared with the control group independent of the severity and acute or chronic characteristics of malnutrition, and no significant difference was found between the groups. We think that the MPI values, which were found to be high in these patients, mostly reflected systolic dysfunction.
Although there are studies that found increased troponin concentrations in patients with malnutrition in the literature, additional factors including sepsis, severe infection, severe anemia, and severe electrolyte imbalance are present in these patients, concurrently with malnutrition (8, 32). In our study, troponin concentrations were found to be within the normal limits in all patients. Normal troponin concentrations show that myonecrosis has not developed in the absence of aggravating additional factors. Absence of myonecrosis suggests that cardiac changes may improve following apropriate nutritional treatment.

There are limitations in the study. The patients could not be divided into age groups because the number of the patients was low, but the data were presented by indexing them to body surface area in order to minimize the effect of age. The study was a cross-sectional study and did not involve long-term follow-up.
In conclusion, it was observed that cardiac contraction functions including mainly systolic functions were impaired in children with malnutrition. In these children, increased QTD and QTcD values showed that there was a tendency to ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden deaths could occur. We think that cardiac morbidity and mortality can be prevented in these patients with early diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition.

certain knowledge of obtaining permanent cure with the smallest amount of disfigurement, we must recognise certain symptoms and local conditions which make surgical interference imperalive, namely: (i) symptoms suggesting cerebral complications) (2) pain, usually of the nature of headache, which may be of a very severe and persistent type ; (3) distention of one of the bony walls of the cavity, or the presence of a fistula discharg' ing externally. If the general health of the patient is evidently affected by the continued suppuration, or if he should suffer from great mental depression and anxiety regarding his condition, a state of affairs which sometimes exists in these cases, We should not refrain from urging the operation. So far as we are able to ascertain, we cannot draw definite conclusions as to the percentage of cases of frontal sinus suppuration in which intra' cranial complications arise. That they do occur there is amp^e ?evidence to show, and there is the possibility that they may even occur more frequently than statistics would indicate. The more aggravated symptoms in some cases are relieved by treat'
ing the intranasal condition. If nasal polypi are thoroughly
removed, along with the anterior end of the middle turbinate bone, and the anterior ethmoidal cells opened into, better drain' age may be established and the outflow of secretion rendere
more easy.
Operative procedure.?Notwithstanding numerous opera
tions and their various modifications, many of which are asso ?dated with names of different surgeons, there are only
t^ main principles involved. (1) The sinus is opened and draine
into the nose, but its cavity is preserved ; or, (2) the sinus lS obliterated by the removal of one or more of its bony walls, 50
Ogston-L^C that there is no longer a cavity to deal with. The
operation consists in opening the frontal sinus through lts anterior wall, the size of opening being relative to the dimensi0^5 of the cavity, in careful curetting of its interior, and in esta lishing a large communication between the sinus and the nose' at the same time destroying the anterior ethmoidal cells in the region of the nasofrontal duct. Drainage into the nose insured by the introduction of a strip of gauze through t
ir^ nasofrontal aperture, and the operation is completed by
mediate suture of the skin incision. This operation is probaD y
used more widely than any other, yet results show that the c ^ of cases suitable for it is small, due to anatomical causes.

advises it in all cases even when there is no discomfort beyond
slight nasal discharge. Should a more general and extended
Experience prove equally satisfactory, it is possible that in the
Kalian operation we have at last obtained a method of dealing
vvith chronic frontal sinus suppuration in large and cornPlicated cavities, which may be regarded as the method par excellence. The whole sinus, with its recesses and partitions, is
thoroughly inspected, and the cavity is almost completely
obliterated by the resection of its anterior and inferior bony Vvalls. Further, by the removal of the ascending or frontal Process of the superior maxilla, excellent access is obtained to the ethmoidal cells, and a large opening of communication is thus made between the frontal sinus and the nasal cavity, establishing good drainage. To reduce to a minimum the
deformity which may follow so extensive a dissection, the
Supraorbital bony margin is preserved as a bridge between the ^p formed by removal of the anterior sinus wall and the floor.
Conclusions.?No single method of procedure is applicable in aH cases of chronic suppuration in the frontal sinus. When the sinus is small, and can be thoroughly inspected through an aperture made in anterior wall,and when no ethmoidal disease coexists,
simple opening by the Ogston-Luc method mayprove satisfactory.
In every other class of cases he would recommend and practise obliteration of the sinus by removal of its anterior and inferior walls. Whatever be the exact radical procedure adopted, there ls no doubt of the value of removing the ascending process of the superior maxilla in order to gain better access to the ethmoid labyrinth and nasal cavity.

C ASE REPORT

Huge Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Presenting with

Jaundice: A Case Report

Othman Nasser Al Mulhim
Faculty of Surgery, College of Medicine, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia

Introduction: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) are encountered frequently in the emer­ gency department with an obscure presentation. Most of these aneurysms are incidentally discovered while doing routine imaging studies. This report describes a case of unusual presentation of TAAs. Case Presentation: A 37-year-old male presented to the emergency department with jaundice, shortness of breath, abdominal swelling, and lower limb edema, which worsened during the previous month. The patient was worked up and diagnosed with an ascending aortic aneurysm measuring 6.9 cm associated with severe aortic insufficiency and heart failure. Conclusion: TAA is a life-threatening condition with indistinct signs and symptoms. A high index of suspicion and early implementation of radiological studies are prerequisites to reach a diagnosis. Keywords: ascending aortic aneurysm, thoracic aortic aneurysm, clinical presentation, jaundice, transthoracic echocardiography

Background
Thoracic aortic aneurysms are often silent.1-4 Their diagnosis usually follows
a pathway in which a radiological study is being performed for a different reason, and the aneurysm is discovered coincidentally.5 The etiology of aneurysmal forma­ tion is incompletely understood.6 Most aortic aneurysms are caused by degenera­ tive, infectious, or genetic conditions that weaken the aortic wall.6 Symptomatic
aortic aneurysms may manifest as chest pain, discomfort, a new cardiac murmur, or more drastically as heart failure, aortic dissection, or rupture.6 It is estimated that
21% of patients suffering from acute aortic syndromes die before reaching the hospital.2 Jaundice is mainly caused by choledocholithiasis, carcinoma of the head of the pancreas, biliary strictures, pancreatitis, and sclerosing cholangitis.7 Jaundice is a rare presentation of abdominal aneurysms due to obstruction to the biliary tree.7 CT or MRI confirms the diagnosis of aortic aneurysms.6 Intervention by surgery or
percutaneous technology is indicated when the size of the aneurysm reaches
a threshold where the risk for developing complications according to the natural history of the disease is significant.6,8

Case Presentation
A 37-year-old man who smokes but denies any previous medical illness was referred to Prince Sultan Cardiac Center complaining of worsening shortness of breath,

especially during exertion, abdominal swelling, and lower limb edema. He has no family history of connective tissue disorders. Upon examination, the patient looked tired, jaun­ diced, and unable to lie flat on the bed. The patient was afebrile. His heart rate was 113 beats per minute, his blood pressure was 101/70 mmHg, and he saturated 97% on room air. On chest auscultation, there was an audible diastolic murmur all over the chest. The abdominal exam was unre­ markable, and there was bilateral pitting edema up to the shaft of the leg. Laboratory investigations showed the fol­ lowing: hemoglobin of 13 g/dl, normal platelet count, ele­ vated liver enzymes with AST of 843 U/L (Normal: 0-32 U/ L), ALT 1766 U/L (Normal 0-41 U/L), total bilirubin of 290 umol/L (Normal: 0-21 umol/L), and direct bilirubin of 200 umol/L (Normal: 0-3.4 umol/L). Creatinine was also ele­ vated at 120 umol/L (Normal: 62-106 umol/L). The coagu­ lation profile was abnormal, with INR 2.15 sec., while cardiac enzymes were within normal. The patient's chest x-ray showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette (Figure 1). The abdominal ultrasound was normal. The patient had transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), which showed severely reduced ventricular function with an ejection frac­ tion of about 25%, dilated both ventricles, a bicuspid aortic valve with severe regurgitation, dilated inferior vena cava, congested liver, and an ascending aortic aneurysm with a maximum diameter of 6.9 cm (Figure 2). CT scan with contrast further delineated the aneurysm and its extension

Following an urgent heart team discus­ sion, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for close observation and started on intravenous inotropes to support his circulation and optimize his condition for sur­ gery. His blood pressure was maintained at less than 120 mmHg, and his heart rate was sustained to 55 beats per minute. The patient underwent a modified Bentall pro­ cedure in the second week of admission. The surgery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged home one week post-surgery. Tissue pathology showed degenerative changes only. The follow-up echo four weeks later

Discussion
An aneurysm can generally be defined as the enlarge­ ment of a blood vessel to more than 150% of the diameter expected for gender, age, and weight.4 Although the true prevalence of TAAs is unknown, it is estimated to have an incidence of at least 5-10 per 100,000 person-years.5,9 More than half of these aneur­ ysms are in the ascending aorta followed in frequency by the descending thoracic aorta. Less than 10% are confined to the aortic arch.5 Atherosclerosis along with its risk factors, connective tissue disease (eg, Marfan syndrome), and abnormalities of the aortic valve (eg, bicuspid aortic valve) are strongly associated with the development of ascending aortic aneurysms, but spora­ dic cases have also been reported.10,11
The majority of TAAs are asymptomatic, and identify­ ing a patient with them represents a true challenge to health care providers.4,5 TAA can be encountered during a routine radiological examination, as an acute presenta­ tion with dissection, as a part of screening the relative of a patient with a known aneurysm, or as a part of a known congenital cardiac defect.1 Frequently reported symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm include dyspnea, cough, dys­ phagia, hoarseness of voice, claudication, cerebrovascular events, as well as chest, abdominal, or back pain.11 Other

unusual presentations of thoracic aneurysms reported in the literature include erosion of the overlying skin and sternum, rupture into the esophagus, compression and invasion of the pulmonary artery, superior vena cava syndrome, and recurrent laryngeal and phrenic nerve palsy.12-15,17,18 The most common causes of jaundice are choledocholithiasis, biliary strictures, carcinoma of the head of the pancreas, pancreatitis, and sclerosing cholangitis.7 Jaundice has been reported in the literature as a rare presentation of abdominal aortic aneurysm (not TAAs) because of compression and obstruction of biliary ducts.16 Right ventricular failure may precipitate liver congestion, while congestion reduces hepatic blood flow, decreases arterial oxygen saturation, and increases hepatic venous pressure.19 Laboratory abnormalities include ele­ vated serum aminotransferase level to two to three times the upper limit of normal and hyperbilirubinemia.19 In our case, the patient developed biventricular failure, which resulted in hepatic congestion, and consequently, jaundice.
Unrecognized aneurysms risk rupture and dissection, which carry higher morbidity and mortality burden.18 To diagnose these aneurysms, the clinical history should be focused on the symptoms, risk factors, family history, and followed by detailed physical examination looking for signs of aneurysmal dilatation or its complications.11 Aortic imaging with echocardiography, computed tomo­ graphy angiography, and magnetic resonance angiogra­ phy remain the cornerstone to diagnose aortic aneurysms.11 Screening with transesophageal echocar­ diography is reasonable to evaluate the aorta in predis­ posed populations (eg, connective tissue disorders, bicuspid aortic valve, or screening first-degree relatives of patients with TAA). There is no recommendation for screening the general population.5 Blood pressure control is the cornerstone of nonsurgical management of small uncomplicated aneurysms.18 The significant determinants for intervention are the size of the aneurysm, rate of expansion, and associated conditions.11 Aneurysms are repaired when the risk of rupture exceeds the risk of repair.5
Conclusion
The presentation of TAAs can be obscured. Focused clin­ ical history, physical examination, and early implementa­ tion of diagnostic imaging aid in early recognition and management of aneurysms and avoid significant morbidity and mortality.

Abstract
AIM To explore the anti-tumor effects of esophageal cancerrelated gene 2 (ECRG2) in combination with cisplatin (DDP) in DDP-resistant esophageal cancer cells (EC9706/DDP).
METHODS A drug-resistant cell model was established, with EC9706/DDP cells being treated with ECRG2 and/ or DDP. Cell viability was examined by MTT assay. The rate of cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), metallothionein (MT), and p53 were determined by RT-PCR and PCNA, while MT and p53 protein expression levels were determined by western blotting.
RESULTS The anti-proliferative effect of ECRG2 in combination with DDP was superior when compared to ECRG2 or DDP alone. The inhibition rate for the combination reached its peak (51.33%) at 96 h. The early apoptotic rates of the control, ECRG2 alone, DDP alone, and ECRG2 plus DDP groups were 5.71% ± 0.27%, 12.68% ± 0.61%, 14.15% ± 0.87%, and 27.96% ±

0.36%, respectively. Although all treatment groups were significantly different from the control group (P < 0.05), the combination treatment of ECRG2 plus DDP performed significantly better when compared to either ECRG2 or DDP alone (P < 0.05). The combination of ECRG2 and DDP significantly upregulated p53 mRNA and protein levels and downregulated PCNA mRNA and protein levels compared to ECRG2 or DDP alone (P < 0.05). However, no changes were seen in the expression of MT mRNA or protein.
CONCLUSION ECRG2 in combination with DDP can inhibit viability and induce apoptosis in esophageal cancer DDP-resistant cells, possibly via upregulation of p53 expression and downregulation of PCNA expression. These findings suggest that the combination of ECRG2 and DDP may be a promising strategy for the clinical treatment of esophageal cancers that are resistant to DDP.

Core tip: Cisplatin (DDP) is one of the most effective agents in treating esophageal cancer, but drug resistance poses a major impediment. Combination therapy has become an important method for overcoming drug resistance. This study showed that esophageal cancer-related gene 2 (ECRG2) in combination with DDP can inhibit viability and induce apoptosis in DDP-resistant esophageal cancer cells, possibly via upregulation of p53 expression and downregulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression. These findings suggest that the combination of ECRG2 and DDP may be a promising strategy for the clinical treatment of esophageal cancers that are resistant to DDP.

INTRODUCTION
Esophageal cancer is a severe global health problem with an incidence that ranks eighth among all of the malignant cancers[1]. In spite of improvements in earlystage detection, most tumors are already at an advanced stage upon initial diagnosis[2]. Cisplatin (DDP)-based doublets have been the most commonly used treatment regimen for most patients with locally advanced or

metastatic esophageal cancer[3-6]. Unfortunately, DDP resistance and dose-limiting side effects have been a challenge to any further improvement of this treatment' s efficacy. These obstacles call for a novel combination of therapeutic approaches in order to achieve high therapeutic efficacy at a lower drug dose[7].
Esophageal cancer related gene 2 (ECRG2) was first separated and identified, using the mRNA technique of differential display, in normal esophageal tissues and esophageal cancer tissues in 1998[8]. It has been reported that ECRG2 inhibits tumor cell growth and promotes cell apoptosis in vivo and in vitro[9,10]. In our previous study, we found that ECRG2 combined with DDP had an enhanced inhibitory effect on EC9706 cell proliferation and an increased inductive effect on EC9706 cell apoptosis when compared to ECRG2 alone[11]. This suggests that ECRG2 may be involved in the drug resistance of esophageal cancer. There are currently no known studies in the literature examining the effects of ECRG2 on the drug resistance of esophageal cancer. In the present study, we established a drug-resistant cell model to explore the effects of ECRG2 on drug resistant cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
PCNA, p53, and MT primers and ECRG2 protein were manufactured by Sangon Biological Engineering Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). DDP was bought from Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Jinan, China). RPMI 1640 medium and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from HyClone (Logan, UT, United States). 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), TRIzol, and annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kits were purchased from Sigma Co. (St. Louis, MO, United States). The reverse transcription and amplification kits were purchased from Promega Co. (Madison, WI, United States). The rabbit antihuman PCNA and p53 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, United States). The rabbit anti-human MT and goat antirabbit IgG antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom). The human esophageal cancer cell line EC9706 was provided by the tumor cell library of the Academy of Medical Sciences in China.
Establishment of a drug-resistant cell line
We shocked EC9706 cells in the logarithmic phase with a final concentration of 2 mg/L of DDP. We discarded the culture solution after 48 h, washing 3 times with PBS. The cells were cultured in a fresh nutrient solution and washed every 2 d to remove dead cells. When the cells reached stable growth, we increased the DDP concentration, and repeated until the cells maintained growth in a medium with a concentration of 0.5 mg/L of DDP. The cells were cultured in a RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/m penicillin,

Figure 1 Survival rate of EC9706 and EC9706/cisplatin (DDP) cells treated with various concentrations of DDP. A dose-dependent association between the survival rate of EC9706 and EC9706/DDP cells and the concentration of DDP can be observed. The survival of EC9706 cells was significantly lower compared to EC9706/DDP cells following treatment with various concentrations of DDP. The IC50 of DDP in EC9706 cells is 3.34 ± 0.27 g/mL, while the IC50 of DDP in EC9706/DDP cells is 16.83 ±1.46 g/mL.

100 U/mL streptomycin, and 0.5 mL/L DDP in a humidified incubator at 37 with 5% CO2.
Cell viability
Drug sensitivity was analyzed by MTT assay. The cells were plated at 1 × 103 cells/mL in 96-well plates in a volume of 100 L and incubated for 24 h. The media were discarded and cells were treated with various concentrations of DDP or ECRG2 for 72 h. A total of 20 L of 5 g/L MTT solution was added to each well, with cells then being incubated for 4 h at 37. The medium was discarded and 150 L of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well, which was then shaken to completely dissolve the blue-purple precipitate from the MTT. A microplate reader was used to test the absorbance (OD) of each well at 490 nm and average values were obtained. Cell viability was calculated using the formula: (OD treated well-OD blank)/(OD control well-OD blank) × 100.
Cell apoptosis assay using annexin-V FITC/PI
The cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at a density of 4 × 105 cells per well. After overnight attachment, cells were treated with ECRG2 and/or DDP for 24 h. The cells were then harvested by trypsinization, washed with cold PBS, centrifuged at 1 × 103 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in 1 × binding buffer. 500 µL of each sample solution was then added to 5 µL of FITCconjugated annexin-V and 10 µL of PI, followed by incubation for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. The samples were then measured by flow cytometry.
RNA isolation and RT-PCR
Each group of cells was collected after 24 h of drug treatment. The total RNA was extracted from each group of cells using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was made via the protocol for the Reverse Transcription System for RT-

PCR. The primers for PCNA were 5'-ACCGCTGCGACC GCAATTTG-3'(forward) and 5'-ACGTGCAAATTCACC AGAAGGCATC-3'(reverse). The primers for MT were 5'-CGGATCCAGACTCAAACAGGCTTTTAT-3' (forward) and 5'-CGGATCCCGGAATGGACCCCAACTGCT-3' (reverse). The primers for p53 were 5'-ATTTGCGTGTG GAGTATTTGG-3' (forward) and 5'-GCTGTTCCGTCCCAGT AGATTA-3' (reverse). The primers for GAPDH were 5'-TCATGGGTGTGAACCATGAGAA-3' (forward) and 5'-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-3' (reverse). PCR amplification was performed using a kit under the following conditions: 95 for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles at 95 for 40 s, 55 for 40 s, and 72 for 1 min. The expression level of mRNA encoding the p53, PCNA, and MT genes were evaluated and normalized relative to that of GAPDH.
Western blot
The cells were collected from each group and lysed in 200 L of 1% Tween 20 in PBS by five cycles of freezing and thawing. The insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation. After quantification of the total protein, the protein was separated on 8% polyacrylamide gel (PAGE), and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore). The membranes were then blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS-Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with polyclonal rabbit anti-human MT, PCNA, or p53 antibody overnight at 4 at a 1:500 dilution, the membranes were incubated with a secondary HRPconjugated anti-rabbit antibody at a 1:1000 dilution and then washed again three times with PBST buffer. The transferred proteins were visualized using an ECL detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Statistical analysis
The SPSS 13.0 software system (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, United States) was used for statistical evaluation. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD for at least 3 independent experiments. Statistical significance was evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post hoc test. A P value of < 0.05 was considered to indi­ cate a statistically significant result.
RESULTS
Establishment of drug-resistant, EC9706/DDP cells
The EC9706/DDP cell line was established after several months of intermittent exposure by the parental cells to a gradually increasing concentration of drugs. After the EC9706 and EC9706/DDP cells were treated with DDP at various concentrations (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 g/mL) for 48 h, the cell viability rate was examined by MTT assay. As shown in Figure 1, the IC50 for 48 h of DDP in the EC9706/DDP cells was 16.83 ± 1.46 g/mL and the IC50 for 48 h of DDP in the parental EC9706 cells was 3.34 ± 0.27 g/mL. Therefore, the EC9706/DDP cells were five times more resistant to DDP compared to the parental cells.

Figure 3 Effects of esophageal cancer-related gene 2 combined with cisplatin (DDP) on cell viability in EC9706/DDP cells. Cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide, ECRG2 (6.5 g/mL) alone, DDP (3 g/mL) alone, or a combination of ECRG2 (6.5 g/mL) and DDP (3 g/mL) for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h. Cell viability was detected via MTT assay.

Effects of ECRG2 on the EC9706/DDP cells
To evaluate the effects of ECRG2 on the growth and viability of the cells, the EC9706/DDP cells were treated with various concentrations of ECRG2 (5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5 g/mL). The growth rate of the cells was found to be inhibited in a dose- and time- dependent manner by the ECRG2 protein (Figure 2).
Effects of combination treatment of ECRG2 and DDP on the EC9706/DDP cells
Based on the results above, we used 3 g/mL of DDP and 6.5 g/mL of ECRG2 for 48 h in EC9706/DDP cells for further experiments. As shown in Figure 3, the anti-proliferative effect of ECRG2 in combination with DDP was better compared to ECRG2 or DDP alone. These results suggest that a combination treatment of ECRG2 and DDP resulted in a synergistic decrease in cell viability compared to each treatment alone. The inhibition rate for the combination reached its peak (51.33%) at 96 h (Figure 3).

Figure 4 Effects of esophageal cancer-related gene 2 combined with cisplatin (DDP) on cell apoptosis in EC9706/DDP cells. Cells were treated with esophageal cancer-related gene 2 (ECRG2) (6.5 g/mL) alone, DDP (3 g/mL) alone, or a combination of ECRG2 and DDP for 24 h. Early apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using annexin V/PI staining. Annexin V was set as the horizontal axis and PI was set as the vertical axis. Mechanicallydamaged cells are located in the upper left quadrant, apoptotic or necrotic cells in the upper right quadrant, dual negative and normal cells in the lower left quadrant, and early apoptotic cells in the lower right quadrant of the flow cytometry dot plot. Data are shown as the mean ± SD. aP < 0.05 vs control group; cP < 0.05 ECRG2 +DDP vs DDP; eP < 0.05 ECRG2 + DDP vs ECRG2.

Effects of ECRG2 and DDP on apoptosis of the EC9706/ DDP cells
We next examined the effect of ECRG2 and DDP on cell apoptosis by performing annexin V/PI staining. The early apoptotic rates of the control, ECRG2 alone, DDP alone, and ECRG2 plus DDP groups were 5.71% ± 0.27%, 12.68% ± 0.61%, 14.15% ± 0.87%, and 27.96% ± 0.36%, respectively. Although all treatment groups were significantly different from the control group (P < 0.05), the combination treatment of ECRG2 plus DDP performed significantly better when compared to either ECRG2 or DDP alone (P < 0.05) (Figure 4).

DISCUSSION
DDP is one of the most effective anti-cancer agents widely used in the treatment of solid tumors, in­ cluding esophageal cancer. Despite a consistent rate of initial response, DDP treatment often results in the development of chemoresistance, leading to therapeutic failure. Combination therapy has become an important method of overcoming drug resistance. There have been many attempts to overcome DDP resistance in esophageal cancer cells. Lee et al[12] reported that the novel oxygen carrier YQ23 enhanced the DDP response of chemoresistant esophageal tumor xenografts, as well as reducing tumor size and the number of animals with invasive tumors. Lai et al[13] provided evidence that 14-3-3, or its related DNA repair molecule, is a promising therapeutic target for counteracting DDP resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, Yu et al[14] suggested

autophagy is a novel target to improve the efficiency of DDP in human esophageal cancers with acquired resistance.
In this study, we first established an EC9706/DDP cell line derived from in vitro treatment of sensitive cells as a model to examine the effect of ECRG2 on DDP resistance. The results demonstrated that a combination of ECRG2 and DDP had synergistic inhibitory effects on the proliferation of EC9706/DDP cells. The inhibition rate was significantly higher in EC9706/DDP cells treated with ECRG2 and DDP compared to cells treated with ECRG2 or DDP alone. This suggests ECRG2 may reduce or inhibit DDP resistance.
The mechanism through which cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy is associated with increased resistance to apoptosis. Agents that induce apoptosis have been reported to sensitize tumor cells to DDP[15]. Cui et al[9,10] reported that ECRG2 promoted cell apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Here, we provided experimental evidence showing the combination of ECRG2 and DDP promoted the apoptosis of esophageal DDP-resistant cancer cells. A study by Li et al[16] showed that ECRG2-overexpressing cells had a higher expression of p53. We therefore compared the p53 expression levels of the control, DDP alone, and ECRG2 plus DDP groups. Our results proved that p53 was involved in this process. The pivotal role of p53 pro-apoptotic function in sensitivity to DDP has also recently been reported[17,18]. The tumor suppressor protein p53 has been shown to mediate the cellular stress response, as well as initiate DNA repair, cell-cycle arrest, senescence, and, most notably, apoptosis. However, p53 can also induce DNA-damage, thereby further promoting cell death. Therefore, we believe the combination of ECRG2 and DDP induced overexpression of p53 and then increased the response to DDP by the p53 pro-apoptotic function in esophageal DDP-resistant cancer cells.
In addition to p53, there are other molecules involved in DDP resistance. Dillehay et al[19] reported a novel small molecule targeting PCNA-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, as well as enhancing DNA damage and apoptosis triggered by DDP in a p53-independent manner. Expression of PCNA genes in all organisms is traditionally associated with cell proliferation and thus with DNA synthesis during genome replication in the S phase of the cell cycle[20]. However, recent developments in PCNA protein interactions, trimer formation, and signaling regulation allow for the potential of possible therapeutic targeting of PCNA[21]. Both peptides and small molecules targeting PCNA signaling have been reported to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents[22,23]. A PCNA inhibitor can increase DNA double-strand breaks and cause the accumulation of DNA damage, which will eventually lead to cell death in cells that lack the ability to repair this damage[19]. In the present study, we demonstrated that the small

molecule ECRG2 combined with DDP reversed DDP resistance by downregulating PCNA expression in esophageal DDP-resistant cancer cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon require further future exploration.
MT is a low molecular weight protein that is rich in cysteine[24]. In recent years, the relationship between MT and tumors has received increasing attention, including the role of MT in tumor formation and the differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis of tumor cells and tumor tissue in ammonia chloride DDP chemotherapy drug resistance[25,26]. In vitro and in vivo studies show that overexpression of MT involved in DDP resistance, MT expression level, and DDP resistance level are related, with MT increasing DDP resistance[27,28]. However, another study demonstrated that the expression of MT was not related to resistance in DDP treatment[29-31]. In this present study, we found no significant change in the expression of MT after increasing DDP and ECRG2. ECRG2 in combination with DDP promotes cell apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation, but not by reducing the expression of MT.
In conclusion, we showed in the present study that ECRG2 in combination with DDP reduces or inhibits DDP resistance and induces cell apoptosis by upregulating p53 expression and downregulating PCNA expression, but not MT expression. Our results suggest that the combination of ECRG2 and DDP may be a promising strategy for the clinical treatment of esophageal cancers that are resistant to DDP. The effects of combined ECRG2 and DDP treatment on DDP-resistant cancer cells should be further investigated and confirmed in other human cancer cell lines, as well as animal models of cancers.

Background
Cisplatin (DDP) is one of the most effective agents in esophageal cancer, but drug resistance poses a major impediment. Combination therapy has become an important method of overcoming drug resistance. It has been reported that esophageal cancer-related gene 2 (ECRG2) inhibits tumor cell growth and promotes cell apoptosis. In our previous study, we found ECRG2, in combination with DDP, had an enhanced inhibitory effect on EC9706 cell proliferation and an increased inductive effect on EC9706 cell apoptosis. This suggests that ECRG2 may be involved in the drug resistance of esophageal cancer. Currently, there are no known studies in the literature examining the effects of ECRG2 on the drug resistance of esophageal cancer.
Research frontiers
Drug resistance and dose-limiting side effects have been a challenge to the further improvement of chemotherapy efficacy. These obstacles call for a novel combination of therapeutic approaches. Anticancer drugs may be combined with a broad spectrum of molecules such as small-molecule inhibitors, interfering RNA molecules, microRNA, oncolytic viruses, and naturally occurring substances. The ECRG2/DDP combination presents a very promising treatment approach.
Innovations and breakthroughs
This is the first known study to investigate the synergistic effect of ECRG2 in combination with DDP. In addition, the current study also explores the synergy mechanisms of ECRG2 and DDP in DDP-resistant esophageal cancer cells.

Applications
This study shows that ECRG2 in combination with DDP can inhibit viability and induce apoptosis in esophageal cancer DDP-resistant cells, possibly through upregulation of p53 expression and downregulation of PCNA expression. These findings suggest that the combination of ECRG2 and DDP may be a promising strategy for the clinical treatment of esophageal cancers that are resistant to DDP.
Peer-review
This is an interesting study about ECRG2 enhancing the anticancer effects of DDP in DDP-resistant esophageal cancer cells.

Abstract
To assess the added value of singlephoton emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) in patients with endstage renal failure (ESRF) or renal transplant recipients in whom focal infection was suspected. Gallium67 (Ga67) citrate scintigrams of 18 patients (10 in ESRF and eight with renal transplants) were reviewed. Sites of abnormal uptake seen on the whole body and SPECT were noted. A SPECT/CT was also reviewed to see if additional information could be obtained. Imaging results were compared with the final diagnosis. Overall, 14 out of 18 (78%) patients had a proven cause to explain symptoms while four patients did not have a final cause identified. Infection was proven in the final diagnosis in 12 out of 14 (86%) patients. Of the 10 patients with ESRF, six had confirmed infection with the Ga67 citrate study correctly identifying five out of six (83%) patients, and SPECT/CT providing additional information in four out of five (80%) patients. In the eight renal transplant recipients, six had a confirmed source of infection (all identified by the Ga67 citrate study). SPECT/CT provided additional information in two out of six (33%) patients. Ga67 citrate imaging had an overall sensitivity of 13/14 (93%), with one false negative. SPECT/ CT provided an additional contribution in eight out of 18 (44%) patients by better defining the location/extent of infection and differentiating the physiological from the pathological uptake.

Introduction
A major reason why patients with endstage renal failure (ESRF) have increased morbidity and mortality is infection.[13] Patients who have received a renal transplant are also susceptible to infection, primarily as a result of immunosuppression but also due to a shorter ureter predisposing to pyelonephritis.[46] Pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) is a particularly common scenario in this population. Conventional crosssectional imaging may

fail to localize the cause of the fever. A nuclear medicine department serving a hospital with an active renal and renal transplant services may thus be asked to perform imaging in patients with suspected infection and inflammation. In our institution, it has been the practice for many years to opt for gallium67 (Ga67) citrate scintigraphy as the technique of choice in this clinical scenario. Ga67 citrate is a sensitive but nonspecific imaging agent that not only identifies the sites of infection but also detects other causes of PUO such as posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) or other inflammatory diseases, e.g., sarcoidosis.[7,8] By 48 h postinjection, Ga67 citrate is not renally excreted and has no physiological uptake in noninflamed and noninfected kidneys. Consequently, it has potential advantages over Tc99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) labeled white blood cells (WBCs) and F18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for imaging possible infections in the renal tract.[9,10]

Nowosinska, et al.: Gallium-67 Citrate SPECT/CT in infection imaging of renal transplant/renal failure

The spatial resolution of Ga67 scintigraphy is poor due to the radionuclide having four photopeaks (93 keV, 185 keV, 288 keV, and 394 keV), all with relatively low abundance. The tracer is also taken up physiologically by various organs, i.e. at sites where there is no disease. Thus, variable uptake may be seen, e.g., in the colon and it can be difficult to identify the exact location of a site of abnormal uptake and determine whether the uptake is pathological or physiological.
The advent of high quality singlephoton emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) has been shown to improve both localization and specificity in orthopedic and oncological conditions.[1113] In infection, it has been shown that the use of SPECT/CT has resulted in an improved accuracy of reporting, although none of these studies have looked at those patients with a renal transplant or significant renal failure.[1416]
The aim of this study was to determine whether SPECT/CT could improve the accuracy and the localization of Ga67 imaging in our institution when compared with our previous standard of whole body imaging (WBI) and SPECT (without CT), which was until recently the standard of care in our institution for patients with suspected infection who had ESRF or were renal transplant recipients.
Patients and Methods
General
This study is a retrospective review looking at a consecutive series of patients referred to nuclear medicine to identify the possible sites of sepsis. All these patients had had multiple previous radiological investigations without a cause being identified.
Patient population
A total of 18 patients were referred for Ga67 citrate SPECT/ CT from the renal unit over a 14month period [Table 1]. There were 10 patients in Group A comprising patients with ESRF attending a predialysis clinic or who were already on dialysis. Three of these patients had suspected infection of adult polycystic kidney disease (APCKD); three had suspected bone infections; three had a persistently raised Creactive protein (CRP), the cause of which had not been elucidated from other investigations; and one patient had a suspected graft infection.
Group B comprised eight patients all of whom had received a renal transplant, which was functioning in six patients. In three of these patients, an infected graft was suspected (although in one of these patients, the clinicians were unsure if the site of infection was native or due to transplant). In the fourth patient, the site of infection was thought to be within a cyst in a native

Imaging protocol
Whole body Ga67 citrate scintigraphy was performed 48 h after injection of 150 MBq Ga67 citrate using a dualheaded, variableangle gammacamera (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) fitted with a mediumenergy collimator. The three main energy peaks of Ga67, such as 93 keV, 184 keV, and 300 keV, were chosen. Whole body images were acquired at 8 cm/min. After inspection of the whole body images by a trained nuclear medicine physician, a SPECT/CT was performed of the body region that was suspected to contain the site of infection, or which had been suspicious on WBI.

SPECT images were acquired in a 60step (20 s/stop), 360° noncircular orbit and reconstructed in a 128 × 128 matrix, using a threedimensional ordered subsets expectation maximization algorithm. Data were reconstructed iteratively using Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany with four subsets and eight iterations, and applying a Gaussian filter.

SPECT studies were viewed in the coronal, axial, and sagittal planes and in a reprojection.
A lowdose CT transmission scan was acquired after the SPECT study. The CT parameters used were a voltage of

130 kVp and an electric charge of 4065 mAs (40 mAs for the thorax and 65 mAs for the abdomen) modulated with a "dosecare package." The CT was reconstructed using a 512 × 512 matrix at a slice thickness of 5 mm. Transmission data were registered with the emission data using the Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany. CT correction for attenuation was applied to the SPECT images.
Matching pairs of X-ray transmission and nuclear medicine emission images were fused using the Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany, and hybrid images of overlying transmission (CT) and emission (SPECT) data were generated.
In total, 34 regions (16 abdominal, 15 pelvic, and three chest) were evaluated. The SPECT/CT images were also visually inspected to exclude any misregistration using the reference landmarks. No misalignment was identified in the SPECT/CT studies of the 18 patients.
Interpretation criteria
Because many of these patients were frequent attenders at the department of nuclear medicine for multiple scintigraphic tests, a truly "blind" read of the results could not be achieved as these patients were wellknown to all the staff. Therefore, readings by two experienced nuclear medicine specialists were performed in a clinical scenario and they were aware of the patients' clinical history and the results of previously performed conventional imaging tests before they reviewed the scintigraphic data, including the planar and the SPECT images, recording any sites of suspected pathology. After the results of the planar and the SPECT images had been recorded, the SPECT/CT images were subsequently evaluated and interpreted in the same manner. Any focus of increased uptake not related to normal physiologic biodistribution of radiopharmaceutical in the suspicious region was considered to represent pathology. Any disagreements on the interpretation were settled by a consensual agreement between the two specialists.
SPECT/CT was considered contributory when it provided data that could not be obtained from the assessment of the planar and the SPECT images alone concerning the presence of pathology or its precise location. The results were then compared with the final diagnosis, which was derived from the microbiological findings (n = 11), histology (n = 1), and/ or correlative imaging data (n = 14).
Results
Patients with renal failure/on dialysis (Group A)
In the 10 patients with severe renal impairment (Group A), infection was confirmed in six (60%) patients [Table 2]. In

five out of six (83%) patients, the whole body and SPECT study identified the site of infection correctly. In one out of six (17%) patients (patient 7), the final diagnosis of discitis was not identified on the Ga67 study. In four out of five (80%) patients (patients 2, 3, 6, and 10), SPECT/CT was able to localize and define the extent of infection more precisely than the planar and the SPECT alone. Of the remaining four patients, no infection was found in three patients (patients 1, 4, 8), with SPECT/CT adding value in one patient, confirming the focal uptake on conventional scintigraphy to be physiological (patient 1). The last patient (patient 5) had inflammatory disease identified.
Patients with transplants (Group B)
There were six (75%) confirmed infections in the eight patients with renal transplants that were imaged. All the six patients were diagnosed using the Ga67 citrate scan. SPECT/CT provided additional information for two out of six (33%) patients (patients 15 and 17). In patient 15, the uptake was confirmed to localize to a soft tissue collection (and not bowel uptake) while in patient 17, the extent of infection was better defined on SPECT/CT.
One of the remaining patients had myositis (which was seen equally well with conventional scintigraphy and SPECT/CT). The last remaining patient had PTLD, and SPECT/CT helped raise the suspicion of this diagnosis as lymph node uptake was not identified on the whole body or SPECT alone.
Summary
Of the 18 patients imaged, 14 (78%) had a proven cause to explain the symptoms while four patients did not have a final cause identified. Infection was proven as the final diagnosis in 12 out of 14 (86%) patients. Ga67 imaging had an overall sensitivity of 13/14 (93%), with one false negative. SPECT/CT provided an additional contribution in eight out of 18 (44%) patients by better defining the location/extent of infection and differentiating the physiological from the pathological uptake.
Discussion
The results of this retrospective study show that SPECT/CT can improve the accuracy of Ga67 citrate imaging in this patient group. In our study, like that of others reported in the literature, the main improvement is of specificity.[1016] The site of tracer uptake could more accurately be defined [Figures 1 and 2]. In addition, a contemporaneous CT (albeit noncontrast and of reduced mAs) may enable a diagnosis to be established even if there is no Ga67 uptake at that site.[14,15]
This study demonstrated that SPECT/CT contributed additional information that was clinically useful in over 40% of the patients imaged. This additional

information may justify the additional radiation burden of 12 mSv in these patients attributed to the use of CT. The additional financial cost of SPECT/CT versus SPECT alone may also be justified if a diagnosis is reached more promptly.

Despite these patients being recognized as a clinically challenging group, the results of this study are similar to that obtained in other studies looking at different patient groups. For example, in 82 patients with a mixture of soft tissue and bone infections imaged with In111 leukocytes or Ga67 citrate, additional information was found in 48% of patients by the additional use of SPECT/CT.[17] In a group of 28 patients with orthopedic infections imaged with Tc99m HMPAOlabeled WBCs, SPECT/CT produced an improved accuracy of reporting in 36% of patients.[16] In addition, there are case reports that show the utility of Ga67 citrate SPECT/CT in suspected adult with infected polycystic kidneys and perirenal transplant infections.[810]

An alternative method would be to use F18 FDG positron emission tomographyCT (PETCT). A series of studies has shown that this modality can be accurate in patients with a wide range of infections including PUO.[1821] While there are no studies in the same patient groups like that of our study [chronic renal failure (CRF) and postrenal transplant], the incidence of infection lying

within the renal tract itself was high (29%). Using F18 FDG PETCT, the route of tracer elimination (i.e. renal) can lead to difficulties in the interpretation of the images, as the pathological tracer uptake is much more difficult to distinguish than the physiological. In a few reports, there has been limited evidence that F18 FDG PET may still be useful in the infected renal cyst.[22,23] In addition, the

use of F18 FDG for infection imaging is not universally funded or reimbursed.
Therefore, it would appear from this retrospective review that SPECT/CT in Ga67 citrate imaging may have a role in imaging infection in patients with advanced renal disease, on dialysis or having received a renal transplant. Further work needs to be done to determine if SPECT/CT can be combined with other single photon imaging agents such as radiolabeled leukocytes.

Leptin: A Novel Hormone of the Parathyroid Gland. Don Hoang.
Purpose: To investigate the expression and exogenous effect of leptin hormone in diseased parathyroid glands at a basic science and clinical level.
Introduction: Hyperparathyroidism (HPTH) is a common endocrine problem affecting 1 in 500 individuals who are typically female and over the age of 60. Combined effects of low calcium and vitamin D stimulating parathyroid activity and excess PTH secretion are well established, especially in secondary HPTH. Unclear is the mechanism behind the development of hyper secreting parathyroid adenomas, responsible for nearly 90 percent of primary HPTH. Discovered in 1994 as a class I cytokine receptor, leptin has mounted considerable interest as a mitogenic factor involved in the stimulation and growth of tumors. Also, leptin has been implicated in multiple calcium-related metabolic processes, which have led to numerous evaluations of the connections between vitamin-D, PTH, and obesity. Ultimately, these scientific findings, the prevalence of higher leptin levels in women with HPTH, and our hypothesis that leptin found with increased body weight contributes to the pathogenesis of HPTH has led to our study on endogenous leptin production and its exogenous effect in diseased parathyroid glands. Furthermore, with routine serum calcium screening now, many patients are treated with minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) before hypercalcemic sequelae develop; we also wished to clarify the clinical relationship between PTH, leptin, and BMI in a cohort of patients with HPTH undergoing surgery.
Methods: We enrolled 96 patients with HPTH undergoing MIPs in a prospective study to collect tissue and co-localize leptin hormone and PTH by in situ hybridization (ISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), and electronmicroscopy (EM). Cell culture and whole organ explant experiments in which surgically removed human parathyroid tissue were exposed to recombinant human leptin to functionally characterize the effect of leptin on PTH secretion. Parathyroid adenomas and hyperplasia were xenografted into nude rats and evaluated for the production of human leptin. Blood was also collected to assess subsequent perioperative changes to serum leptin levels. Patients without HPTH undergoing hemithyroidectomies under identical surgical conditions were enrolled as control subjects. Wilcoxon signed-rank test, non-parametric version of paired t-test, and Pearson correlation were used to compare leptin level changes with different clinical variables using SAS 9.2.
Results: Leptin, leptin receptor, and PTH mRNA transcripts and protein were detected in an overlapping fashion in secretory (chief) cells in parathyroid hyperplasia and adenoma samples by ISH, IHC, IF, and EM studies. Immunofluorescence studies under spinning disc confocal microscopy and electron microscopy imaging confirm co-localization of endogenous leptin and PTH as well as active exogenous leptin uptake in cultured parathyroid cells. Tissue explant experiments show that PTH-secretion responds to recombinant leptin exposure in a dose dependent manner. Nude rats had positive human leptin at 2, 4, and 8 weeks in increasing trend for adenoma and decreasing trend for hyperplasia xenografts. Our study subjects included 71 (76 percent) adenoma, 13 (14 percent) hyperplasia, and 12 (13 percent) control patients. The median age was 59 years old, of whom 76 percent were females. This population was overweight (median BMI: 28) and pre-hypertensive (median SBP:131). Comparing measurements pre and post surgery, BOTH serum leptin and PTH levels decrease significantly in the whole cohort (p<0.001). Leptin decreases significantly

in adenoma (p<0.001) and hyperplasia subgroups (p=0.002); it increases in controls (p=0.007). Leptin decrease was significantly associated with a decrease in PTH pre-post surgery (r=0.32, p=0.003) (r=0.55, p<0.001 for adenoma subgroup). Bivariate analysis revealed several variables associated with changes in perioperative leptin and PTH levels. In multivariate analysis, parathyroid disease subtype, starting leptin levels, age, BMI, and calcium at diagnosis were significantly associated with changes in leptin.
Conclusion: Our results provide interesting insight and implications into the relationship between leptin, obesity, and primary hyperparathyroidism (adenomas) as there is no previous research data elucidating the direct relationship between leptin, PTH, and the parathyroid gland. Our results provide very strong evidence of a new functional and physiologically relevant parathyroid hormone. Until now, no previous research data identified the presence of leptin hormone in parathyroid glands; it remains unclear as to whether high exogenous leptin levels initiate hyperparathyroid disease, possibly acting mitogenically on parathyroid leptin receptors, or whether hyperparathyroid glands and elevated PTH serum levels precede elevated leptin production, either by endogenous parathyroid production or through downstream endocrine signaling of adipose tissue production. Based on our results and published reports, future studies will test our hypothesis that leptin play a central tumorigenic role in the etiology of parathyroid neoplasms.

Glulisine Versus Human Regular Insulin in Combination With Glargine in Noncritically Ill Hospitalized Patients With Type 2 Diabetes
A randomized double-blind study

CHRISTIAN MEYER, MD ANNA BORON, MD ELENA PLUMMER, MD

MARINA VOLTCHENOK, MD ROSEMARIE VEDDA, PA

OBJECTIVE -- To compare the efficacy and safety of the rapid-acting insulin analog glulisine and regular insulin in hyperglycemic hospitalized patients.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- A total of 180 hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes received either glulisine (n  88) or regular insulin (n  92) before each meal in combination with insulin glargine at bedtime in a randomized double-blind fashion. All previous diabetes medications were discontinued if applicable. Doses of insulin were adjusted to obtain target blood glucose concentrations of 130 mg/dl before meals and at bedtime while avoiding hypoglycemia.
RESULTS -- Overall mean blood glucose concentrations were 8 mg/dl lower in the glulisine group than in the regular insulin group (152.6  66.6 vs. 160.4  70.8 mg/dl; P  0.0002). This improvement was wholly due to 22 mg/dl lower levels after 4 days of therapy (140  55 vs. 162  71 mg/dl; P  0.0007); after day 4, this difference progressively increased such that mean blood glucose concentrations from day 7 onward were 31 mg/dl lower in the glulisine group. The mean daily incidence of hypoglycemia was slightly but not significantly lower in the glulisine than the regular insulin group (0.10  0.02 vs. 0.14  0.03 episode/day; P  0.35).
CONCLUSIONS -- In hospitalized type 2 diabetic patients, glulisine may provide better glycemic control than regular insulin, especially in those who have a prolonged length of stay.
Diabetes Care 33:2496-2501, 2010

A ccumulating evidence suggests that hyperglycemia is associated with an increased risk of complications and mortality in hospitalized patients. In critically ill patients, improved glycemic control reduces short- and long-term mortality, rates of multiorgan failure, systemic infections, and length of hospitalization (1-3). Likewise, in patients admitted to general medical and surgical areas hyperglycemia is associated with a

prolonged hospital stay, infection, disability, and death (4 - 6), suggesting that poor glycemic control is associated with poor clinical outcome.
Insulin is the most effective and the most preferred agent for the treatment of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients (7). However, inpatient insulin therapy is often complicated by variable meal delivery, unpredictable food consumption, and medical conditions, including liver

and kidney disease, that predispose to hypoglycemia. Rapid-acting insulin analogs, which have been shown to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in the outpatient setting (8), may hence be a better choice than regular insulin for the treatment of hyperglycemia in noncritically ill hospitalized patients. The present study was therefore undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of the rapid-acting insulin analog glulisine and regular insulin in hyperglycemic hospitalized patients.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We enrolled 194 patients with type 2 diabetes who were admitted to a noncritical care medical or surgical unit at the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center (Phoenix, AZ). All patients were expected to stay hospitalized 3 days. Exclusion criteria included severe hypoglycemia within the past 6 months or hypoglycemia unawareness because of the known risk reduction of hypoglycemia using rapid-acting insulin analogs (9,10), prolonged nothing by mouth status, continuous nutrition (total parenteral nutrition or enteral nutrition), and mental health conditions rendering the patient unable to provide informed written consent. Informed written consent was obtained from all patients after the study had been approved by the local institutional review board.
All prior diabetes medications were discontinued if applicable, and all patients were started on a basal-bolus insulin regimen consisting of insulin glargine (Lantus; sanofi-aventis, Bridgewater, NJ) and glulisine (Apidra; sanofi-aventis, Bridgewater, NJ) or regular insulin (Novolin R, Novo Nordisk, Princeton, NJ). Patients were assigned to receive glulisine or regular insulin in a randomized double-blind fashion. For patients treated only with insulin before the hospitalization, the initial dose of insulin was equal to the total outpatient dose. For all other patients, the initial total daily dose of in-

One-half of the total daily insulin dose was given as glargine once daily at bedtime, and the other half was given as glulisine or regular insulin in equally divided doses before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. All insulin doses were administered by nurses, who were not blinded to the study medications. Glulisine was administered immediately before meals, regular insulin was administered 30 min before meals. Glulisine and regular insulin were not given if a subject was unable to eat to avoid hypoglycemia. Fingerstick blood glucose (FSBG) was tested daily before each meal, at bedtime, and whenever subjects reported symptoms of hypoglycemia; 2-h postprandial and 2:00 A.M. FSBG were tested every 3rd day starting on day 2 of study participation. All FSBG measurements were obtained using the Roche Accu-Chek Inform glucose meter (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and downloaded to the VA Computerized Patient Record System. Insulin doses were adjusted daily by the investigators (who were blinded to the short-acting insulin) to target blood glucose concentrations of 130 mg/dl before meals and at bedtime while avoiding hypoglycemia using the following guidance: for fasting blood glucose concentrations of 130 -160, 161- 200, and 200 mg/dl, increase glargine by 10, 20, and 30%, respectively; for prelunch, predinner, and bedtime blood glucose concentrations of 130 -160, 161- 200, and 200 mg/dl, increase regular insulin or glulisine at the prior meal by 10, 20, and 30%, respectively. Supplemental glulisine or regular insulin was given in addition to the scheduled insulin dose before each meal for blood glucose concentrations 130 mg/dl according to a sliding scale protocol (Table 1).

creatinine, white blood cell count, and A1C were measured on the 1st day of hospitalization. Fasting plasma C-peptide with the concurrent plasma glucose concentration was measured on day 1 of study participation. All measurements were performed by the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center central laboratory using standard assays.
Hypoglycemia was defined as a blood glucose concentration 60 mg/dl. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event that required assistance from another person for recovery. Nocturnal hypoglycemia was defined as an event that occurred between the injection of glargine at bedtime and before the subject awoke in the morning. As an index of -cell function, homeostasis model assessment of percent -cell function (HOMA-%B) was calculated as [fasting plasma insulin [picomoles per liter]  3.33/(fasting plasma glucose [millimoles per liter] - 3.5)] (11).
The primary end points were glycemic control, measured by the mean daily blood glucose concentration, and the incidence of hypoglycemia. Length of stay was the secondary end point. Sample sizes were calculated for 80% power at an  of 0.05 for both primary end points. We assumed an average length of stay of 7 days, a within-group SD of 45 mg/dl in mean daily blood glucose concentrations, and a 30% incidence of subjects experiencing at least one episode of hypoglycemia as found in a previous similar study (12). Under these assumptions, power calculations indicated the need for 80 subjects to detect a 10 mg/dl difference in mean daily blood glucose concentrations and the need for 565 subjects to detect a 25% difference in the incidence of hypoglycemia. However, before reaching the latter sample size, at 194 subjects, the decision was made to terminate the study because of slower than expected enrollment. Baseline characteristics of subjects

and outcome variables were compared using the Student t test or the 2 test as appropriate. Multiple comparisons of blood glucose concentrations over the course of the subjects' study participation were performed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). P  0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are presented as means  SD unless otherwise indicated.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics Of the 194 enrolled subjects, 96 were randomly assigned to glulisine and 98 were randomly assigned to regular insulin. Fourteen subjects dropped out for personal nonmedical reasons before receiving any insulin as part of this study: 8 subjects assigned to glulisine and 6 subjects assigned to regular insulin. Therefore, data from 88 subjects in the glulisine group and 92 subjects in the regular insulin group were used for statistical analyses. As shown in Table 2, both groups were well matched for age, sex, BMI, previously unrecognized type 2 diabetes, and prior history of type 2 diabetes, diabetes duration, prior diabetes treatment, blood glucose concentration on admission, A1C, -cell function, renal function, and white blood cell count. The most common admitting diagnoses were cardiovascular disease, infection, and pulmonary disease (Table 2). The length of time of hospitalization was not significantly different between the glulisine and the regular insulin group (7.3  0.5 vs. 8.4  0.6 days; P  0.13).
Insulin doses In the glulisine and the regular insulin group, the mean total daily dose of insulin was similar (69  33 vs. 71  45 units; NS) and was accounted for by a comparable amount of short-acting insulin (36  18 vs. 38  24 units; NS).
Glycemic control During the entire period of the subjects' study participation, mean blood glucose concentrations were 8 mg/dl lower in the glulisine group than in the regular insulin group (152.6  66.6 vs. 160.4  70.8 mg/dl; P  0.0002). This reduction was wholly due to the on average 22 mg/dl lower blood glucose concentrations after 4 days of therapy (140  55 vs. 162  71 mg/dl; P  0.0007), because

concentrations (138  51 vs. 162  72 mg/dl; P  0.000002) and 2-h postprandial blood glucose concentrations (164  70 vs. 191  71 mg/dl; P  0.0026) were significantly lower in the glulisine group than in the regular insulin group whereas fasting (125  49 vs. 141  54 mg/dl; P  0.06) and 2:00 A.M. blood glucose concentrations (150  52 vs. 160  67 mg/dl; P  0.8) were not significantly different.
Subgroup analysis To examine whether the improved glycemia with glulisine past day 4 could potentially be explained by different characteristics of subjects who stayed hospitalized for a longer period of time, we compared subjects participating 4 days (n  39 in the glulisine group; n  54 in the regular insulin group) with subjects participating 4 days in separate analyses. Age, sex, BMI, A1C, HOMA%B, diabetes duration, and admission diagnosis were comparable between these subgroups in both the glulisine group and the regular insulin group (all P  0.3). Moreover, in subjects who participated 4 days, glycemic control was similar in the glulisine and the regular insulin group during the first 4 days of study participation (P  0.9) as found when we analyzed data for all subjects.

levels were virtually identical in both groups during the first 4 days (159  71 vs. 159  71 mg/dl; P  0.9). After day 4, the target blood glucose level of 130 mg/dl before meals was achieved in 48% of subjects in the glulisine group and in 38% of subjects in the regular insulin group (P  0.0003); 66% of all blood glucose readings in the glulisine group were 90 -180 mg/dl compared with 54% in the regular insulin group (P  0.0001). The difference in glycemic control between both groups progressively increased such that blood glucose concentrations from 7 day onward were 31 mg/dl lower in the glulisine group (133  51 vs. 164  72 mg/dl; P  0.0001). The time course of mean daily blood glucose concentrations (premeal and bedtime blood glucose concentrations) in both groups of subjects is shown in Fig. 1A.
To examine whether the reduction in glycemia by glulisine could have been due to its direct actions, we separately analyzed blood glucose concentrations that were expected to be predominantly determined by the actions of glargine (e.g.,

fasting and 2:00 A.M. blood glucose concentrations) and blood glucose concentrations that were expected to be predominantly determined by the actions of glulisine or regular human insulin (e.g., prelunch, predinner, and bedtime blood glucose concentrations, corresponding to 4-h postprandial levels and 2-h postprandial blood glucose concentrations). When all blood glucose concentrations throughout the study are used for analysis, means of prelunch, predinner, and bedtime blood glucose concentrations (152  64 vs. 162  70 mg/dl; P  0.0003) and 2-h postprandial blood glucose concentrations (177  79 vs. 191  77 mg/dl; P  0.03) were significantly lower in the glulisine group than in the regular insulin group. In contrast, fasting (141  59 vs. 140  57 mg/dl) and 2:00 A.M. blood glucose concentrations (149  67 vs. 150  67 mg/dl) were virtually identical in both groups (both P  0.7) (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained when only blood glucose concentrations past day 4 were examined. Prelunch, predinner, and bedtime blood glucose

Hypoglycemia Throughout the study, there were 123 hypoglycemic events: 56 in the glulisine group and 67 in the regular insulin group. However, neither the number of subjects with one or more hypoglycemic episodes (30 vs. 35%; P  0.5) nor the average daily incidence of hypoglycemia was significantly different (0.10  0.02 vs. 0.14  0.03 episode/day; P  0.35). Furthermore, the incidence of hypoglycemia was not significantly different between both groups during the first 4 days of therapy (0.11  0.03 vs. 0.14  0.03 episode/day; P  0.4), during which glycemia was comparable, and after day 4 (0.07  0.02 vs. 0.06  0.02 episode/ day; P  0.6), during which glycemia was significantly reduced in the glulisine group. The severity and the time of day of hypoglycemic events were also similar in both groups (Table 3). Only one hypoglycemic event, which occurred in the regular insulin group, was severe.
CONCLUSIONS -- In hospitalized patients, hyperglycemia is a frequent, serious, and costly problem, and tight

glycemic control is recommended by the American Diabetes Association (7). The present trial is the first to compare the ef-

ficacy and safety of the rapid-acting insulin analog glulisine and regular insulin in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.

Using a randomized double-blind study design, we found that treatment with glulisine resulted in lower blood glucose concentrations than treatment with regular insulin without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. When all blood glucose readings during the study are considered, the reduction in glycemia by glulisine was 8 mg/dl. This reduction was highly significant but arguably modest. However, if only data past day 4 of therapy are considered, glulisine resulted in 22 mg/dl reduced blood glucose concentrations, because both groups had similar levels during the first 4 days. Thereafter, the dif-

ference in glycemic control progressively increased such that after 7 days blood glucose concentrations were 31 mg/dl lower in the glulisine group.
It is of note that subjects participating for 4 days did not differ from those participating for 4 days in demographic, physical, and medical characteristics and that glycemic control was similar in the glulisine and the regular insulin group during their first 4 days of study participation as we had found when we analyzed data for all subjects. Furthermore, the incidence of hypoglycemia was, if anything, slightly higher in the regular insulin group than in the glulisine group. These findings suggest that the improvement in glycemic control by glulisine after but not during the first 4 days of therapy was due to the length of time required for dose titration and not due to unique characteristics of subjects who were hospitalized for a longer period of time. Moreover, they denote that insulin was titrated at least equally aggressively in the regular insulin group as in the glulisine group by the blinded investigators, suggesting that development of hypoglycemia prevented further up-titration of regular insulin and achievement of glycemic control similar to that in the glulisine group and that, for a given aggressiveness in dose titration with similar frequency of hypoglycemia, glulisine may provide better glycemic control than regular insulin in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.
The results of the present study are very much consistent with those of Dailey et al. (8) in that twice-daily glulisine in combination with NPH insulin improves glycemic control without increasing the frequency of hypoglycemia in outpatient type 2 diabetic patients. In contrast, our results disagree somewhat with those of Umpierrez et al. (12) in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes. In this study, the insulin analogs detemir given once daily and aspart given before meals resulted in glycemic control and frequency of hypoglycemia similar to that with a split-mixed regimen with NPH and regular insulin despite use of a dose titration schedule similar to that in the present study. However, contrary to our study, subjects were younger and were excluded for clinically relevant liver and kidney disease, suggesting that differences in study populations, specifically the risk of hypoglycemia, may be an explanation for the differing results.
In the present study both groups of subjects were well matched for age, dia-

betes duration, prior diabetes treatment, prior glycemic control, -cell function, renal function, and white blood cell count. Furthermore, the study personnel, making adjustments to the insulin doses, was blinded to the short-acting insulin. Only nurses, who administered the insulin, were unblinded to the types of shortacting insulin because of the different administration times in relation to meals. Therefore, differences in subjects' characteristics between the glulisine and regular insulin groups or bias of the investigators is an unlikely explanation of our results. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the following limitations of our study. First, it was performed in a single center in an elderly veteran population involving nearly exclusively males. Thus, whether the results can be generalized to other hospital settings and populations needs to be examined. Second, only individuals highly trained in insulin treatment made adjustments in insulin doses, and blood glucose levels were carefully reviewed at least once a day, exceeding the usual standard of care. Therefore, whether treatment with glulisine provides superior control compared with regular insulin in hospitalized patients in the hands of less well-trained providers and with less careful blood glucose monitoring may need to be tested. Third, it is possible that some of our study patients were not completely blinded regarding the type of mealtime insulin because of their knowledge of the different administration times of regular insulin and glulisine relative to meals. And fourth, we unfortunately did not achieve our estimated sample size needed for detecting differences in the incidence of hypoglycemia because of slower than expected patient recruitment.
In critically ill patients, hypoglycemia has been found to be associated with poor clinical outcome (13). Although the causality of hypoglycemia leading to poor clinical outcome has been questioned (14), hypoglycemia or the fear of it in health care providers and patients is undoubtedly the major barrier for the control of glycemia. In the present study, 30 - 35% of patients experienced at least one episode of hypoglycemia with an incidence of 0.1- 0.14 episode/day, comparable to the rates of hypoglycemia in the previous similar study by Umpierrez et al. (12). This observation demonstrates the difficulty of achieving tight glycemic control and underscores the importance of improving our treatment modalities in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.

In summary, the present study provides evidence suggesting that treatment with glulisine can provide superior glycemic control compared with regular insulin in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes, especially in those who have a prolonged length of stay. Further studies are needed to examine whether these results can be generalized to other populations and hospital settings, and whether the benefits of glulisine persevere with the usual standard of care for glycemic control.

Runder Tisch zur "Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf im Gesundheitswesen"

Annette Widmann-Mauz1
1 Deutscher Bundestag, Bundesministerium für Gesundheit, Parlamentarische Staatssekretärin, Berlin, Deutschland

Hintergrund
Es ist eine der zentralen gesundheitspolitischen Aufgaben, für eine flächendeckende und bedarfsgerechte medizinische Versorgung der Bevölkerung zu sorgen. Hierfür ist auf allen Ebenen qualifiziertes und motiviertes Personal unabdingbar. Schon heute wird beklagt, dass nicht mehr in allen Bereichen und Regionen genügend medizinisches und pflegerisches Personal zur Verfügung steht. Diese Situation wird sich in den nächsten Jahren insbesondere durch die demografische Entwicklung weiter verschärfen, denn die Menschen in unserem Land werden immer älter und ältere Menschen nutzen vermehrt medizinische Leistungen. Studien sehen deshalb künftig eine steigende Nachfrage nach medizinischen Leistungen - bei einer gleichzeitigen Abnahme an qualifizierten Fachkräften im ärztlichen und pflegerischen Bereich [1]. Ein wichtiger Faktor, um den notwendigen medizinischen und pflegerischen Nachwuchs für das Gesundheitswesen zu gewinnen und die hier Beschäftigten langfristig an ihre Arbeitsplätze zu binden, ist eine ausgewogene Work-LifeBalance der Beschäftigten. Die Verbesserung der Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf ist daher bei allen Berufsgruppen im Gesundheitswesen von zunehmender Bedeutung. Auch im Bundesministerium für Gesundheit (BMG) wird gemeinsam mit allen Beteiligten nach Lösungen gesucht. Ziel ist es konkrete Maßnahmen und Ideen zu erarbeiten, um bessere Angebote für die im Gesundheitswesen tätigen Menschen zu ermöglichen [2].
Runder Tisch
,,Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf im Gesundheitswesen"
Unter meiner Leitung wurde 2010 zwei Mal bei einem Runden Tisch zur ,,Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf im Gesundheitswesen" über die Problematik der besseren

Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf diskutiert. Teilgenommen haben Vertreter der Krankenhäuser, der Ärzteschaft einschließlich des Ärztinnenbundes, der Pflegenden und der Pflegeeinrichtungen, der Gewerkschaften, der Länder und des Spitzenverbandes Bund der Krankenkassen. Dabei haben alle Beteiligten die Notwendigkeit und Dringlichkeit der Schaffung familienfreundlicher Rahmenbedingungen im Gesundheitswesen erkannt. Im Dezember 2010 konnten erste gemeinsame Empfehlungen der Teilnehmenden zur besseren Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie im Gesundheitswesen formuliert werden. So sollen Hemmnisse in der Aus- und Weiterbildung von Berufen beseitigt, gezielte Informationen über gute Initiativen im Krankenhaus und der Arztpraxis bereitgestellt werden.
Aus- und Weiterbildung
Die Teilnehmenden waren sich einig, dass alle Möglichkeiten ausgeschöpft werden sollten, die Durchführung des Studiums in Vollzeit zu erleichtern. Aber auch eine stärkere Flexibilisierung der praktischen Studienanteile wurde als notwendig bewertet. Daher prüft das BMG derzeit, ob und inwieweit Änderungen der Ausbildungsregelungen erforderlich sind. Die Länder sollen überprüfen, ob die Ausbildungsordnungen angepasst werden müssen. Krankenhausträger, Universitäten und Universitätskliniken wurden aufgefordert, Modelle der guten Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf einschließlich eines besseren Angebots einer Ausbildung in Teilzeit zu entwickeln. Schon heute lassen die Weiterbildungsordnungen der Ärztekammern die Möglichkeit einer Weiterbildung in Teilzeit ausdrücklich zu, jedoch wird davon bislang nur in geringem Umfang Gebrauch gemacht. Die Bundesärztekammer und die Ärztekammern sollen darauf hinwirken, dass diese Möglichkeiten besser ausgeschöpft werden. Die Landesärztekammern sollen ihre Weiterbildungsregelungen vereinheitlichen, damit bei Wechsel des Landes

keine Anerkennungsprobleme auftreten. In den Kammerbezirken, Krankenhäusern und Praxen müssten die Voraussetzungen geschaffen werden, vermehrt Weiterbildung in Teilzeit absolvieren zu können: Dazu gehören insbesondere Weiterbildungsstrukturen, Ausbau von Verbundweiterbildung und Personalentwicklungsmaßnahmen, die die Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie fördern. In den Gesundheitsfachberufen ist die Weiterbildung unterschiedlich ausgestaltet. Soweit die Weiterbildung im Beruf erfolgt, unterscheiden sich die Weiterbildungsregelungen in den Ländern und sehen nur in einigen Ländern die Möglichkeit der Teilzeit vor. Dafür sollten die Länder ihre Weiterbildungsregelungen vereinheitlichen und Teilzeitmodelle vorsehen. Insbesondere soll die Anerkennung beim Wechsel des Landes erleichtert werden. Der Schutz werdender und stillender Mütter ist von hoher Bedeutung. Mutterschutzregelungen dürfen jedoch die Aus- und Weiterbildung nicht unangemessen behindern. Das BMG hat daher das Anliegen des Runden Tisches, die Mutterschutzregelungen zu überprüfen und ggf. zu überarbeiten, an das zuständige Bundesministerium für Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend herangetragen und gebeten, eine Bund-Länder-Arbeitsgruppe einzurichten.
Bundesmantelverträge und Zulassungsverordnungen
Zusätzlich werden die Partner der Bundesmantelverträge aufgrund der Empfehlungen des Runden Tischs aufgefordert zu prüfen, inwieweit die Inhalte der Bundesmantelverträge der Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf entgegenstehen. Auch Regelungen im Bereich der Zulassungsverordnungen sollen auf den Prüfstand gestellt werden. So wird insbesondere die Möglichkeit für Vertragsärztinnen geprüft, sich im zeitlichen Zusammenhang mit einer Entbindung vertreten zu lassen, von 6 auf 12 Monate zu verlängern. Des Weiteren wird die Möglichkeit geprüft, für die Beschäftigung eines Entlastungsassistenten1 für die Erziehung von Kindern für bis zu 36 Monate und für die Pflege von Angehörigen für 6 Monate zu schaffen. Die Kassenärztlichen Vereinigungen sollen dabei den 36bzw. 6 Monatszeitraum verlängern können. Weiterhin sollen bei der Auswahlentscheidung über die Nachbesetzung eines Vertragsarztsitzes in einem gesperrten Bereich Kindererziehungs- bzw. Pflegezeiten, durch die eine ärztliche Tätigkeit unterbrochen wurde, fiktiv berücksichtigt werden.
Bereitstellung gezielter Information über gute Initiativen
Für den Erfahrungsaustausch der Einrichtungen untereinander und die Information der Beschäftigten hielten die Beteiligten bessere Informationsmöglichkeiten für nötig, die Interessierten aufzeigen, wie konkrete Maßnahmen zu einer besseren Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf an dem jeweiligen Arbeitsplatz aussehen können.

Schon heute haben Einrichtungen des Gesundheitswesens vielfältige Möglichkeiten, gute Rahmenbedingungen für familiengerechte Arbeitsplätze zu schaffen. Diese sollten allerdings stärker genutzt werden. Dazu gehören beispielsweise der Ausbau von Kinderbetreuung, Wiedereinstiegserleichterungen für Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter nach der Elternzeit sowie Verbesserungen in der Arbeitsorganisation. Um diesen Erfahrungsaustausch zu stärken, hat das BMG bereits seit Oktober 2009 ein Projekt finanziell gefördert, bei dem beispielhafte Modelle der Aufgabenneuordnung im Krankenhaus zusammengetragen und auf einer Internetplattform veröffentlicht werden sollen. Neben der Aufgabenneuordnung ermittelt das Projekt auch Ansätze zur besseren Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf sowie zu altersgerechtem Arbeiten im Krankenhaus. Das Projekt wird durch die Deutsche Krankenhausgesellschaft (DKG) koordiniert. Im Rahmen des Projektes ist zu den genannten Themen zunächst eine Befragung bei allen Krankenhäusern in Deutschland durchgeführt worden. Anschließend wurden nach im Projektbeirat entwickelten Kriterien geeignete Modelle identifiziert, die durch qualitative Interviews genauer beleuchtet und auf der Plattform dargestellt werden sollen. Zunächst sollen zu jedem der drei Themenbereiche voraussichtlich zwischen fünf und acht Modelle auf der Plattform eingestellt werden. Die Internetplattform (http://www.pflege-krankenhaus.de/) soll kontinuierlich durch Projekte ergänzt werden, die sich um eine Aufnahme auf der Internetplattform bemühen und als modellhaft bewertet wurden. Auch für den ambulanten Bereich sind unter der Federführung der Kassenärztlichen Bundesvereinigung (KBV) eine Internetplattform sowie die Erstellung einer Broschüre über den Austausch guter Lösungen in der Erarbeitung. Eine Befragung der KBV von 12.500 Medizinstudierenden im Sommer 2010 hat ergeben, dass die Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf an erster Stelle der Erwartungen an die künftige Berufstätigkeit der Studenten steht. Dabei war es unerheblich, ob die spätere Tätigkeit im ambulanten oder stationären Bereich sein würde. Die ambulante, selbstständige Berufsausübung bietet zwar besondere Möglichkeiten der Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf, gleichzeitig existieren jedoch auch Hürden, die in vielen Fällen durch entsprechende Beratung und Unterstützung beseitigt werden können. Im Rahmen der Versorgungsmesse "Zukunft Arztpraxis" im Mai 2011 werden konkrete Beispiele der gelungenen Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf sowie Informationsangebote für selbständige Ärztinnen und Ärzte, Psychotherapeutinnen und Psychotherapeuten sowie deren Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter präsentiert.

So zeichnet sich ein familienfreundlicher Arbeitgeber im Gesundheitswesen gerade dadurch aus, dass familienfreundliche Arbeitsbedingungen zur Unternehmensphilosophie gehören und angeboten werden. Es geht also nicht

nur um einzelne Maßnahmen wie beispielsweise das Vorhalten eines Betriebskindergartens. Die Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie sollte vielmehr bei allen Organisationsentscheidungen in einer Einrichtung eine wesentliche Rolle spielen. Neben der Förderung teamoriemtierter Arbeit und dem Abbau von Hierarchien halte ich besonders die Einführung moderner Arbeitszeitmodelle mit verlässlichen Arbeitszeiten und flexiblen Teilzeitangeboten für wichtig. Da gerade auch wegen der demographischen Entwicklung der Bedarf z.B. an ärztlichem Personal für das Krankenhaus steigt und sich der Anteil der weiblichen Medizinabsolventen weiter erhöht, sind entsprechende Maßnahmen unverzichtbar. Diese Bedingungen zu schaffen, kann durch Politik in der Regel nur angestoßen werden. In erster Linie sind die Verantwortlichen vor Ort gefragt. Wir wissen längst, dass Einrichtungen, die sich bereits heute um eine mitarbeiterorientierte Arbeitsorganisation bemühen, deutlich bessere Chancen haben, freie Stellen zu besetzen und qualifizierte Beschäftigte auch längerfristig zu binden. Das BMG trägt durch Initiativen wie den Runden Tisch mit dazu bei, den nötigen Bewusstseinswandel und den Austausch über erfolgversprechende Ansätze zu unterstützen. Wollen wir dem prognostizierten Ärzte- und Pflegekräftemangel entgegenwirken und auch in Zukunft eine flächendeckende medizinische Versorgung garantieren, so müssen alle Verantwortlichen im Gesundheitssystem Initiativen ergreifen. Dabei ist es wichtig, dass alle Beteiligten Fantasie und Kreativität entwickeln, um den Wunsch zur besseren Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf nicht als Störung, sondern als Bereicherung zu begreifen und neue Wege zu gehen. Deshalb werde ich im 2. Halbjahr 2011 zu einem weiteren Treffen des Runden Tisches einladen, um die fruchtbare Zusammenarbeit mit den Experten fortzusetzen. Dann wollen wir uns über den Stand der Umsetzung der Empfehlungen austauschen und darüber beraten, ob weitere Maßnahmen ergriffen werden müssen. Ich könnte mir beispielsweise vorstellen, dass die Perspektive der Beschäftigten mit ihrer Einschätzung über vorhandene familiengerechte Arbeitsbedingungen noch stärker berücksichtigt werden sollte. Das fände ich sehr hilfreich.

Commentary

The Round Table on the "Reconciliation of Family and Career in Healthcare"

Annette Widmann-Mauz1
1 Deutscher Bundestag, Bundesministerium für Gesundheit, Parlamentarische Staatssekretärin, Berlin, Deutschland

Background
It is one of the key tasks of health policy to ensure comprehensive and adequate medical care for the population. To this end, skilled and motivated staff is essential. Already there are complaints that not all departments and regions have sufficient medical and nursing staff. This situation will worsen in the coming years, especially through demographic trends as people in our country living longer and as older people use more medical services. Studies therefore see an increasing demand for medical services with a simultaneous decrease in qualified professionals in the medical and nursing sector [1]. An important factor for attracting the needed next generation of medical and nursing professionals in the healthcare system and to retain them long-term is a balanced work-life environment for employees. Improving the compatibility of family and career for all healthcare professionals is therefore of increasing importance. The Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) will look for solutions in consultation with all stakeholders. The goal is to develop ideas and concrete measures to enable better offers for people who work in the healthcare system [2].
The Round Table
"Reconciliation of Family and Career in Healthcare"
Under my leadership two round tables were held in 2010 on the "Reconciliation of Family and Career in Healthcare" discussing the problems of reconciling work and family life. It was attended by representatives of hospitals and the medical profession including the Federation Female Doctors, nursing staff, care facilities, the unions, and the federal states and the umbrella organisation of health

insurers. All parties acknowledged the necessity and urgency of creating family-friendly conditions in the healthcare system. In December 2010 the first joint recommendations by the participants on how to better reconcile work and family in healthcare were formulated. It calls for the removal of barriers in under- and postgraduate education, the provision of targeted information on best-practice initiatives in hospitals and GP surgeries.
Under- and Postgraduate Education
The participants agreed that all possibilities should be exploited to facilitate studying full-time. But greater flexibility in the practical study modules was also considered necessary. The BMG is therefore currently considering if and to what extent changes in the training arrangements are required. The federal states should check to see if educational regulation needs to be adapted. Hospital boards, universities and university hospitals were asked to develop best-practice models for a good career-family balance, including better offers for part-time postgraduate education. The postgraduate teaching regulations of the medical federations already permit part-time postgraduate studies but to date the uptake is low. The federal and other medical chambers should encourage better use of these opportunities. The state medical federations should unify their regulations on postgraduate teaching to prevent recognition problems when moving between states. Conditions must be created in the chamber districts, hospitals and GP surgeries to allow for more part-time postgraduate training. This in particular includes training structures, the development of interlinked training and implementing measures for the staff which support the compatibility of career and family. Postgraduate training is designed differently in the healthcare professions. If postgraduate training takes

place in the workplace, training regulations differ from state to state and only some have provisions for part-time studies. The states should therefore unify their regulations and provide for part-time models. In particular, the recognition of completed units must be facilitated. The protection of expectant and nursing mothers is of great importance. But maternity protection regulations should not interfere unduly with under- and postgraduate education. The BMG has therefore referred the concerns of the Round Table to the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth for a review of the maternity provisions and if necessary to revise them and asked the Ministry to set up a working group at the federal and state level.
Federal Covering Agreements and Licensing Regulations
In addition, the partners of federal covering agreements will be asked, following the recommendations of the round table, to consider whether the content of the federal covering agreements is in conflict with the aim of reconciling work and family. The admissions regulations will also be scrutinized. In particular the option for female contract physicians for extending replacement coverage due to childbirth from 6 to 12 months will be investigated. The possibility of employing a relief assistant1 for raising children up to the age of 36 months and nursing care of relatives for up to 6 months will be examined. Associations of statutory health insurance physicians should be able to extend the 36/6 month period. Furthermore, time spent raising children or caring for relatives leading to an interruption in the employment should be notionally considered in the selection for filling posts of contracting physician.
Provision of Targeted Information on the Best-practice Initiatives
The interested parties thought that better ways of exchanging information about experiences between the bodies and for the information of the employees were needed which could demonstrate to interested parties what concrete measures could look like for a better balance between family and career at the respective workplace. Many healthcare facilities already have a variety of opportunities for creating a good environment for family-friendly jobs. However, these should be more widely used. This includes the expansion of childcare, making re-entry for employees after parental leave easier and improvements in work organization. To reinforce this exchange of experiences, the BMG has been funding a project since October 2009 which aims to collect exemplary models of task restructuring in hospitals and to publish these on an internet platform. Apart from researching task restructuring, the project will also identify approaches for better reconciliation of career and

family and age-appropriate work in hospitals. The project is coordinated by the German Hospital Federation (DKG). The initial piece of the project was a recent survey of all hospitals in Germany. The project's advisory committee then used criteria they had developed to identify appropriate models which should be looked at more closely using qualitative interviews and then published on the platform. Initially it is expected that the platform will host between five and eight models for each of the topics. The internet platform (http://www.pflege-krankenhaus.de/) will be continuously expanded with projects which apply for inclusion on the platform and which were rated as exemplary. Under the guidance of the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (KBV), the outpatient sector is also working on an internet platform and the creation of a brochure on the exchange of good solutions. A survey of 12,500 medical students carried out by the CBD in the summer of 2010 showed that the reconciliation of career and family is top of the list in terms of expectations of the future of their careers. The results were the same whether the subsequent activity was planned to be in the outpatient or inpatient sector. Although independent outpatient care offers special opportunities to reconcile career and family, it also offers obstacles which in many cases could be eliminated through appropriate counselling and support. As part of the supply exhibition "The Future of Medical Practice" in May 2011, concrete examples of a successful balance between family and work were presented, along with information offers for independent physicians, psychotherapists and their employees.
Summary
It turns out that family-friendly employers in the health sector are especially characterised by the fact that familyfriendly working conditions are part of the company's philosophy and are on offer. This means it is not just about isolated actions, such as offering a company kindergarten. Instead, the compatibility of work and family should play a significant role in all organizational decisions. In addition to promoting team-oriented work and dismantling hierarchies, I consider the introduction of modern working hours with reliable and flexible working hours for part-time positions as particularly important. Since the demographic change in particular will raise the need for medical personnel in hospitals, coupled with the continuing increase of the proportion of female medical graduates, taking appropriate action is unavoidable. Politics on the whole can only initiate such conditions. The biggest responsibility lies with the decision makers on site. We already know that institutions which are already making efforts towards employee-oriented work organization have much better chances of filling vacancies and to retain qualified employees in the long term. Through initiatives like the round table, the BMG contrib-

utes to supporting the necessary change in thinking and the sharing of promising approaches. If we wish to counteract the projected shortages of physicians and nurses and to ensure comprehensive medical care in the future, then all managers in the healthcare system must take action. It is important that all involved parties develop their imagination and creativity so the desire to reconcile career and family is not seen as an intrusion but rather as an enrichment and an opportunity to explore new avenues. For this reason, I will send out invitations for a further meeting of the round table in the second half of 2011 so we can continue the fruitful collaboration with the experts. It will enable us to exchanges news on the state of the implementation of the recommendations and to debate if further action needs to be taken. It is conceivable, for example, that the employees' perspective on existing family-friendly working conditions should be given greater attention. I would consider this very helpful.
Note
1 Editors note: According to § 32 Sect 2 Sentence 2 of the Medical Licensure Act the purpose of a relief assistant is securing the statutory health insurance physician coverage if the physician cannot fulfil these duties, for example due to health limitations. The employment period is fixed.
