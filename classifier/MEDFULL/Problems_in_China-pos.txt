ABSTRACT
COVID-19, and efforts to mitigate its spread, are creating extensive mental health problems. Experts have speculated the mental, economic, behavioral, and psychosocial problems linked to the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a rise in suicide behavior. However, a quantitative synthesis is needed to reach an overall conclusion regarding the pandemic-suicide link. In the most comprehensive test of the COVID-19--suicidality link to date, we meta-analyzed data from 308,596 participants across 54 studies. Our results suggested increased event rates for suicide ideation (10.81%), suicide attempts (4.68%), and self-harm (9.63%) during the COVID-19 pandemic when considered against event rates from pre-pandemic studies. Moderation analysis indicated younger people, women, and individuals from democratic countries are most susceptible to suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policymakers and helping professionals are advised that suicide behaviors are alarmingly common during the COVID-19 pandemic and vary based upon age, gender, and geopolitics. Strong protections from governments (e.g., implementing best practices in suicide prevention) are urgently needed to reduce suicide behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 virus, and efforts to mitigate its spread, are creating serious mental health problems around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic is linked to alarming increases in depression and anxiety, isolation and loneliness, alcohol and cannabis misuse, and unemploy­ ment and other economic problems (e.g., Killgore et al., 2020b; Luo et al., 2020).
Negative sequelae of the pandemic are also not equally or randomly distributed across people or places. Disadvantaged and marginalized people, such as those who are Black (e.g., Bray et al., 2020) or people with pre-existing mental health problems (e.g., Taylor and Asmundson, 2020), appear especially vulnerable to the pandemic's negative psy­ chosocial impacts.
Many experts have voiced concerns that mental, economic, behav­ ioral, and psychosocial problems linked to the COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to a rise in suicide behaviors (e.g., McIntyre and Lee, 2020; Samson and Sherry, 2020). These include suggested increases in suicide ideation (thoughts about killing oneself), suicide attempts (non-fatal, potentially self-injurious behavior with intent to die), and self-harm

(non-fatal, deliberate, self-injurious behavior without intent to die).
1.1. Advancing research on COVID-19 and suicide
Understanding of the pandemic-suicide link is limited at present. First, non-empirical narrative reviews on COVID-19 and suicide are abundant (e.g., Gunnell et al., 2020), but these reviews do not clarify, quantitatively, how strong an impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on suicide behaviors. Second, among empirical studies, there are notable inconsistencies in findings between studies, with some studies reporting suicide behaviors are higher (e.g., Zhang et al., 2020), and other studies reporting suicide behaviors are largely unchanged (e.g., Isumi et al., 2020). A rigorous quantitative synthesis is needed to resolve these in­ consistencies and reach an overall conclusion. Third, numerous studies on COVID-19 and suicide involve smaller samples (N = < 250; e.g., Benatti et al., 2020), which suggests research on COVID-19 and suicide might be underpowered (see Button et al. (2013) and Ioannidis (2005) for overviews of how sample size affects power). Larger samples are needed to provide more stable estimates of the underlying population (e. g., Scho¨nbrodt and Perugini, 2013). Fourth, moderation analyses will

allow for greater precision in understanding the pandemic-suicide relationship. Age, sex, ethnicity, country of residence, and geopolitics (e.g., living under a democratic government or an authoritarian gov­ ernment) may potentially moderate the relationship between COVID-19 and suicide, clarifying who is more or less vulnerable to suicide be­ haviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and allowing for more targeted interventions.
1.2. Present study: objectives and hypotheses
Our objective was to conduct the most comprehensive test of the pandemic-suicidality link to date. We addressed the above-mentioned limitations by conducting a meta-analysis that comprehensively and quantitatively synthesized extant research on COVID-19 and suicide behaviors. Such a rigorous synthesis will help to resolve inconsistencies observed between studies by correcting for distorting artifacts (e.g., small samples). Moreover, meta-analytic moderation will identify po­ tential groups differentially susceptible to suicide behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Some authors have acknowledged the possibility suicide rates may decrease during the COVID-19 pandemic, with suicide behaviors decreasing as people pull together amid shared pandemic-related ad­ versities (Reger et al., 2020). In contrast, experts have cautioned that mental health and behavioral problems, economic stressors, and psy­ chosocial upheaval linked to the pandemic may lead to a rise in suicide behavior (e.g., Gunnell et al., 2020). Consistent with the latter perspective, we hypothesized a serious increase in suicide behaviors has occurred during the pandemic, including increases in rates of suicide ideation, attempts, and self-harm (relative to event rates available from pre-pandemic studies). Our moderation analyses were exploratory, as there are insufficient data and theory to inform specific hypotheses.
2. Method
2.1. Selection of studies
We developed our search strategy in consultation with a Research Data Management Librarian and conducted our search in eight data­ bases: PsycINFO, PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, Web of Science, ERIC, Embase, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. We used the following search terms: (TITLE (suicid*) OR ABS (suicid*)) AND (TITLE (COVID-19 OR "2019 novel coronavirus disease" OR "COVID19 OR "SARS-CoV-2 infection" OR "2019 novel coronavirus infection" OR "2019-nCoV infection" OR "coronavirus disease 2019 OR "coronavirus disease-19 OR "2019-nCoV disease") OR ABS ((COVID-19) OR "2019 novel coronavirus disease" OR "COVID19 OR "SARS-CoV-2 infection" OR "2019 novel coronavirus infection" OR "2019-nCoV infection" OR "coronavirus disease 2019 OR "coronavirus disease-19 OR "2019-nCoV disease")). We identified 1010 studies via this search. Two additional studies were identified from the reference sec­ tions of articles identified by our initial search. We terminated our literature search and began our study screening and data extraction on November 6, 2020. The first author and a trained research assistant used the following pre-determined criteria to identify studies eligible for in­ clusion in the current meta-analysis: (a) contained data on suicidal behavior (i.e., ideation, attempts, self-harm) that was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) reported information to calculate the proportion of participants that endorsed suicide behavior during COVID-19; (c) written in English. We did not restrict studies for inclu­ sion based on sample characteristics (e.g., age) or publication type. Agreement between coders on inclusion was 92.36%. We resolved dis­ crepancies in agreement through discussion among the research team until a consensus of 100% was reached. The final dataset was comprised of 54 studies with 62 samples (see Table 1 and Fig. 1).

2.2. Coding of studies
Studies were coded on the following variables: sample size, sample type, mean age, percentage female participants, percentage White par­ ticipants, study design, publication status, country, political regime and democracy index score (as per the Economist Intelligence Unit, 2020), and suicide behaviors (see Table 1). Suicide behavior included ideation, attempts, and self-harm. To calculate event rates of suicide behaviors, behaviors that were assessed on continuous scales were converted to dichotomous values (i.e., to indicate the presence or absence of a given suicide behavior). Dichotomization of continuous variables was completed because many studies included in our analyses had assessed suicide behaviors on a binary scale (e.g., Ammerman et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2020; Every-Palmer et al., 2020).
2.3. Meta-Analysis
We used Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Borenstein et al., 2005) to calculate overall effects using random-effect models. For studies with measurement occasions occurring in both the pre-pandemic and the pandemic periods, we extracted data collected during the pandemic period, as there were not enough studies to analyze pre- to post-pandemic changes in our suicide behavior variables. For studies that assessed suicide behavior at multiple time-points during the pandemic period, we averaged the prevalence of these behaviors across measurement occasions to derive a more reliable estimate (see Card, 2016).
Homogeneity was assessed by determining the total heterogeneity of weighted mean effects (QT) and the total variation across studies attributable to heterogeneity (I2). When QT was significant, and when there was sufficient content coverage (five or more studies for contin­ uous moderators and three or more samples per subgroup for categorical moderators), random-effect meta-regressions with maximum likelihood estimation were used to test the moderating effect of three continuous and four categorical variables: sex (mean percentage of females), age (mean age), democracy index score (where a higher score indicates a greater level of democracy), sample type (clinical, community, and frontline), COVID-19 restriction type (various restrictions, lockdown, and quarantine), region (North America, Western Europe, and AsiaAustralasia), and study design (case-control, cross-sectional, and longi­ tudinal) on observed event rates. We refer to these analysis as "moder­ ation" (e.g., Schmidt and Hunter, 2015; p. 317) because we tested whether point estimates for suicide behavior event rates depended on levels of the different study variables that we coded for. Eight models were tested for each suicide behavior event rate. These models included the following predictors: sex; age; sample type; democracy index score; COVID-19 restriction type; region; study design; and sex, age, sample type, democracy index score, COVID-19 restriction type, region, and study design simultaneously (Supplemental Material A). When moder­ ators were significant, corresponding scatter plots are provided in Sup­ plemental Material B.
2.4. Description of studies
Our search identified 54 studies (51 journal articles, two pre-prints, and one newsletter) suitable for inclusion (Table 1). All included studies were published in the year 2020. Sample size varied (range: 14 to 69,054, M = 4977.35, SD = 11,897.88). The number of participants pooled across samples was 308,596. There were 32 community samples, 21 clinical samples, and nine frontline samples. The mean sample age was 34.2 (SD = 10.5) years. The mean percentage of females was 57.5% (SD = 20.1). The mean percentage of White participants was 66.3% (SD = 19.0). In terms of geopolitical characteristics, 29 samples (46.8%) were located in the Asia-Australasia region, 15 samples (24.2%) in North America, 13 samples in Western Europe (21.0%), two samples (3.2%) in Eastern Europe, two samples (3.2%) in Latin America, and one sample

was comprised of participants from 52 different countries (1.6%). Most samples (n = 26; 41.9%) were from countries with "flawed" democratic political regimes, 18 samples (29.0%) were from countries with "authoritarian" regimes, 13 samples (21.0%) were from "full demo­ cratic" regimes, and four samples (6.5%) were from counties with "hybrid" regimes. The political regime of one sample (1.6%) was not classified because its participants were from 52 different countries. The

mean democracy index score (Economist Intelligence Unit, 2020) was 6.19 (SD = 2.68). In terms of suicide behavior, the presence of suicide ideation was assessed in 55 samples, suicide attempts in 13 samples, and self-harm in nine samples.

2.5. Suicide behaviors
Suicide ideation was measured by self-report (k = 38; 69.1%), medical record review (k = 7; 12.7%), and psychiatric evaluation or interview (k = 5; 9.1%); the method for assessing suicide ideation was unreported for five samples (9.1%). Suicide attempts were measured by

self-report (k = 6; 46.2%), medical record review (k = 6; 46.2%), and semi-structed interview (k = 1; 7.6%). Self-harm was measured by medical record review (k = 6; 66.7%) and self-report (k = 3; 33.3%).

3. Results
3.1. Meta-Analysis
The overall weighted mean prevalence rates of suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and self-harm during COVID-19 appear in Table 2. The event rate for suicide ideation was 10.81% for the combined samples; it was 11.84%, 10.70%, and 6.96% for community, clinical, and frontline samples, respectively. For suicide attempts, the event rate was 4.68% for the combined samples, 2.68% for the community samples, and 10.87% for the clinical samples. The event rate for self-harm was 9.63% in the combined samples, 6.11% in the community samples, and 12.03% for the clinical samples. The percentage of total heterogeneity across sam­ ples ranged from 91.20% to 99.90%, suggesting the potential influence of moderators on certain prevalence rates.
3.2. Moderator analysis
After the inclusion of covariates, meta-regressions revealed the following. The sex of participants moderated the prevalence of suicide ideation during the pandemic (see Supplementary Table A1), indicating the prevalence of ideation increased as the mean percentage of female participants in the sample increased (B1 = 2.19, p = .036; Supplemen­ tary Figure B1). Likewise, mean age and democracy index score moderated the prevalence of suicide ideation during the pandemic, such that the prevalence of ideation increased as sample age decreased (B = - 0.29, p = .015; Supplementary Figure B2) and the prevalence of ideation increased as the democracy index score increased (B = 0.15, p = .004; Supplementary Figure B3).
Regarding other suicide behaviors, democracy index scores also moderated the prevalence of suicide attempts during the pandemic, suggesting the prevalence of attempts decreased as the democracy index score increased (B = - 0.57, p = .040; Supplementary Figure B4). Mean age and democracy index score moderated the prevalence of self-harm, such that the prevalence of self-harm decreased as age increased (B = - 0.04, p = .020; Supplementary Figure B5), and the prevalence of selfharm decreased as democracy index score increased (B = - 0.17, p = .004; Supplementary Figure B6).
As Supplementary Table A1 shows, meta-regression indicated sui­ cide ideation was more prevalent in clinical vs community and frontline samples (see Supplementary Figure B7). Suicide ideation was also more prevalent in Asia-Australasia and in North America vs Western Europe (see Supplementary Figure B8). Results also indicated the prevalence of suicide attempts was significantly higher in clinical versus community samples (see Supplementary Figure B9).
3.3. Publication bias
Funnel plots (see Supplemental Material C) and Egger's regression intercepts (see Table 2) provided mixed evidence for publication bias. Egger's regression intercept was non-significant for all effects.
4. Conclusion
Experts caution mental health and behavioral problems, serious economic difficulties, and multiple psychosocial stressors linked to the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a rise in suicide behaviors (Gunnell et al., 2020; McIntyre and Lee, 2020). But narrative reviews, inconsis­ tent findings, and underpowered studies have clouded understanding of
1 The point estimate, B, represents the rate of change in the "log odds" of an event as the independent variable changes. For example, the effect of sex is e2.19 = 8.93, which means that a one-unit change in the mean percentage of female participants would make suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic 8.93 times more likely (0.899/0.101) to occur.

the prevalence of suicide behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We addressed these limitations by conducting a rigorous meta-analytic re­ view of suicide behavior rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings derived from 308,596 participants and 54 studies suggested suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and self-harm have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic (relative to event rates from pre-pandemic studies), with younger people, women, and individuals from democratic coun­ tries appearing most vulnerable to suicide ideation.
4.1. Advancing understanding of COVID-19 and suicide
Consistent with hypotheses, our meta-analysis suggested increased event rates for suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic. These event rates are high in relation to prepandemic studies; for example, Liu et al. (2020) in their pre-pandemic meta-analysis of nine studies and 40,292 participants, concluded: "approximately one in 20 individuals in the general population experi­ ence passive ideation in any given year" (p. 374). However, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 11.84% of community members are experiencing suicide ideation (see Table 2). This suggests that during the COVID-19 pandemic 2.37 in 20 individuals in the general population are experiencing suicide ideation. Put differently, whereas Lui et al.'s (2020) 12-month rate of suicide ideation was 5.81% for community members, our observed rate of suicide ideation for a similar group was 11.84% during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The magnitude of the difference between suicide behaviors before and during the COVID-19 pandemic will depend, in part, on the com­ parison made. Such comparisons also are much less rigorous than lon­ gitudinal data, which we did not cover in the current study due to insufficient data. Thus, pre- to post-pandemic comparisons should be interpreted with great caution. That said, in examining several prepandemic meta-analyses of suicide behaviors (e.g., Castillejos et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020), our observed event rates for suicide ideation, suicide attempts and self-harm stand out as elevated and point toward a serious crisis in suicide behaviors occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic. As most participants in our study reported on their suicide behaviors for a relatively brief time period (i.e., the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic as opposed to reporting on their suicide behaviors for a full 12-months of the pandemic), it is also possible a longer reporting time period would capture an even higher prevalence of sui­ cide behaviors.
We also brought greater specificity to understanding the pan­ demic-suicidality link, with our moderation analyses suggesting younger individuals, women, and those residing in democratic countries are more vulnerable to suicide behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This complements a wider literature suggesting COVID-19s negative impacts are felt disproportionately by some people or in some places (e.g., Bray et al., 2020). In a pandemic where so many are in need, these findings can inform more targeted interventions. Finally, the de­ gree to which a country is democratic appears pivotal in understanding the pandemic-suicide link, with suicide ideation increasing and suicide attempts and self-harm decreasing as democracy increases. There is much to learn about how political systems, public health measures, healthcare, media, and perceived or actual loss of control and freedom influence how suicide behaviors manifest during the COVID-19 pandemic.
4.1. Limitations and future directions
Most included studies were cross-sectional, meaning our metaanalysis offers a static picture of an evolving pandemic and suggests more multi-wave longitudinal studies are needed. The absence of such studies from our analyses precludes us making any strong statements about changes from before to after the pandemic. Mono-source designs were also common in our included studies, leaving our results vulner­ able to the distorting influence of potentially biased self-reporting and

6

indicating a need for alternative methods (e.g., informant reports). Additionally, included studies involved mainly younger (mean age of 35.3, SD = 11.7), female, and White participants, placing limits on the generalizability of our results, and underlining the need to study the pandemic-suicide link in more diverse samples. Finally, reliable data regarding deaths by suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic were scarce at the time of writing and are therefore absent from our analyses. Future research could use population level statistics (e.g., from national census bureaus and/or police databases) to determine the prevalence of deaths by suicide during the pandemic once these data are available.
4.2. Implications
Both policymakers and helping professionals are advised that suicide behaviors are rising during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is challenging to identify (Franklin et al., 2017) and to treat (Fox et al., 2020) an indi­ vidual who is likely to die by suicide, perhaps especially during a pandemic that can monopolize healthcare resources and that can discourage help-seeking (e.g., due to COVID-19 contamination fears or lockdown conditions). Despite the difficulty in doing so, population-wide, evidence-based public health interventions designed to prevent suicide should be implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as limiting access to lethal means (e.g., guns) and to suicide-linked substances (e.g., alcohol; see Gunnell et al., 2020). Strong and continued protections from governments against economic stressors (e.g., protections against unemployment or loss of income) are also needed to reduce suicide behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic (see Norstro¨m & Gro¨nqvist, 2015). Consistent with Wang et al. (2021), we believe our findings speak to the importance of adopting measures to mitigate the psychological burden of living amidst a pandemic. These measures include psychoeducation about the impact of individual be­ haviors on mental health (e.g., media consumption; Burhamah et al., 2020), increased access to mental health supports and effective pre­ vention programs that reduce suicidal ideation for vulnerable groups (e. g., Kelly et al., 2020), and normalizing help-seeking behavior (Schwartz et al., 2020)
4.3. Conclusions
Our meta-analysis provides the most comprehensive test of the pandemic-suicide ideation link to date. COVID-19, and efforts to miti­ gate its spread, are linked to a rise in suicide behavior, including increased event rates for suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and selfharm. In particular, our results suggest younger people, women, and individuals from democratic countries are most vulnerable to suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study also aligns with theory and research indicating that the mental, economic, behavioral, and psychosocial problems linked to the COVID-19 pandemic are tied to a rise in suicide behaviors relative to event rates from pre-pandemic meta-analyses.

Abstract: Cancer, which is the second most common cause of death after cardiovascular diseases, is one of the most important health problems of today. Discovery of effective treatments and drugs are important in cancer treatment. The COVID-19 epidemic, which broke out in Wuhan province of China in December 2019 and is considered as a pandemic worldwide, affected millions of people. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes this epidemic, affects the lungs, heart, brain, kidneys, gastrointestinal system, ovaries and testicles and various drugs are used in the treatment. In this study, we aimed to determine the cytotoxic effect of favipiravir, dornase alfa and ivermectin, which are drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19, on human lung cancer cell line (A549). Favipiravir, dornase alfa and ivermectin concentrations were prepared in doubly increasing doses (0.5-64 µg/mL). The prepared concentrations were tested on human A549 cells. After 24 hours of incubation, the cytotoxic effects of the drugs on cancer cells were detected by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) method. The results were given as % viability. It was determined that favipiravir, dornase alfa and ivermectin significantly decreased the cell viability in lung cancer cell line with increasing application doses (p<0.05).

Introduction
Cancer is a health problem that forms a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled division and proliferation of cells in an organ or tissue followed by metastasis to other parts of the body (Jackson & Loeb 2001) and manifested by disruption of molecular pathways (Sivanandam et al. 2010, Varkaris et al. 2014). The complexity of molecular pathways involved in the process of carcinogenesis is one of the most important factors that makes cancer treatment difficult and slows down the development of molecular targeted therapy. In this context,

it is very important to analyze the developmental stages of the cancer process properly and to apply the correct treatment for patients to regain their health.
Unfortunately, there is no definitive treatment method for cancer. In addition to classical treatment methods such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery in cancer treatment, additional targeted applications (healthy nutrition, regular physical activity, avoidance of stress and targeted therapies) are important for the success of

treatments (Huang et al. 2010, Nettore et al. 2018, Serda et al. 2018). Considering the complex process of cancer and different physiological characteristics of patients, the discovery of more effective drugs in cancer treatment constitute a very important research area.
The COVID-19 epidemic, which appeared in Wuhan province of China in December 2019 and was admited a global pandemic in March 2020, is considered a global threat to public health. COVID-19 patients are either asymptomatic or have the disease with clinical course ranging from mild to severe pneumonia, respiratory failure and sometimes death. In addition to comprehensive public health preventions to deal with this disease, an unprecedented global effort is under way to identify effective drugs for treatment. As a result of understanding the virology of SARS-CoV-2, current and effective pharmacological treatments against COVID-19 are being researched (Potì et al. 2020). Favipiravir, dornase alfa and ivermectin are among the potential therapeutic agents used in the treatment of COVID-19.
Favipiravir is an antiviral drug approved in Japan (Joshi et al. 2021). Favipiravir triphosphate is a purine analog that is a competitive inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Coomes & Haghbayan 2020). It has been used in many countries to treat new viral infections, including Ebola and Lassa. As an antiviral drug, Favipravir is authorized for use in the treatment of COVID-19 in many countries, including Japan, Russia and India, under emergency provisions (Nagakrishna & Thawani 2020).
Dornase alfa, known as the recombinant form of the human DNase I enzyme, is a drug that has been used for years to reduce the severity of infections in respiratory diseases and improve lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis. It is well known that pneumonia related with COVID-19 progresses to severe acute respiratory syndrome and even multiple organ failure. The highly viscous mucus structure observed in cystic fibrosis was reported to be very similar to that in COVID-19 (Okur et al. 2020). Dornase alfa was found to exert anti-viral effect against coronavirus in Madin-Darbybovine kidney cell line (MDBK) and green monkey kidney cell line (Vero) without cytotoxicity on healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Okur et al. 2020).
The potential of ivermectin to reduce transmission of mosquito-induced malaria is being evaluated by various studies worldwide. Ivermectin is reported to inhibit the in vitro replication of some positive, single-stranded RNA viruses, such as Zika virus, yellow fever virus, dengue virus (DNV) etc. Recently, ivermectin has been reported to strongly inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro (Chaccour et al. 2020).
This study was carried out to have a preunderstanding for how can be affected lung cells in vitro when a person both COVID-19 and lung cancer if use these drugs, also to determine the cytotoxic effects of favipiravir, dornase alfa and ivermectin on A549 cells. Moreover, since lack of information about cytotoxic effects of COVID-19

drugs on lung cancer cells in literature, this study was performed. However, experimental studies and analyses in this study should be supported with clinical applications and in vivo experiments.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions
The study was carried out at Bartin University Central Research Laboratory, Anticancer Research Laboratory. A549 cell line (ATCC) was used as the cell type in the study. Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA; prepared by adding 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin and 100 U/mL penicillin) was used to feed A549 cells. Cells were cultured in 75 cm2 culture flasks (TPP; Switzerland) and the cultures were incubated in a humidified incubator (37°C, 5% CO2; N-biotech, Korea). The medium was changed every 3-4 days and the cell passages were made when the cells reached 80-90% confluence.
Test drugs
0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 µg/mL concentrations of favipiravir (Santa Cruz Inc.), dornase alfa (Genentech) and ivermectin (Santa Cruz Inc.) were prepared in DMEM (for A549 cells).
MTT assay
The effects of favipiravir, dornase alfa and ivermectin on A549 cell viability were determined by the MTT (3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) method. Confluent cells were scraped from the bottom of the flasks with Trypsin-EDTA and then counted under the microscope. The cells were seeded in the 96-well plates at a density of 15×103 cells per well. The seeded cells were incubated at 37°C in an incubator with CO2 for 24 h. The media were changed following the incubation, different concentrations of favipiravir, dornase alfa and ivermectin were added to the wells in which the cells were seeded, and the incubation was done for 24 h (Koran et al. 2017). Subsequently, the media in the wells were withdrawn, then MTT solution (0.5 mg/mL) prepared in sterile Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 3 h. Subsequently, the solution in the wells was withdrawn and incubation was stopped by adding 100 L dimethyl sulfoxide to each well. Optical densities of the cells in microplates were determined by a spectrophotometer (Thermo, Multiscango) at 570 nm wavelength (Mosmann 1983).
The average of the absorbance values of the control wells was calculated and these values were determined as 100% cell viability. Percentages of viability values of cells were determined by proportioning the absorbance values obtained from the wells treated with favipiravir, dornase alfa and ivermectin to the control absorbance value. MTT assays were done 10 times on different days, with double repeats for each plate. According to the MTT assay results, the half maximal inhibitory concentration value (IC50) was calculated using GraphPad Prism 9 (San Diego, CA, USA).

Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism 9 package program for Windows was used in statistical analyses. One-way ANOVA was used to detect differences among the groups and multiple comparisons were analyzed with Tukey's test. Quantitative data were given as the mean with standard deviation (mean±SD) and p<0.05 was indicated as statistically significant.
Results
The cytotoxic effects of favipiravir and dornase alfa drugs on human lung cancer cell line (A549) are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, respectively. A decrease in cell viability was determined for favipiravir at concentrations of 2 µg/mL and above (2-64 µg/mL) and for dornase alfa at all concentrations (0-64 µg/mL), compared to the control group. These decreases in cell viability were statistically significant (p<0.05).

The effects of the ivermectin on cell viability of A549 human lung cancer cell line are shown in Fig. 3. Although a significant dose dependent decrease in viability of A549 cells treated with ivermectin was detected at concentrations of 0.5-4 µg/mL compared to control, cell viability remained almost constant between 4-64 µg/mL concentrations.
We also detected the IC50 values of the drugs used. While IC50 values of favipiravir and dornasa alfa were calculated almost close to each other, IC50 value of ivermectin was relatively lower than favipiravir and dornase alfa (Table 1).

Discussion
Studies reported that various anti-diabetic, antipsychotic, anti-malarial and antiviral drugs have antineoplastic properties against lung, prostate, colorectal, gastric, breast and overian tumors (Kaushik et al. 2021). In preclinical studies, it was determined that these nonneoplastic drugs trigger apoptosis by various intracellular signaling mechanisms, stop cell proliferation and exert anti-metastatic effects. Some anti-neoplastic drugs give positive results for cancer in clinical studies (Kaushik et al. 2020). Because of these features, it is important to define new therapeutic agents and to determine their biological activities in cancer research.

Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug (Khan et al. 2020) and has been reported as an anticancer agent in some cancer types due to its potential to inhibit tumor growth (Sharmeen et al. 2010, Melotti et al. 2014). Ivermectin was reported to have an anti-proliferative effect on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)

176
cells. Ivermectin also significantly inhibits ESCC cell growth, migration and invasion by blocking PAK1 signaling (Chen et al. 2020). We showed that ivermectin decreased A549 cell viability. However, the molecular mechanism of this effect can be elucidated by further studies.
In another study, the cytotoxic effect of ivermectin on human stomach cancer cell lines (MKN1, MKN7, MKN28, MKN45, MKN74, SH-10-TC, NUGC-3, NUGC-4, AGS, GSU and KE-39, RIKEN) was investigated for 48 hours and among the cell lines tested, it was shown that MKN1 cells were the most sensitive to ivermectin and SH-10-TC cells were also drug sensitive. In contrast, MKN7 cells and MKN28 cells were resistant to ivermectin. Therefore, MKN1 and SH-10-TC cells are defined as ivermectin sensitive and MKN7 and MKN28 cells as ivermectin resistant cells (Nambara et al. 2017). In our study, A549 cells did not show resistance to the test drugs we used.
Additionally, ivermectin has been reported to induce cell death in human leukemia cells (OCI-AML2, HL60, U937, KG1a) through chloride influx, membrane hyperpolarization, and increased intracellular ROS levels (Sharmeen et al. 2010).
As a result, we investigated, for the first time, the cytotoxic effects of favipiravir, ivermectin and dornase alfa, which are drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19, on human lung cancer cells (A549). In our study, we detected for the first time that favipiravir, dornase alfa and

ivermectin decreased cell viability by showing cytotoxic effects in human lung cancer cell line. The IC50 values on A549 cells were 12.55, 12.13 and 0.306 µg/mL for favipiravir, dornase alfa and ivermectin, respecitevely.
In conclusion, favipiravir, dornase alfa and ivermectin can be considered to be important therapeutic agents due to their potential cytotoxic effects on A549 cells in vitro. With further studies, it can be revealed how these drugs affect molecular mechanisms in cancer cells and its use in cancer treatment can be investigated with in vivo and clinical studies.

Abstract Numerous studies have been conducted to identify the effects of natural crises on supply chain performance. Conventional analysis methods are based on either manual filter methods or data-driven methods. The manual filter methods suffer from validation problems due to sampling limitations, and data-driven methods suffer from the nature of crisis data which are vague and complex. This study aims to present an intelligent analysis model to automatically identify the effects of natural crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic on the supply chain through metadata generated on social media. This paper presents a thematic analysis framework to extract knowledge under user steering. This framework uses a text-mining approach, including co-occurrence term analysis and knowledge map construction. As a case study to approve our proposed model, we retrieved, cleaned, and analyzed 1024 online textual reports on supply chain crises published during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019-2021. We conducted a thematic analysis of the collected data and achieved a knowledge map on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the supply chain. The resultant knowledge map consists of five main areas (and related sub-areas), including (1) food retail, (2) food services, (3) manufacturing, (4) consumers, and (5) logistics. We checked and validated the analytical results with some field experts. This experiment achieved 53 crisis knowledge propositions classified from 25,272 sentences with 631,799 terms and 31,864 unique terms using just three user-system interaction steps, which shows the model's high performance. The results lead us to conclude that the proposed model could be used effectively and efficiently as a decision support system, especially for crises in the supply chain analysis.

Introduction
Global supply chains (SC) have always been vulnerable to shocks, especially in exporting countries (Trautrims et al. 2020; Shanker et al. 2021). This vulnerability stems from the factors that disrupt the integration of the production of goods

and services between these countries and their importer trading partners (Maillet et al. 2019). Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed serious threats and risks to the SC in all sectors (Karwasra et al. 2021; Sharma et al. 2020). These risks are mainly due to lockdown measures that governments adopt and apply in the form of health policies against the COVID-19 outbreak, which imposes restrictions on "movement," "production," "logistics," and "business activities" (Menut et al. 2020; Karwasra et al. 2021).
For example, China was one of India's primary importers of raw materials for drug production between 2018 and 2019. Due to the pandemic, the import of raw materials was disrupted, and the Indian pharmaceutical industry faced shortages and delays in the supply and distribution of pharmaceutical products (Guerin et al. 2020). The shipping industry, which involves about 90% of world trade, has been severely affected by government lockdown policies. Hence,

the World Trade Organization (WTO) announced that the volume of world trade has decreased by about 23% by the end of 2020 (Palmeter et al. 2022). Also, due to disruption in the food SC, 285 million people worldwide suffered from severe starvation by the end of 2020 (Rizou et al. 2020).
Such significant changes significantly increase the need to examine the pandemic effects on the SC as an essential and distinctive case study. In this regard, due to the extensive discussions and scientific research that is conducted on the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis on social media, this media has become a constructive database for identifying and analyzing the risk in the SC (Aghion et al. 2008; Bakhtin et al. 2020; Spitsberg et al. 2013; Momeni and Rost 2016).
Various quantitative and qualitative methods have been used to analyze the SC crisis in the literature (Wan et al. 2021). The comprehensiveness of the findings in qualitative methods is questionable due to the limitations of the samples (Ponis and Ntalla, 2016). There is also concern about the bias of results in these methods due to human judgments (Arlinghaus et al. 2020; Schorsch et al. 2017; Pulji, 2010).
Following the increase in data and analytical news on social media, research has recently moved to the use of quantitative data-driven methods. However, these methods also have major drawbacks. Due to the nature of risk, which is ambiguous and complex and has different meanings, processing these data by pure data mining methods is impossible and requires human insight to identify risks.
This scientific gap in the analysis and identification of crisis management continues. Therefore, one of the serious motivations for this research is to provide a practical framework for analyzing and identifying the effects of a crisis on the SC using a large amount of available data. This framework gathers the contents of the online analytical reports, converts these data into interpretable structured information, and finally provides classified knowledge on crisis analysis through user interactions. The framework could be used in decision support systems of companies or governments. To validate the proposed model's effectiveness, we collected 975 online reports about the impact of COVID-19 on SCs between 2019 and 2021 and analyzed them using the framework.
In general, this paper presents a framework to analyze the effects of a crisis on the SC and reports the results from a case study to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results user achieves from interactions using thematic analysis could also be used to unfold the research gap and future research guidelines in SC crisis analysis.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The "Literature review and related works" section provides available knowledge for the research topics and related research and expresses the research gap. The " Methodology: framework for identifying the effects of natural crises on the supply chain" section presents the methodology used in this

research. The "Case analysis" section evaluates the framework's effectiveness by analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on the SC case study. The "Discussion" section discusses the research findings, and finally, the "Conclusion" section concludes the paper.
Literature review and related works
Text analysis technical methods
Various text analysis techniques related to this research are discussed in this section, including Word2vec, knowledge map, TFIDF, topic modeling, and text-mining.
Word2vec model
In order to process texts, words must be converted to numerical quantities. One of the most widely used methods is the word2vec model. The Word2vec model is a neural network-based model that converts words into numeric vectors (Mikolov et al. 2013). Its input is a text corpus, and its output is a set of real-valued feature vectors; each vector represents or encodes the meaning of one word in the corpus. Thus, the words closer in vector space are expected to be similar in meaning (Jurafsky and Martin 2008). There are two models, Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Skipgram, for learning underlying word representations for each word by using neural networks in the word2vec model. The CBOW model is used for word2vec in this paper.
Cooccurrence network and knowledge map
One of the text analysis methods used in this research is the co-occurrence network, also referred to as the knowledge map (KM) (Segev 2020). This method involves visualizing potential relationships between concepts or other entities represented in textual data (Freilich et al. 2010). The process of building a co-occurrence network includes (Segev 2021):
· Identifying keywords in the text, · Calculating the frequencies of terms, and · Analyzing networks for finding central terms and clusters
of terms in the network.
In co-occurrence networks, the connecting pairs of terms are defined based on their paired presence in a textual unit. Co-occurrence networks are generated by linking pairs of terms using a set of criteria that define concurrency (Freilich et al. 2010).

TFIDF

The term frequency-inverse document frequency

(TFIDF) is determined to filter public words from the

dataset and highlight the most important words (Jing

et al. 2002). It has been widely used to improve process-

ing accuracy as an indicator of general and important

terms (Gudivada et al. 2018). The principle of apply-

ing TFIDF is explained as follows. By applying this

method, terms that are frequently used in any document

(such as conjunction words) have a low rank (Qaiser

and Ali 2018). The equations (Eqs. 1-3) show TFIDF

calculation:



tf (t, d) = ft d td ft d

,

,

(1)

idf (t, D) = log(N(1 + |{d  D  t  d}|))

(2)

TFIDF(t, d, D) = tf (t, d).idf (t, D)

(3)

In the above equations, ft,d is the number of times that term t occurs in document d, N is the number of documents in the corpus, and |{d  D  t  d}| is the number of documents where the term t appears. If the term is not in the corpus, this will lead to a division-by-zero. Therefore, it is common to adjust the denominator to 1 + |{d  D  t  d}|.

Topic modeling

In machine learning language and natural language processing, topic modeling is a distinctive statistical model for discovering essential topics in a set of documents. Topic modeling is a widely used text-mining tool to find hidden semantic structures in a text (Blei 2012). Since each document is about a specific topic, certain words are expected to appear in its textual content. The topics extracted from topic modeling technique are a group of similar words cluster. Topic models are statistical algorithms to discover the hidden semantic structures of a text (Cao and Li 2007). One of the most common methods for topic modeling is the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei 2012). LDA is an unsupervised learning model used as a topic modeling technique that can classify text in a document into specific topics. This technique uses the Dirichlet distribution to discover topics for each document model and words for each topic model.
Figure 1 presents the core components of LDA algorithm, where K is the number of topics, N is the number of words in the document, M denotes the number of documents,  is the parameter of the Dirichlet prior to the perdocument topic distributions,  is the same parameter of the per-topic word distribution, (k) is the word distribution for topic k, (i) is the topic distribution for document

Equation 4 is shown below:



 N    





p wi + zi + i,  , = j=1p i p zi,j i p( )p wi,j zi,j

(4)

Each word in the corpus is randomly classified into a subject and tagged with a specific subject number. Then, according to the algorithm sample function, a new subject number is assigned to each word. This process continues until it converges.

Textmining and its applications in supply chain management

The existing literature confirms the critical role of artificial intelligence in various industry fields such as healthcare, education, crisis management, and production. For example, Sharifi et al. (2021) studied the impact of artificial intelligence and digital style on industry and energy after the COVID-19 pandemic. Their object was to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on the various fields of medicine, industry, and energy. Artificial intelligence technology tries to improve the efficiency of the management process during the crisis response. In particular, they have studied the effect of artificial intelligence and digital style in reducing the damage of this deadly virus. Ahmadi et al. (2021) used the capabilities of artificial intelligence to provide an extended pandemic model for estimating the COVID-19 epidemic and assessing its risks. They presented a generalized logistics growth model (LGM) to estimate COVID-19 outbreak sub-waves in Iran. Nasirpour et al. (2021) used multivariate spatial autoregressive (MSAR) to investigate the relationship between solar activity and COVID-19 and to predict possible future viruses.
Artificial intelligence technology tries to improve the efficiency of the management process during the crisis response. Baryannis et al. (Baryannis et al. 2019) conducted a comprehensive review of the SC literature that addresses problems relevant to SCRM using approaches within the range of artificial intelligence. To this end, they conducted

1 3

79416
research on different definitions and classifications of SC risk and related concepts such as uncertainty. Then, a mapping study was performed to categorize the existing literature based on the AI method used, from mathematical programming to machine learning and big data analysis, and the specific SCRM task they address. Their research points out that while risk management is fraught with challenges, identifying sources of risk-related information is one of the primary concerns.
This type of data shows the importance of text-mining, a subset of artificial intelligence in analyzing SC risk data. Text-mining, also known as text data mining, transforms unstructured text into a structured format to identify meaningful patterns and new insights. In text-mining, descriptive and predictive analyzes can be used (Dang and Ahmad 2014). Typical text-mining tasks include the following:
· Text categorization and clustering, · Concept/entity extraction, · Association rule mining, · Sentiment analysis, · Document summarization, · Visualization, · Entity-relation modeling (i.e., learning relations between
named entities).
For example, Chiu and Lin (2018) merged text-mining and Kansei Engineering (Nagamachi 1995) to derive Kansi's descriptive terms based on actual customer surveys and use it to predict the design of a consumer-preferred product while reducing the specific repetitive tasks of designers. The accuracy of traditional text-mining in the analysis of texts, especially texts with complex meanings, is very low because it cannot use the semantic information of the text effectively (Hu and Zhang 2010).
Ontology can extract key concepts and inter-relation and thus provide a common understanding of a domain. Combining these two techniques can obtain accurate text-mining analysis (Hu and Zhang 2010). Elbattah et al. combined domain ontology and text analytics techniques to analyze data in healthcare (Elbattah et al. 2021). Text-mining is also used to access knowledge about patents, known as patent knowledge retrievals. Liu et al. proposed a function-based patent knowledge retrieval tool for the conceptual design of innovative products.
These previous studies show that the emerging field of text-mining can turn natural language into practical results, gain new insights, manage information loads, and use artificial intelligence in decision-making. One research area in which text-mining has been widely used is the SC. The advent of modern information technologies such as IoT, big data, blockchain, and artificial intelligence have created new opportunities for efficient SC management. For

example, Akundi et al. gathered information from various textual sources (e.g., tweets, news, and other social media) to understand how textual data about a given smartphone could affect its SC and management (Akundi et al. 2018). Mayer et al. examined how text-mining could provide insights into the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on SCs, focusing on epidemic consequences for SC structures related to risk, flexibility, and sustainability (Dowling et al. 2019). They showed that some SC topics, such as risk, flexibility, disruption, and consistency, differ in their news coverage on the type of newspaper and the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections.
Aday and Aday (2020) evaluated the impact of COVID19 on the agri-food sector. They summarized the recommendations needed to reduce and control the effects of the pandemic by using textual report analysis. Su and Chen (2018) developed a Twitter-enabled supplier status assessment tool to improve supplier selection. They applied text-mining on Twitter tweets to retrieve supplier-related information and analyze potential risks and uncertainty. They used textmining in Twitter tweets to retrieve supplier information and analyze risks and potential uncertainties. They applied text-mining on Twitter tweets to retrieve supplier-related information and analyze potential risks and uncertainty. The proposed method was proven to improve the efficiency and accuracy of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) commodity risk evaluation.
Research gap
Numerous qualitative methods have been developed to analyze the effects of the crisis on the SC and related risks, such as fuzzy cognitive maps (Bevilacqua et al. 2020), fuzzy AHP approach (Nazam et al. 2020), pattern matching technique (Köksal et al. 2018), analytic network process (Martino et al. 2017), explorative qualitative study (Kam et al. 2011), qualitative survey approach (Moon et al. 2010), and Delphi method (Cerruti and Delbufalo 2009). Many of these methods have validation challenges due to limited samples (Ponis and Ntalla, 2016). On the other hand, qualitative methods based on human judgments have raised concerns about possible biases (Giannakis and Papadopoulos 2016).
Today, large amounts of SC crisis data are available as text-based information from social networks, open portals, and databases for academic purposes. In this regard, new research has been directed toward data-driven methods, a text analysis approach to monitoring SC crises and understanding risk patterns (Yan et al. 2019; Chu et al. 2019; Shah et al. 2021; Kara et al. 2020; Da Silva et al. 2020).
However, due to the nature of risk data, which are complex, ambiguous, and contradictory, pure data mining methods do not meet the required precision, effectiveness, and efficiency; and even may mislead (Wang and Ye 2018). In

Our proposed framework is based on the thematic analysis combined with text-mining methods (Braun and Clarke 2006; Guest et al. 2012). According to Fig. 2, the framework consists of three main layers:
· "Data gathering" on related topics; · "Pre-processing" to reduce noise and data preparation; · "Knowledge discovery" to analyze and extract knowledge
in an interaction with the user.
The layers are explained in the following subsections.
Data gathering layer
The data gathering layer collects data from data sources, generally web pages and social media posts. This layer contains one component for data collection and delivers

the collected data to the next layer, pre-processing layer. Although data sources are in different formats, e.g., text, image, voice, and video, we focus on the text format because natural language processing techniques are more mature than processing other formats. Since only the text sources are considered in the proposed platform, this layer prepares the data in the form of a text corpus for the pre-processing layer. This research focused on identifying the impacts of natural crises on the food SC. Therefore, the data sources include newsletters, reports, and events on food, risks, logistics, freight, operations, regulations, and technology.
Preprocessing layer
In Fig. 2, the pre-processing layer receives the corpus from the data gathering layer. It prepares some transformed corpus forms for other processes in the knowledge discovery layer. As shown in the pseudo-code of Fig. 3, this layer contains four components to perform four actions on the corpus and prepare transferred forms of the corpus, correspondingly:
· Normalized_corpus creation: This component removes all URLs, stop words (e.g., "a," "an," "them," "it"), and special characters (e.g., HTML and XML tags) from the text. Furthermore, this component replaces lemmatized form of every word; therefore, the words with the same base also have the same form.

Fig.3Pseudo-code for the Pre-processing

· Tokenized_corpus creation: This component splits the input corpus into its constituent tokens, chunks of information that can be considered discrete elements with a useful semantic unit for processing.
· Word2Vec Model generation: This component generates the Word2Vec model of the corpus, which is used in the knowledge discovery layer to identify similar terms.
· Corpus_sentences creation: Sentences are considered knowledge units (KUs) in the proposed framework. Therefore, this component divides the corpus into separate sentences.
Knowledge discovery layer
The core part of the framework is the knowledge discovery layer, which provides a user-system interaction facility to extract knowledge iteratively. As shown in Fig. 2, this layer consists of three component groups: crisis KM handling, crisis query handling, and knowledge extraction/evaluation. Figure 4 shows the corresponding pseudo-code of this layer. More details are described below.
Crisis knowledge map handling
As discussed in the "Literature review and related works" section, KM is represented as a network whose nodes are terms from the tokenized corpus, and the links are the meaningful relations between the nodes. The KM is created based on a top-down network of terms. The user could select any term from any level to be expanded into more related terms at the next level as co-occurrence terms. This component group comprises LDA_Cluster Visualization, Expand_KM, and Visualize_KM.
LDA_Cluster visualization To create a KM, it is necessary to extract important topics in the whole corpus as key terms. These key terms, which form the first level of the KM, are selected by the user with the assistance of topic modeling and visualization of clusters. At the first step, the KM is initialized to a single node, root_node (line 5 of Fig. 4). Then, clusters are identified using LDA (line 6 of Fig. 4) and visualized as word clouds (lines 7-9 of Fig. 4). Afterward, level 1 of KM is constructed, adding the terms selected by the

user from the visualized clusters to the initialized KM with the associated links to the root_node (lines 10-14 of Fig. 4). Level 1 of KM is shown to the user for further expansion of the KM (line 15 of Fig. 4).
Expand_KM After creating the first level of KM, in this step, each selected term (which is called key_term) expands to a subset of relevant terms, called co-occurrence terms, at lower levels in KM. This operation is repeated for each selected term in each layer and expands to lower layers based on user preferences until the user stops the expansion operation. This is shown in the pseudo-code of Fig. 3. The main part of the program is the iterative loop, located on lines 16-26. The algorithm then uses the Expand_KM procedure to expand this expression to co-occurrence terms at the lower layer. The operation of Expand_KM component is shown as the Expand_KM procedure (lines 28-36 of Fig. 4).
The Expand_KM procedure performs three main actions: (1) extracting context terms, (2) filtering unnecessary terms, and (3) extending the knowledge map.
Extracting context terms At first, it extracts context terms using Extract_Context_Terms function, in which the context_terms and the number of their occurrences are extracted. The context terms are terms in the neighbor of the central selected key_term in the win_size range throughout the tokenized_corpus. The context terms and their relationship to the key term and the window size range are shown in Fig. 5.
Filtering unnecessary terms As the second action, Expand_ KM filters unnecessary terms. Therefore, the co_occurrence_terms are extracted as a key_term expansion in the KM. These co-occurrence terms are a subset of context terms that have a meaningful relationship with the key term and have not been randomly placed in the neighbor of the key term. In order to extract co-occurrence terms, two filtering operations are applied to context_terms to remove unnecessary terms: based on the TFIDF threshold and based on the phi threshold.
The TFIDF threshold filter (line 30 of Fig. 4) calculates the TFIDF parameter of the context_terms obtained from the previous step and removes terms whose TFIDF values

are less than the TTFIDF threshold tuned by the user (line

18 of Fig. 4). After filtering operation in this step, the most

important terms from freq_terms are extracted and stored in

the imp_terms (important terms) variable.

The second filter, the phi filter, is based on the phi coef-

ficient threshold. The phi coefficient is used to measure

the correlation of important terms with the key term. As

shown in line 31 of Fig. 4, in this filter, imp_terms obtained

from the previous step whose  values are not within the

phi threshold (Tphi) are removed in this step. The remaining

terms of the filtering operation are stored in the co_occur_

terms variable. Table 1 shows the required values for cal-

culating the  parameter of words X and Y in a document.

In Table 1, ­n11 represents the number of documents that contain both the words X and Y, n00 represents the number of documents that contains none of them, and n10 equals the number of documents containing X and do not contain Y, and

similarly, n01 equals the number of documents containing Y and does not contain X. The total values are also shown in

the table, n equals the number of all documents. Equation 5

shows the calculation of the coefficient  to obtain the cor-

relation between the words X and Y in Table 1.





= n11n00 - n10n01  n1.n0.n.0n.1

(5)

The correlation coefficient  varies from-1 to+1. The value of+1 indicates the maximum agreement, the value of-1 indicates the disagreement, and the value of 0 shows no relationship.

Extending the knowledge map As the third action of Expand_KM, all the terms are considered as nodes, and also their relation with the key term from which they are expanded is stored to create and visualize a KM. Each term in the co_occur_terms variable is added to the KM.nodes as

a node, and the relation between this node and the key term from which it is generated is stored in the KM.links variable (lines 32-35 of Fig. 4).
Visualize_KM This component is used to visualize the relationship between key terms and their co-occurrence terms. This operation is shown in the Visualize_KM component in Fig. 2. After expanding the knowledge map in the previous step, the nodes and the relationships between the nodes are saved in KM variable (containing KM.nodes for nodes and KM.links for links). The Visualize_KM function visualizes the knowledge map for the user (line 20 of Fig. 4).
Crisis query handling
Enrich_Query To extract the relevant KUs, it is necessary to have a proper query. To create a suitable query, finding the correlated terms in the relevant knowledge domain is essential. The KM created in the previous step expresses the relationship between terms in a (tree-like) directed

acyclic graph. The query is a traverse of terms from root_ node to a leaf node in the KM network selected by the user. The request extracted from KM may not include all aspects, and it may be necessary to add or remove concepts. For this purpose, the query is sent to the Enrich_ Query component for enrichment (Fig. 2). This operation is presented by the pseudo-code of the simulation in Fig. 4. In line 21 of the pseudo-code by the Get_Query function, the algorithm gets the query that the user has created from the KM and puts it in the query variable. In line 22 of the pseudo-code, the Enrich_Query function creates an enriched query. Details of the Enrich_Query function are shown in lines 37-47 of the pseudo-code. Due to the algebraic ability in word embedding to add and remove terms, we used "+" and "-" signs to add and remove concepts (terms) to create s suitable query. Two variables, positive_terms and negative_terms, are initialized (line 38). The terms that the user puts in the positive_terms variable are the concepts to be added, and the terms he puts in the negative_terms variable are those to be removed. In lines 39 to 45 of the pseudo-code, the user decides which terms to be added to each variable. The related mathematical operation is:
qi = argmax (q . (qp - qn)) (6) qV
where qp represents the "sum of positive terms vector" and qn represents the "sum of negative terms vectors." The system extracts qi for enriching query from the vocabulary V (the set of unique words used in the text corpus). This

operation is performed by finding the term with maximum angular similarity to the vocabulary vector (expressed as vector dot product, assuming all term vectors have the same length).

The user selects some terms in the Similar_Term variable as selected_Similar_Term to enrich the query, as shown in line 48 of pseudo-code of Fig. 4. To create an enriched query, selected_Similar_Term is added to positive_terms to create an enriched_query variable, as shown in line 49 of pseudocode in Fig. 4. As a result, mathematically qi (enriched query vectors) are created according to Eq. 7. The query enrichment operation is shown in the framework presented in Fig. 6.

qi = qp + qi

(7)

Knowledge extraction/evaluation
Extract_KU After creating a user-interested crisis query, the Extract_KU component of Fig. 2 extracts the most similar KUs to the query. KUs are the most similar corpus sentences to enriched queries representing knowledge propositions. The KUs extracted by the machine allow the analyst to make a hypothesis about the crisis. It also steers the analyst's subsequent searches to select appropriate key terms. It is necessary to convert text words into numerical quantities to conduct calculations on queries and KUs. We have used the word2vec algorithm, which processes text by vectorizing the words.

Each SC document (SCi;i = 1, 2, ... , m) consists of n numbers of terms t1, t2, t3, ... tn representing the spatial-temporal information of an SC. The basic idea is to extract unique content-bearing terms from the set of SC documents and afterward assign weight to every term based on the product of term frequency and inverse document frequency (TFIDF). Consequently, these terms should be treated as a numerical representation of the features of the similarity algorithm.
Therefore, we have represented an SC document (SCi) through the d-dimensional feature vector in the term space as SCi = W1t1, W2t2, W3t3, ... Wntn; where W is the weight assigned to each term tj in the SC document as:

Wn = Frq tj, SCi  IDF

(8)

where Frq tj, FSCi is the frequency of the term (j) in a SC document (i) and IDF is the inverse document frequency calculated as:

frequency of tj in each SC (SCi). IDFtj is the reverse fre-
quency of documents that include tj, and m is the total number of terms in each sentence. A fixed value has been added to prevent the denominator from becoming zero.
However, we used cosine similarity as the distance function in the similarity calculation between queries and KUi according to Eq. 11, and then KUs will be ranked accordingly.

Similarity(q, KUi) = q.KUiq  KUi

(11)

Figure 4 shows the simulation code of the above operation. In line 23, The Extract_KU function takes the two parameters enriched_query and corpus_sentences, extracts a list of sentences (KUs) from corpus_sentences, and ranks them based on their similarity enriched_query.

IDF = 1 + log Total number of SC documentsNumber of SC documents containing the tj

(9)

The numerical representation of the SC sentences vector (KUs vector) was thus represented through these weighted

SC terms. Equation 10 shows the equivalent formal mathematical description for sentence vector:

The Extract_KU function takes two parameters, enriched_query, and corpus_sentences, extracts a list of the most similar sentences in corpus_sentences to enriched_ query and ranks them by their similarity values.
Evaluate_KU After extracting the crisis KUs, it is necessary to evaluate the information value of these KUs to create a hypothesis or knowledge with high validity. To determine the information value of the extracted KUs, first, a similarity diagram is created between the query and each crisis KU, as

shown in Fig. 7. As can be seen in this diagram, the gradient of the curve is severely broken in some places. Each break in the gradient could be interpreted as the border between two separate clusters (C1 to C5 in Fig. 7). Therefore, for each cluster Cj, the information value of cluster c, IV cj , is measured by Eq. 12.

Case analysis
In this section, to evaluate the framework operation, we have implemented it and ran a case to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the SC.
Data collection and preprocessing
In this case study, we collected a large unstructured volume of SC crisis reports1 from professional websites, including Supply Chain 24/7,2 Supply Chain Quarterly,3 Supply Chain Dive,4 Supply Chain Management Review,5 SupplyChainDigest,6 Supply Chain Digital,7 SupplyChainDigest,8 and Commercial Risk online9 by using the crawling technique. These websites include analytical reports and articles focusing on the supply chain in logistics, transportation, operations, logistics, regulation, technology, and risk. The topics of the articles and the titles of the interviews prepared by analysts and managers of various industries show that these information sources can be suitable for the input to the presented framework. Many of the mentioned news websites have tagged reports on numerous topics in the field of SC crisis, which significantly have facilitated access to the information we are interested in for this case.

these websites, terms such as "supply chain crisis," "supply chain risk AND management," "supply chain crisis AND COVID-19 impact," and "supply chain AND pandemic impact" were searched between the years 2019 and 2022. As a result, 1024 analytical reports on the supply chain crisis were collected. Severe inspections were carried out to remove repeated and irrelevant documentation. Finally, 975 articles have been determined to be suitable for further analysis. Then, we cleaned up and pre-processed these data to remove irrelevant information and prepare them for analysis. After the normalization operation, 30 commonly used terms in the SC corpus were extracted, shown in Table 2. The resultant corpus contains 975 reports with 631,799 terms and 31,864 unique term forms. The most effective and meaningful terms in the corpus have been shown in Table 2.
LDA_cluster visualization
We applied topic modeling to the analytical reports using the LDA_Cluster, and the reports were divided into five clusters with different topics. Figure 8 shows the word clouds of the clusters, highlighting the most important terms in each cluster. One of the important terms of each cluster was selected by the user to create the first layer of KM. These selected terms are as follows: "food retail," "food service," "manufacturing," "consumer," and "logistics," which are used to create the first layer of the KM.
Knowledge map expansion
After constructing the first layer of the KM, the user could select any of the terms of the first layer as the key term for KM expansion. First, context_terms were extracted

throughout the corpus in the win_size range. In this case study, we set the win_size to 20 for all steps; however, the user can assign any other values to it based on his insight. In the next step, two filtering operations were applied to all extracted context_terms:
· TFIDF filtering: The TFIDF of each context term was calculated and normalized to the 0-1 range. The terms whose TFIDF was less than the threshold value of 0.65 (set by the user) were ignored. The user determines the TFIDF threshold based on the field of study and context of analysis. The important context_terms for the selected key term were obtained at the end of this step.
· Phi filtering: Table 3 shows the values of parameter  calculated for the most important context terms. The boldfaced values identify the terms with negative  values, which are the terms that do not have a logical relationship with the key terms and should be ignored.
At the end of the filtering operation, the co-occurrence terms of a key term selected by the user were obtained. These co-occurrence terms are the most important terms that semantically describe the key term (about the impact of COVID on the supply chain) concerned by the user. For example, as Table 3 shows, the terms "shopping," "users," "law," "spending," "behavior," "respondent," "enforcement," "food," "eating" and "crisis" were extracted as the context of "consumer" key term after filtering step.
Visualize_KM
In this component, the relationship between the key term and the context_terms was displayed in a KM. As shown in

Fig. 9, all selected terms are derived from topic modeling (e.g., "food retail," "food service," "manufacturing," "consumer," and "logistics") at level 1 of the KM were considered. Also, the resulting context_terms at the lower level are linked to the upper key term, respectively. For example, according to the KM in Fig. 9, the terms "products" and "supply" are the underlying terms for the key term "demand," which are attached to it in the KM.
Enrich_Query
Table 4 shows some details on query enrichment in the case we ran. The user selected the query "food retail+online" considering the KM to discover knowledge propositions throughout the corpus that define the relationship between "food retail" and "online" in times of crisis. For this purpose, terms related to this query were proposed by the Enrich_Query component to extract more relevant KUs. In the Enrich_Query component, the analogy rate of all terms in the corpus with the initial query was calculated using word embedding.
The analogy rate of the terms "channels," "business," "impact," "COVID," "consumer," "shopping," "frequency," "performer," and "company" to "food retail" was higher than others. Therefore, these terms were suggested as terms that could enrich the query. Three terms "channels," "impact," and "consumer," shown in boldface, were selected from the terms suggested by the query enrichment component. Similar operations were performed for "food retail+worker," "food service+sector" and "consumer+behavior" queries, as demonstrated in Table 4.
Table 5 shows the enrichment of the query in terms of removing some concepts from the key term. Based on the KM in Fig. 9, COVID-19 has influenced the "logistics" part.

Fig.9Crisis terms knowledge map

One of the lower layer terms of this key term is "management." The "logistics-management" query aims to examine the effects of COVID-19 on "logistics" without considering management concepts. Therefore, as shown in Table 5, the terms "truck," "freight," "impact," "sea," "consumer," "transportation," "frequency," "congestion," and "company," which are more similar to this query and can enrich it, have been extracted. From the obtained terms, the terms "truck," "freight," "sea," "consumer," and "transportation" were selected for enrichment.
The terms vector with a higher analogy rate to the query is closer to the query vector than the other terms vector. In Fig. 10, the relationship between the two-dimensional representation of the query vector "food retail+online" and the term vector "channel; business; impact; COVID; consumer" is shown as an example.
Knowledge extraction/evaluation
Based on the created query, KUs were extracted from the corpus. Then, the information value of each KU was calculated, and the most valuable KUs were extracted. The resultant evaluated KUs are shown in Fig. 11, and the details of extracting them are described below:
· The query was selected as "food service+sector+restaurant." After enriching the query, the resulting query was extracted as "food service+sector+restaurant+home+producer."
· According to the percentage of IVs for each cluster, shown as a pie chart, with total values of 43%, 40%, 15%, and 2%, clusters 1 to 3 have more significant IVs with

14 KUs. A set of KUs focusing on the enriched query revealed that the effects of the COVID-19 on the food service industry have been significant. A set of KUs showed that COVID-19 had greater influence over downstream retail and food service sectors, mostly informal SMEs. · Another constructed query was the "food retail+online." Query enrichment operation was performed. The resulting query has been extracted as "food retail+online+channel+impact+consumer." The graph of "Similarity value of extracted KU with the query" has five different clusters. The percentage of IV in each cluster is 52%, 25%, 16%, 6%, and 1%. Clusters 1 to 4 have high IV values and include 14 KUs. Some of the extracted KUs are shown in the output evaluated in the figure. · A set of KUs focusing on the query of "Food retail+online" showed that due to the pandemic crisis and the desire to minimize contact between people, we had faced an increase in online food shopping, and it is likely that the online channel may become an integral part of food shopping. A set of KUs showed that increased prices imposed by online platforms could lead to inequality in access to food. · Another query was the "food retail+worker." After enriching the query, the resulting query was extracted as "food retail+worker+company+impact+safety." The graph of "similarity value of extracted KU with the query" has six different clusters. The percentage of IV of each cluster is 42%, 20%, 13%, 19%, 5%, and 1%, respectively. Clusters 1 to 5 have high IV, which include 14 KU. The extracted KUs showed that supermarket chains are already facing an increasing demand for workers and

workers receiving low wages and inadequate social security benefits. · Based on the KM, a query was created as "consumer+behavior," focusing on the term "consumer" as a key term. According to the percentage of IVs of each cluster regarding the total value, 42%, 38%, 18%, and 2%, clusters 1 to 3 have significant IVs, including 12 KUs. The extracted KUs are shown in the evaluated output in the figure. According to the KUs extracted based on a query, it is clear that the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its impact has led to an increase in food health-conscious behavior. By selecting the query as "consumer+behavior+restaurant," it was found that customers of restaurants and shopping malls have fallen sharply. Also, by creating a query called "consumer+behavior+buying," the extracted KUs show that consumer buying behavior has become more erratic. Due to the pandemic crisis, the use of digital tools in customers' buying patterns has increased and will probably continue after this crisis. Online food ordering has increased dramatically, and the desire to buy healthy products has increased among consumers. KUs, by focusing on "shop," and selecting the query as "consumer+behavior+shop," show that traditional consumers increasingly use the frictionless shopping method during the pandemic era. At the same time, several extracted KUs show that fast delivery of food by farm shops is an advantage, while during the pandemic, stores have not been able to cope with the high demand of customers. · The query "logistic-management" was selected. To construct a suitable query, all terms similar to the "logistic-management" expression have been used to modify the query. The resulting query has been extracted as "freight+truck+sea+transportation." According to the IV percentage of clusters, 1 to 3 have significant IVs, 31%, 29%, 28%, 10%, and 2%, respectively. Some of the extracted KUs are shown in the figure. · Based on the search for KUs focusing on "logisticmanagement," several KUs were extracted, implying that due to the increase in inspections of shipments, logistics costs have increased to comply with border control protocols during the pandemic. Also, based on the KUs extracted with the focus on "logistic-management+freight+truck+sea," this hypothesis was obtained that, in the ocean freight sector, due to the emerged crisis, sailing programs are subject to disruption, and ports and terminals are facing equipment imbalances. Operational restrictions have also led to delays in the delivery of goods, congestion, and rising final prices. · Another selected query was the "manufacture+operation." The enriched query "manufacture+operation+plants+products+demand+packaging" was constructed based on this query. The evaluated KUs

show that clusters 1 to 3 have significant IVs, 45%, 32%, 21%, and 2%, respectively. The extracted KUs based on this query showed that sales of plant-based products had increased drastically during the pandemic. In the KUs discovered with the terms "demand+packaging" in the lower layers of the KM, the obtained KUs showed that food suppliers faced a sudden increase in sales, during the pandemic, due to the increased demand of consumers for packaged and processed foods. The demand for food robotics has also increased, emphasizing social distancing considerations.
Discussion
The main goal of this study was to apply the KM and NLP techniques to identify the effects of natural crises on the SC. To achieve this goal, we proposed and implemented a framework. After applying topic modeling and analyzing word frequency and co-occurrences on 975 analytical reports related to the effects of the natural crisis on the SC, a KM of the five main related topics was created and expanded. This study used the KM (or co-occurrence network) of risk terms to derive and categorize 53 knowledge

propositions, which express the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on essential parts of the SC in a categorized manner.
The extracted categorized KUs from user-system interactions could be used to inform industry experts, governments, and academic researchers about the various effects of natural crises on the SC. Natural crises are disruptive and affect SC performance. Therefore, effective SC crisis monitoring is necessary to reduce costs and increase the organization's sustainability in the long term. The proposed framework can help organizations automatically develop and expand a hierarchical KM of crisis effects. In addition, they can target critical issues judged by analysts to monitor risks, identify threats, and determine a corrective or protective course of action. The extracted terms of SC crises make a dictionary of crises that can be used to create a suitable query to extract knowledge propositions from analytical reports related to various SC crises.
The resultant KM and KUs show five sectors of the pandemic's impact: (1) food retail, (2) food services, (3) manufacture, (4) consumer, and (5) logistics, briefly described as follows:
· In the consumer sector: The consumption patterns have been changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fig.11Evaluated knowledge units outputs

· In the manufacturing sector: The consumer demands have been increased for packaged and processed foods; robots have been more used in the production process; and healthier materials such as vegetables, fresh, and healthier foods have been more produced.
· In the logistic sector: Due to the increase in inspections of shipments, logistics costs have increased to comply with border control protocols during the pandemic.
· In the food retail and the food services sectors: Various aspects have been affected by the pandemic crisis, such as increased demand for workers in supermarkets, drastic changes in consumption patterns, and food ordering. Providing such categorized knowledge propositions as a decision support system can assist SC analysts in using such a KM in short and long-term decisions in similar natural crises.

By using text-mining capability in categorizing large volumes of data, this research solves the problem of validation of qualitative methods in crisis factors analysis. On the other hand, using human intelligence in steering textmining algorithms to correct the obtained results has solved the problems in text analysis methods to analyze complex crisis data in related research.
Conclusion
The main goal of this research is to propose a text-analysisbased framework using co-occurrence term analysis and knowledge map construction to analyze a large volume of textual data, retrieved from websites and social media, concerning crisis effects on supply chains (SCs).

We implemented the proposed framework, and to validate the framework, we conducted a case study of the effects of COVID-19 on SCs. For this purpose, 975 online analytical reports on related topics were gathered and cleaned as a corpus. Then, data pre-processing operations were performed to prepare the data for further processing. And finally, using topic modeling, term frequency, and co-occurrence analysis, a set of analytical reports related to the effects of natural crises on the SC was analyzed. By textual analysis, 53 crisis knowledge propositions were extracted from 25,272 sentences in the corpus. Also, a knowledge map was created by co-occurrence analysis from 631,799 terms and 31,864 unique terms that identify the relationship between the 110 main crisis factors.
Using the implemented framework, a KM of crisis effects and a dictionary of crisis factors on the SC were created in five sectors: (1) food retail, (2) food services, (3) manufacture, (4) consumer, and (5) logistics. This KM made it possible to create a suitable query for extracting categorized SC crisis knowledge. This categorization can improve the decision-makers' knowledge in dealing with SC crises.
According to an expert panel, the categorized KUs have well monitored and reported the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on the SC in various sectors. In this research, using the implemented framework, we created a crisis KM and related knowledge extraction through user steering to identify the effects of the natural crisis on the SC.
Theoretical implication
This paper addresses two main research gaps. First, much research has been done to identify SC crises based on qualitative methods. These methods, in addition to sample limitations, are subject to human biases and judgments that cause results to be questionable. For example, survey data in research by Giannakis et al. (2016), based on human judgments, raise concerns about possible biases. Second, datadriven research has been conducted by analyzing large volumes of data to minimize the problem of data limitations and human judgments. These methods analyze the data using conventional text analysis methods, regardless of the nature of the risk (Wang and Ye 2018; Kara et al. 2020; Ganesh and Kalpana 2022). Risk data are ambiguous, complex, and have multiple meanings; thus, one risk term may fall into different sectors (Pai et al. 2003; Chiu and Choi 2016). Mere text analysis methods cannot make this distinction and require human steering (Jin et al. 2018; Chu et al. 2020).
Our proposed method could be helpful to address both mentioned gaps. Since our method applies text-mining algorithms to analyze a large volume of SC crisis data, the sample limitation could be addressed. Moreover, our proposed method is based on user-system interactions; therefore, the

Environmental Science and Pollution Research (2022) 29:79413-79433
complexity and vagueness of data could be resolved due to user feedback. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has used this method for risk analysis, including analyzing the effects of natural crises on the SC and to be used in decision support systems.
Thus, very briefly, this study significantly extends the existing literature on understanding the effects of the crisis on SC in two aspects: (1) using large volume of data and therefore resolving the sample limitation in the qualitative method and (2) enhancing the analysis performance, benefitting from the user steering in the framework.
Practice implications
SC crisis monitoring framework could be useful for both firms and governments. The firms could use this framework for their business continuity, and governments could use it for their effective policymaking (O'Rourke 2014). The current literature shows how specific decision-making processes before, during, and after a crisis can improve a company's SC performance (Dayton and Bernhardsdottir 2010). The development of information networks has enabled companies to access and analyze crisis information transparently. Companies can make decisions and take action using crisis data analysis instead of evidence-based speculation (Jin et al. 2018; McAfee et al. 2012). Data analysis is used for various operations such as procurement, service, production, warehousing, and demand management in SC management. For instance, Nguyen et al. discussed using metadata in SC management (Nguyen et al. 2015).
Considering the importance of SC crisis management, this study proposes a framework for monitoring and analyzing crisis data and establishing a crisis decision support system for firms, enabling them to respond appropriately to crises that disrupt SC performance. This framework combines human skills with text analysis techniques to provide efficient crisis data management, categorized related knowledge, and evidence-based decision-making.
Policy implication
Applying this framework can also be very useful for government policymakers to provide effective policies to support consumer services and maintain the continuity of the business market. Natural crises are often characterized by rapid expansion and affect different parts of the SC (Natarajarathinam et al. 2009); therefore, governments pursue prudent policies to limit its spread (Barnes and Oloruntoba 2005). Given the impact of these policies on the performance of all parts of the SC, creating a categorized knowledge database about the SC crisis can enhance policymakers' knowledge to make more effective policies (Miroudot 2020). The large

1 3

Environmental Science and Pollution Research (2022) 29:79413-79433
amount of data generated in information networks about SC crises has created a good opportunity for government policymakers to make evidence-based policies instead of intuition (Newig et al. 2016). Therefore, one of the objectives of this study is to propose a new decision support system that can guide policymakers through the analysis of crisis data and the creation of classified knowledge to create policies for SC crisis management. The extracted pieces of knowledge are used to inform advice, monitor, evaluate, and revise the decisions made by policymakers.
Limitations and future research
There are several limitations in the study which could be addressed in future research. First, the KM of crisis does not discover the type of relationship between crisis terms. Crisis terms are related to each other, and identifying these relationships can be very useful in constructing the appropriate queries. Second, the subject was limited to social media reports for analysis in the data collection phase. This is just for the purpose of representing the operation of the proposed framework. Various automation systems such as enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management in companies collect very important applicable data related to financials, SC, operations, commerce, reporting, manufacturing, and human resource activities that should be considered in the analysis.
Hence, future developments of this research could focus on two aspects. First, it could focus on the analysis of dependencies among various crisis factors. Understanding the relationship between different types of crises significantly improves supply chain crisis classification and management. This can be achieved by creating ontology between the crisis factors. Secondly, for crisis analysis of various crisis data types such as automation systems, the future extension could focus on creating data analysis rules, identifying thresholds, and mapping the results to identify crisis factors in the supply chain.

Are we sure that the neurological impact of COVID 19 in childhood has not been underestimated?
Nicola Principi1 and Susanna Esposito2*

Abstract
Background: Presently, it is known that, even if less frequently than in adults, children can develop a severe new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Children with the SARS-CoV-2 infection can have neurological signs and symptoms of disease more frequently than previously thought, revealing the involvement of the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system, or both. Aim of this manuscript is to highlight the neurologic complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 among pediatric patients with COVID-19, suggesting when to monitor carefully neurologic development.
Main findings: Children with a severe chronic underlying disease, infants and toddlers and those who develop the so-called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) are those with the highest incidence of neurological complications. Fortunately, in most of the cases, neurological manifestations, mainly represented by headache and anosmia, are mild and transient and do not significantly complicate the COVID-19 course. However, in some cases, very severe clinical problems associated with relevant alterations of neuroimaging, electroencephalography, nerve conduction studies and electromyography findings can develop. Generally, almost all the children with COVID-19 and neurological manifestations till now described have made a complete recovery, although in some cases this has occurred after several weeks of treatment. Moreover, COVID-19 infection during pregnancy has been found associated with an increased risk of obstetric complications that can lead to neurological acute and long-term manifestations in neonates.
Conclusions: Based on data showing the neurologic impact of COVID-19 in pediatric age, we suggest monitoring neurological development a few months after healing in pediatric patients who have presented MIS-C, seizures or other neurological manifestations and in children of pregnant women with COVID-19 in order to detect overt and subtle deficits.

Background In the first months of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, results of several epidemiological studies had led to the conclusion that, compared to adults, children were less susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and that, when infected, they remained more frequently asymptomatic or developed a mild disease [1-3]. Most of the symptomatic children had only minor respiratory or gastrointestinal problems. Moreover, the risk of hospitalization and the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission was found very low and death was an exceptional event [4, 5]. These findings explain why pediatric COVID-19 was initially considered a minor clinical problem.
However, with the prolongation of the pandemic and a more accurate evaluation of a greater number of children, this belief was, at least in part, changed. Presently, it is known that, even if less frequently than in adults, children can develop a severe COVID-19. At higher risk are subjects with severe underlying medical conditions, younger children and those that develop the so-called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) [1, 6]. Moreover, the review of the clinical picture of pediatric COVID-19 has shown that its impact extends beyond the pulmonary morbidity and mortality of the disease. More frequently than previously thought, children with the SARS-CoV-2 infection can have neurological signs and symptoms of disease, revealing the involvement of the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system (PNS), or both [1]. Their presence has prognostic significance and their impact could be fully clarified after many years of careful follow-up, and not only in the acute and subacute phase of the infection [1].
Aim of this manuscript is to highlight the neurologic complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 among pediatric patients with COVID-19, suggesting when to monitor carefully neurologic development.
Neurologic complications associated to COVID-19 in pediatric age Children with a severe chronic underlying disease, infants and toddlers and those who develop the so-called MIS-C are those with the highest incidence of neurological complications [7-9]. A systematic review and meta-analyses of studies involving about 3700 pediatric COVID-19 patients have shown that 17% of them had nonspecific neurologic conditions and 1% had signs and symptoms of severe brain involvement [7]. In MIS-C patients, the incidence of abnormal neurological findings has been reported in up to 55% of the cases [8]. Fortunately, in most of the children, neurological manifestations, mainly represented by headache and anosmia, are mild and transient and do not significantly complicate

the COVID-19 course. However, in some cases, very severe clinical problems associated with relevant alterations of neuroimaging, electroencephalography, nerve conduction studies and electromyography findings can develop. A not marginal number of encephalopathy, encephalitis, central or peripheral acute flaccid paralysis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, seizures, stroke has been diagnosed in children with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection [9].
These findings seem to confirm what have been suggested by the studies involving other human coronaviruses (hCoVs), i.e. the risk that pediatric infections due to this group of agents may be associated with the development of neurological insults and that these may lead to a significant neurodevelopmental impairment [10]. Except for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)CoV, for all the other known hCoVs neurological complications have been described. In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the risk seems further increased by the evidence that neurological manifestations can develop both during the acute phase of COVID-19 as the first signs and symptoms of disease in previously healthy children and over days to weeks after a previously asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. In both cases, diagnosis and potentially effective therapy may be severely delayed or completely missed with high risk of persistent neurologic damage.
Mechanisms that cause COVID-19-related neurologic damage Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain acute and postacute neurologic manifestations of COVID-19. Although neurologic damage can simply be the consequence of hypoxia, hypotension and liver and renal insufficiency that are characteristic of the most severe cases of COVID-19, a number of specific mechanisms are considered the main causes of CNS and PNS damage [11]. It has been supposed that SARS-CoV-2 may infect olfactory neurons and subsequently invade brainstem, basal ganglia and cortex, with a direct destructive effect [11]. Moreover, as SARS-CoV-2 depletes Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) causing a significant renin-angiotensin system disequilibrium, it is thought that, following the infection, a prothrombotic state with impaired large vessel and microvascular blood flow can occur and lead to increased risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic stroke [11]. The most important mechanism seems, however, the immune dysregulation leading to autoimmunity and the hyperinflammation [11]. Most cases occur in children with MIS-C and most neuroimaging findings resemble those detected in parainfectious and postinfectious syndromes that involve the CNS and the PNS [12].

Moreover, in some patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like magnetic resonance images, antibodies against brain components have been detected, strongly suggesting that COVID-19 can be associated with an immune-mediated pathology [13]. However, regardless of the pathophysiology, in all these cases, early identification, prompt diagnosis and careful implementation of the most effective therapeutic interventions are needed to assure the resolution of the acute disease and the potential long-term abnormalities.
Outcome of COVID-19-related neurologic complications in pediatric age Generally, almost all the children with COVID-19 and neurological manifestations till now described have made a complete recovery, although in some cases this has occurred after several weeks of treatment [7-9]. However, definitive conclusions about long-term consequences cannot be drawn due to the low number of study cases and the time-limited follow-up. On the other hand, the risk that, at least in some cases, some longterm neurological problems may persist cannot be excluded. When prognosis of the clinical conditions described in COVID-19 pediatric cases is analyzed, it can be observed that some of them can cause long-term problems [13]. An example in this regard is given by ADEM. Generally, ADEM cases have complete resolution. However, a recent meta-analysis has found that, despite a generally positive neurocognitive outcome, a reduction of intelligence quotient, attention, executive functioning, processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial skills and internalizing symptoms could persist in up to 43% subset of individuals several months after the apparent resolution of the disease [12]. This explains why experts have suggested that COVID-19 is included among the medical conditions that can potentially cause long-term neurological problems and that children with SARS-CoV-2 infection even without neurological manifestations in the acute phase of disease should be carefully monitored for a long time. To favor the early identification of potential neurodevelopmental impairment, the use of an age-related clinical practice guidance for pediatric providers treating children with SARS-CoV-2 infections has been proposed [9].
The importance of monitoring children involved in the problem of SARS-CoV-2 in-fection is further highlighted by the recently acquired evidence that infection of the pregnant women can have a relevant negative impact on the neonates [14, 15]. Maternal infections during the second and the third trimester of pregnancy have been frequently found associated with an increased risk of obstetric complications leading to preterm birth, low birth weight and several neonatal diseases, including respiratory distress syndrome, hyperbilirubinemia and

need for assistance in ICU [14]. As all these conditions can lead to neurological acute and long-term manifestations, implications of SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of neurological problems in children are significantly more important than those simply due to the direct infection of the child.
Conclusions Based on data on neurological involvement in SARSCoV-2 positive pediatric patients and on neonatal complications observed in children of pregnant women with COVID-19, we suggest monitoring neurological development a few months after healing in pediatric patients who have presented MIS-C, seizures or other neurological manifestations and in children of pregnant women with COVID-19 in order to detect overt and subtle deficits. As the focus of healthcare shifts from the `crisis', diligence, attention and multicentric collaborations will be required to ensure ongoing international collaboration in maintaining registries to monitor for possible later behavioral complications of COVID-19 in children who have being infected, even without clinical evidence of neurological signs and symptoms. In particular, it will be important to evaluate subtle neurobehavioral impairment which can be evident only many years later because of the known SARS-CoV- 2 localization in certain cerebral areas linked to neurobehavioral development skills (i.e., orbito-frontal and pre-frontal areas).
In addition, during the pandemic, the chronicrelapsing neurological pathology (i.e., epilepsy) was neglected by many families due to the fear of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 with access to the Emergency Room and being subjected to diagnostic delays related to COVID-19 before hospitalization (which often also meant strict isolation and estrangement from the family). Thus, it is crucial that management of these patients could return to previous clinical practice since this could avoid that they are admitted to the Emergency Room in extreme conditions.

Abstract
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had major impacts in many different spheres, including mental health. Children and adolescents are especially vulnerable because their central nervous system is still in development and they have fewer coping resources than do adults. Increases in the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptomatology have been reported worldwide. However, access to mental health care is limited, especially for the paediatric population and in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we developed a brief internet-delivered cognitivebehavioural intervention for children and adolescents with symptoms of anxiety and depression. The aim of this proposed study is to test the efficacy of the intervention.
Methods: We will conduct a two-arm, parallel randomised controlled trial involving children and adolescents (8-11 and 12-17 years of age, respectively) with symptoms of anxiety, depression or both, according to the 25-item Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (t-score>70). A total of 280 participants will be randomised to the intervention group or the active control group, in a 1:1 ratio. Those in the intervention group will receive five weekly sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy via teleconference. The sessions will focus on stress responses, family communication, diaphragmatic breathing, emotions, anger management, behavioural activation and cognitive restructuring. Participants in both groups will have access to 15 videos covering the same topics. Participant-guardian pairs will be expected to attend the sessions (intervention group), watch the videos (control group) or both (intervention group only). A blinded assessor will collect data on symptoms of anxiety, depression and irritability, at baseline, at the end of the intervention and 30 days thereafter. Adolescents with access to a smartphone will also be invited to participate in an ecological momentary assessment of emotional problems in the week before and the week after the intervention, as well as in passive data collection from existing smartphone sensors throughout the study.

Introduction
Background and rationale {6a} The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had major impacts on many different aspects of health, including mental health [1]. Because their brains are still in development, children could present shortand long-term physiological, cognitive and behavioural changes related to overly challenging situations such as those produced by the pandemic [2]. Their routine suffered major changes due to the restrictions imposed on school and leisure activities, leading to an increase in sedentary behaviours and screen exposure, as well as a decrease in the number of opportunities to socialise with their peers [3]. That could result in loneliness, which is associated with worse mental health outcomes and damages that can persist for years [4]. Financial losses and unemployment can increase the level of stress, as well as the frequency of anxiety, depression, substance abuse and violent behaviour, among parents, which can have an indirect effect on the mental health of the children and adolescents in the home [5, 6].
The emotional and behavioural effects that the pandemic has had on children and adolescents have been well documented [7-12]. Increases in the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptomatology have been reported in various countries, including China [13, 14], Germany [10], India [8] and the USA [15], as have increases in hyperactivity, social conflict, conduct disturbances and other behavioural changes [7, 10].
Brazil is one of the countries most severely affected by the pandemic. In May 2021, over one in four COVID19-related deaths occurred in Brazil [16]. It is also one of the countries in which schools were fully closed for an extended period of time [17]. It is estimated that approximately 4 million students dropped out of school during the pandemic in Brazil [18]. In a previous study conducted by our group [19], we found that, among children and adolescents in Brazil, one in three presented with clinical symptoms of anxiety or depression during the pandemic, and that number remained relatively stable from June 2020 to June 2021. In this context, it is vital to develop initiatives to mitigate the potential impact on this population. Some

interventions have been shown to reduce the severity of the psychopathology related to traumatic events, such interventions including trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), prolonged exposure for post-traumatic stress disorder and cognitive therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder [20]. In the paediatric population, CBT is a well-established therapy for anxiety and depression [21]. In a meta-analysis, Kramer and Landolt [22] suggested that trauma-focused interventions for children and adolescents should include psychoeducation, teaching of coping skills, parental involvement and some form of trauma exposure. The current scenario, however, presents challenges and obstacles to the implementation of such therapeutic strategies. Brazil is a country of continental proportions, with many remote areas and a limited number of mental health professionals, most of whom reside in the major metropolitan areas [23]. A huge number of children and adolescents are now in need of mental health care, which was already difficult to access before the pandemic [24, 25]. During the pandemic, fear of contamination aggravated that scenario, as did the social distancing mandates and the temporary closure of some supporting services. Fortunately, online access to mental health services has now become more common [26]. Even though most studies of telemental health care have involved adult patients, it has been shown to be applicable in the paediatric population as well [27]. Therefore, telepsychotherapy could be a valuable tool during the COVID-19 pandemic and in other contexts in the future.
We developed a brief cognitive-behavioural intervention, to be delivered online, that is focused on anxiety and depressive symptomatology in children and adolescents. We aimed to craft a structured, user-friendly manual that will be freely available and can be followed by mental health professionals with limited experience and will therefore be disseminated throughout Brazil. Here, we describe the protocol for a randomised controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of this intervention.
Objectives {7} The objective of the proposed study is to test the efficacy of a brief cognitive-behavioural intervention to be implemented via teleconference (or telephone call) with a child or adolescent, together with a guardian. In a randomised controlled trial, the efficacy of the intervention will be compared with that of a video-based psychoeducational intervention (active control). We expect the active intervention to be the more effective in reducing emotional symptoms and in improving global functionality.
Trial design {8} We will conduct a single-blind, two-arm, parallel-group, superiority randomised controlled trial. Participants will

be randomly allocated to the intervention group or to the active control group, in a 1:1 ratio.
Methods: participants, interventions and outcomes
Study setting {9} Participants from all over Brazil will be able to participate remotely. The research centre is the Institute of Psychiatry of the Hospital das Clínicas, operated by the University of São Paulo School of Medicine, in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The intervention will preferably be administered by videoconference. However, when that is not possible (due to internet connectivity issues or other problems), the sessions will be delivered by telephone.
Eligibility criteria {10} Children and adolescents with the following characteristics will be eligible to participate in the study: being between 8 and 17 years of age; living in Brazil; having a total t-score of70 on the 25-item version of the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale, parent report (RCADS-25-P) [28]; and having a total t-score70 on the RCADS-25, child report (RCADS25-C) [29]. The RCADS-25 measures the frequency of symptoms of anxiety and depression, using a 4-point Likert scale ("never", "sometimes", "often" or "always"), with subscale scores (for anxiety and depression, respectively) and an overall score. In an international consensus, the RCADS-25 was recommended as an outcome measure for anxiety and depression symptomatology in children and adolescents [30].
Participants will be excluded if there has been no contact between the child/adolescent and the guardian in the 15 days preceding the intervention; if there is not at least one parent/guardian participating in each session (intervention group) or available to watch the videos along with the child/adolescent (active control group); if the guardian is unable to understand the scales used in the assessments or the content of the interventions, according to the judgement of a clinical psychologist; or if the child/adolescent has previously been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia or intellectual disability or has clinical signs of a severe mental disorder or social condition that requires more intensive assessment and treatment, such as severe mood disorder, suicide risk, intense intra-familiar conflict or intense maltreatment victimisation, according to the judgement of a clinical psychologist. Suicidality will be assessed with the aid of the parent-report four-item composite version of the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire for Suicidal Ideation (MFQ-SI) [31, 32], which comprises the following items (marked as "not true", "sometimes true" or "true", in relation to the last two weeks): "S/he thought that life wasn't worth living"; "S/he thought about death or

Casella et al. Trials (2022) 23:899

Page 4 of 15

dying"; "S/he thought his/her family would be better off without him/her"; and "S/he thought about killing him/ herself ". Children and adolescents whose parents marked the final statement as "true" or "sometimes true" will be excluded from the study and referred for appropriate care that is more intensive. Individuals who have been treated with any psychiatric medication or psychotherapy in the last 30 days will also be excluded.
Who will take informed consent? {26a} Parents who are interested in participating in the study will complete an online screening form. If their child is considered eligible in that initial assessment, a research manager will contact them by telephone to explain the study in detail and answer any questions they might have. The informed consent form (for the parent) and the informed assent form (for the child or adolescent) will then be sent, and a videoconference with an assessor will be scheduled, to confirm the eligibility criteria and perform the baseline (T0) evaluation. The forms will be collected at the beginning of this videoconference.
Additional consent provisions for collection and use of participant data and biological specimens {26b} Participants will be asked if they agree to allow their data to be used should they choose to withdraw from the trial. We will also ask their permission for the research team to share relevant data with other people at the University of São Paulo or at regulatory agencies, where relevant. This trial will not involve the collection of biological specimens.
Interventions
Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b} Psychoeducational interventions consist of strategies to provide information and tools on how to better live and cope with a condition [33]. There is a growing body of literature on these kinds of interventions in mental health [33, 34], even within the paediatric population [34-36]. There is evidence that such interventions have beneficial effects, resulting in favourable mental health and wellbeing outcomes in adolescents with depressive symptoms [36]. The choice of a psychoeducational intervention as the comparator is therefore justified.
Intervention description {11a} Intervention group We have developed a brief standardised, manualised cognitive-behavioural intervention for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents, to be implemented by trained psychologists via teleconference or telephone call. The main focus of the sessions will be skills training, with a CBT approach that employs vocabulary

adapted to the target population. The psychotherapy programme will consist of five structured weekly sessions. The structure of each session is described in detail in the manual. Below is a brief description of the topics covered in each psychotherapy session.
- Session 1--The initial session covers the following: identification of the main symptoms and problems; psychoeducation on stress responses; strategies for improving communication within the family (e.g. defining minimal routines at home and how parents can listen to their child empathically); and relaxation and mindfulness techniques (diaphragmatic breathing exercises).
- Session 2--The second session focuses on emotion recognition and anger management. There is a psychoeducational component on emotions, covering the basic emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, surprise and anger, as well as their usefulness (e.g. motivating us to take necessary actions) and pitfalls (e.g. the potential for suffering). There is a greater emphasis on anger, exploring its physical, cognitive and behavioural components, and on strategies for coping with outbursts of anger, such as how they can be prevented and how to recover from one.
- Session 3--The third session focuses on behavioural activation, which is a technique based on the idea that avoidance behaviours exacerbate depressive symptoms. The technique is aimed at promoting adaptive behaviours that would be positively reinforced by scheduling potentially enjoyable and meaningful activities [37]. The rationale of behavioural activation is to stimulate participation. The therapist will guide the child/adolescent, with the help of a guardian, in creating a brief list of activities to be performed in the following week.
- Session 4--The aim of the fourth session is to teach the principles of cognitive restructuring. To that end, there is a psychoeducational component on what "thoughts" are, how to recognise them and the effects they might have on us, covering the basics of the cognitive model developed by Aaron T. Beck [38]. The last part of the session will focus on Socratic questioning [39].
- Session 5--The final session is aimed at revising any content of the previous sessions that was not clear to the family and providing a referral if necessary (e.g. to the public health care system if the child/adolescent is still symptomatic).
The first four sessions all have a homework component, encouraging the family to practice the strategies between sessions. Each session starts by reviewing the

Casella et al. Trials (2022) 23:899

Page 5 of 15

previous week's homework. As the focus of the intervention is on skills building, the child/adolescent and the main guardian (preferably a parent) will both be required to participate in all sessions. It is expected that parent/guardian participation will improve learning because the adult should act as a model for the child/adolescent on how (and when) to employ the techniques learned. Some of the interventions are also focused on teaching the guardians new skills (such as establishing better routines at home and listening empathically to their child).
The intervention also comprises 15 psychoeducational videos that revise and deepen the content of the sessions. Families are expected (and encouraged) to watch the videos between sessions. The topics of each video are as follows:

Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions {11b} Patients requiring a more intense type of treatment, such as individual psychotherapy or psychotropic medication, because of an increase in symptomatology (e.g. emergence of suicidal ideation), will be referred to the appropriate facility.
If a participant in the intervention group misses a session, the team will attempt to reschedule it, respecting the following criteria: no more than 4 weeks should elapse between the first and last session, and there should be at least 48 h between sessions, in order to allow families enough time to carry out the proposed homework. The fifth session can also be used to cover any topic that was missed because of participant inability to attend a previous session.

· Video 1--general information regarding the project and psychoeducation on stress responses · Video 2--parenting, communication and cooperation between family members · Video 3--diaphragmatic breathing · Video 4--a version of the diaphragmatic breathing video adapted for children · Video 5--progressive muscle relaxation · Video 6--mindfulness · Video 7--psychoeducation on emotions · Video 8--fear, sadness and anxiety · Video 9--coping with irritability · Video 10--behavioural activation · Video 11--establishing routines · Video 12--use of electronics by children and adolescents · Video 13--sleep hygiene · Video 14--cognitive restructuring · Video 15--coping with an anxiety attack
Each video is approximately 5 min in length. The families will have access to them via the COMVC smartphone application [40], which is available for Android and iOS. Videos will be made available according to the following schedule: first week, videos 1 to 6; second week, videos 7 to 9; third week, videos 10 to 13; and fourth week, videos 14 and 15.
Active control group Children and adolescents in the active control group will receive a psychoeducational intervention that consists of the same 15 videos described above. The videos will be made available through the same smartphone application and on to the same schedule described for the intervention group.

Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c} The intervention sessions will be recorded on video; 10% will be randomly selected to be watched by one of the authors of the manual, to assess therapist adherence to the protocol. Each session is described in detail in the manual, helping make the intervention more homogeneous among the various therapists of the research group. All of the therapists will receive weekly supervisory sessions led by senior psychotherapists. An assessor blinded to the allocation will register the percentage of psychoeducational videos watched by the patient and guardian.
Relevant concomitant care permitted or prohibited during the trial {11d} Participants who have, in the last 30 days, undergone any other form of psychotherapy or used any psychotropic medications will be excluded. However, those who present worsening of their symptoms during the intervention and require more intensive support (such as another form of psychotherapy and/or psychotropic medications) will be allowed to complete the protocol.
Provisions for posttrial care {30} Participants judged by the psychotherapist or the blinded assessor to be in need of further treatment after the end of the protocol will be referred to an appropriate facility within the Brazilian public health care system.
Outcomes {12} The primary outcome measure will be a change in the symptoms of anxiety and depression, as determined by the RCADS-25-P and RCADS-25-C [28, 29], between study entry (T0) and 1-3 days after the end of the

Casella et al. Trials (2022) 23:899

Page 6 of 15

intervention (T1, after five sessions of psychotherapy, five weeks of access to the psychoeducational videos, or both). The RCADS-25-P and RCADS-25-C will be completed by an independent clinician blinded to the allocation, on the basis of interviews (through videoconference or telephone call) with the guardians and the children/adolescents, respectively. The response variables will be the continuous T-scores for the three RCADS-25 domains (total, depression and anxiety).
Secondary outcomes will include the following: a change in the symptoms of anxiety and depression at follow-up; global functioning, assessed by the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale [41] and the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) [30, 42]; the impact of mental health symptomatology, as determined with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) impact supplement [43]; changes in irritability; emotional problems; environmental changes, as determined by passive smartphone data collection; the level of parental satisfaction with the telepsychotherapy sessions; and the potential harm (emergence of suicidal ideation and worsening of the quality of family relationships).
The blinded assessor will evaluate the difference between the anxiety and depressive symptomatology observed at T0 and that observed at follow-up (T2, 30 days after the last psychotherapy session, for the intervention group, or 30 days after the last video is made available, for the active control group) in an interview with the guardian and the child/adolescent, using the RCADS-25-P and RCADS-25-C.
The blinded assessor will evaluate the global functioning of the participants in interviews with the guardian and the child/adolescent (through videoconference or telephone call). The CGI-Severity (CGI-S) and CGAS scores obtained at T0 will be compared with those obtained at T1 and with those obtained at T2. Scores on the CGI-S range from 1 to 7, higher scores corresponding to greater symptom intensity. Scores on the CGAS range from 0 to 100, higher scores indicating better functionality. The CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) scores will be assessed at T1 and T2. Scores on the CGI-I range from 1 ("very much improved") to 7 ("very much worse").
The impact of the mental health symptomatology on the lives of the children/adolescents will be compared between T0 and T1, as well as between T0 and T2, by using the SDQ impact supplement [43], the score on which ranges from 0 to 10, higher scores indicating greater distress and impairment. The SDQ impact supplement will be completed by the blinded assessor in an interview with the guardian and the child/adolescent (through videoconference or telephone call).
Irritability is a quite common psychopathological trait in youth and is related to many disorders, including

depression and anxiety [44]. Therefore, we will evaluate the changes in child/adolescent irritability, as reported by the parents/guardians, between T0 and T1, as well as between T0 and T2. To that end, the blinded assessor will apply the parent-report Affective Reactivity Index (ARI), an index created to assess irritability [45], in an interview (by videoconference or telephone call).
Participants12 years of age with access to a smartphone will complete an ecological momentary assessment (EMA), which is a brief in-the-moment assessment of emotions, mood, stress and anxiety. Each of those participants will receive a notification on their smartphone to answer a series of questions intended to reflect their current state ("Right now, I feel..."), with a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 ("not at all") to 7 ("very much"). The EMA employs the experience sampling method (ESM) schedule [46], which consists of 17 questions and takes 3 min or less to complete. The ESM schedule will be delivered at four random times every day, within four 3-h blocks from 9:00 to 21:00, for six consecutive days in the week prior to the trial period and in the week after its end.
Participants12 years of age with access to a smartphone will be asked to install an application designed to passively collect data from the smartphone sensors-- the passive remote measurement technology (pRMT) application from the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR)-base platform [47]. The pRMT application will run in the background, requiring minimal input from participants, and will use the smartphone sensors to collect data on the following: ambient noise and light; relative GPS location (i.e. the distance travelled, rather than absolute coordinates or precise geographical location); the number of Bluetooth-enabled devices nearby; the duration of calls; the number of text messages and emails; the time spent using the smartphone; the time spent on social media; and battery life. Passive data collection will take place from T0 to T2. The aim of these measures is to determine whether parameters such as physical activity (estimated by the distance travelled) and proximity to other people (estimated by analysing Bluetooth connectivity with other smartphones) might be related to changes in anxiety and depressive symptomatology and whether those parameters show any improvement after the trial.
To assess the level of parental satisfaction with the telepsychotherapy sessions (intervention group only), parents will be asked to complete an adapted version of the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ) [48].
Potential harms were defined as the emergence of suicidal ideation and worsening of the quality of family relationships. As previously mentioned, we will use the parent-report four-item MFQ-SI to assess suicidal ideation in

Casella et al. Trials (2022) 23:899

Page 7 of 15

the last 2 weeks [31, 32], comparing T1 with T2. The MFQSI will be completed by the blinded assessor in an interview with the guardian (through videoconference or telephone call). To identify worsening of the quality of family relationships in the last 2 weeks, we will use the family relationship subscale of the family impact module of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) [49]. The PedsQL will be completed by the blinded assessor in interviews with the guardian at T0, T1 and T2. The family relationship subscale of the PedsQL comprises five items, covering topics such as "lack of communication between people in my family". For each item, there is a 5-point Likert scale (responses ranging from "never" to "almost always").
Participant timeline {13} All assessments (filling out electronic forms, videoconferencing and EMA) will be made via the internet or by telephone. Figure 1 shows the instruments and the time points at which they will be used.
Parents will complete an online form for eligibility screening and for the collection of sociodemographic data, as well as the 21-item parent-report psychopathology questionnaire Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) [50]. If their child/adolescent is considered eligible in this first assessment, a videoconference with a blinded outcome assessor will be scheduled. In this first videoconference, the eligibility criteria will be checked with the guardian and the child/adolescent. The baseline (T0) assessment will be made, confirming or correcting clinical data previously reported by the guardian at the eligibility screening. Two other videoconferences, in which similar clinical data will be collected by the blinded outcome assessor, will be scheduled for T1 and T2.
As previously mentioned, active smartphone data collection (the EMA) will be performed in the week prior to the intervention and in the week after its end, whereas passive smartphone data collection (through the pRMT application) will take place from T0 to T2. At T1, guardians in the intervention group will be asked to complete an online form comprising an adapted version of the TSQ [48].

to be evaluated in our study, we decided to be conservative and expect an effect size within the lower bound of that confidence interval, that is, 0.41. Therefore, the minimum sample size would be 190 participants, with an alpha of 0.05, power of 80% and 1:1 randomisation. Assuming an estimated attrition rate of 30%, we will need a total sample of 280 participants.
Recruitment {15} The study will be promoted via social media and email campaigns. People residing anywhere in Brazil will be able to participate. Parents interested in participating in the study will be referred to the study website, where they will be provided with further information regarding the study and the inclusion/exclusion criteria. They will then be asked to complete a basic online screening form and, if they meet the initial criteria, will be invited to a baseline assessment to be conducted through videoconference, in which the inclusion and exclusion criteria will also be confirmed.
Assignment of interventions: allocation
Sequence generation {16a} Randomisation will occur in real time, via a computer algorithm created to minimise differences between the two groups regarding sex and age, the latter being dichotomized as 8-11 years (children) or 12-17 years (adolescents). This algorithm uses the Aitchison distance to stratify the groups according to the chosen parameters [52], as has been done in previous studies [53-55].
Concealment mechanism {16b} Participants meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be listed sequentially by a research manager in a spreadsheet that will be used by another research manager for the randomisation. The latter research manager will have no direct contact with the patients.

Sample size {14} In a meta-analysis, Vigerland et al. [51] found the estimated size-effect for internet-delivered CBT in children and adolescents to be 0.62 (95% CI 0.41-0.84). Given that most of the studies assessed in that meta-analysis evaluated interventions involving a greater number of sessions than that

Implementation {16c} A research manager will randomise the patients using the computer algorithm described above. Another manager will then assign the participant to the respective intervention group, in accordance with the result of the randomisation.

Assignment of interventions: blinding
Who will be blinded {17a} The outcome assessor will be blinded to the group allocation. Families will be instructed not to provide the outcome assessor with any details regarding the treatment.
Procedure for unblinding if needed {17b} The design of the trial is single-blind. Because only the outcome assessors will be blinded, no unblinding will occur.
Data collection and management
Plans for assessment and collection of outcomes {18a} All assessors will be clinical psychologists with previous experience in child and adolescent mental health who have been trained in the study protocol by the study team coordinators. The instruments used in the assessments are described below.
- Sociodemographic questionnaire--the guardian will complete an online form designed to collect data on socioeconomic status, level of education, occupation and income, as well as data such as the age/sex of the child/adolescent, COVID-19 exposure history and routines (including study hours, sleep habits, sleep quality and screen time). Sleep quality will be assessed with an adapted version of the Single-item Sleep Quality Scale, which is comparable to other sleep scales such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [56]. Guardians will rate the sleep quality of their child/adolescent according to a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 ("terrible") to 4 ("excellent").
- DASS-21 [50]--The DASS-21 is a 21-item scale covering internalising symptoms in depression, anxiety and stress domains over the last 2 weeks. It consists of 21 statements (e.g. "I found it hard to wind down") that will be scored by the guardians using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 ("did not apply to me at all") to 3 ("applied to me very much or most of the time"). It has been shown to possess adequate validity and reliability in the Brazilian population (Cronbach's alpha: 0.92 for the depression subscale; 0.90 for the stress subscale; and 0.86 for the anxiety subscale) [57].
- RCADS-25--The RCADS-25 is a shortened version of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale. The original scale has 47 items and has been shown to be appropriate for use in various cultures, including that of Brazil [58]. The 25-item version is comparable to the original scale, and its use is preferred to reduce the burden of the respondent [30]. As previously mentioned, we will apply the RCADS-25-P

and RCADS-25-C [28, 29]. In a clinical sample, the alpha coefficients for the RCADS-25-C depression and anxiety scales were 0.80 and 0.91, respectively, whereas they were 0.79 and 0.76, respectively, in a community sample [29]. For the RCADS-25-P, the reported alpha coefficients were 0.83 for the depression scale, 0.85 for the anxiety scale and 0.85 for the total scale [28]. - MFQ-SI [31, 32]--The original MFQ is a 33-item questionnaire on mood symptomatology that has been adapted for use in Brazil [59]. Guardians will answer only the questions on the four-item composite version related to suicidal ideation (MFQ-SI), a topic that is not covered on the RCADS-25. - PedsQL--The PedsQL family impact module is a 36-item parent-report questionnaire that aims to assess the impact of chronic medical conditions on the quality of life of the family [49]. It has been adapted for use in Brazil [60]. We will use its fiveitem family relationships subscale to assess family dynamics. The subscale employs a 5-point Likert scale with responses ranging from "never" to "almost always" on topics such as "lack of communication between people in my family". - SDQ--The original SDQ is a 25-item questionnaire on child and adolescent psychopathology that has been adapted to many languages and used extensively in various countries, including Brazil [43], in its informant-report and self-report forms. There is an extended version of the SDQ [61] that includes a brief impact supplement (comprising five questions) designed to assess the potential burden related to the psychopathology of a child in areas such as home life and academic performance. For this study, we will use only the SDQ impact supplement, in order to assess the burden of the depressive and anxiety symptomatology. - ARI--The ARI is a seven-item irritability scale that includes six items related to symptoms related to irritability and one item related to the potential impact of irritability [62]. The ARI has been adapted for use in Brazil [45]. - TSQ [48]--Parental satisfaction with the telepsychotherapy sessions will be assessed (in the intervention group only) with an adapted version of the TSQ [48]. It is a 14-item questionnaire that assesses parameters such as difficulties in contacting the therapist and willingness to use telemedicine services again. - EMA of emotional problems--We will deliver an ESM protocol to assess mood, stress and emotion (Table 1). The protocol will be delivered using the COMVC application, which will send notifications for participants to rate affirmations about their cur-

rent state (e.g. "Right now, I feel happy") using an 8-point Likert scale with responses ranging from "not at all" to "very much". It represents a brief version of the ESM protocol used in the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse in Major Depressive Disorder study [47], a prospective multicenter study to determine the usability, acceptability and feasibility of remote collection of data regarding the symptoms of depression. - pRMT--The pRMT application, from the RADARbase platform [47], will be used in order to monitor the following smartphone features: the position sensor, which allows the relative location to be registered by using data on latitude and longitude; the movement sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer), which allow movement to be registered by measuring acceleration, rotation and the raw magnetic field, as well as by counting steps; environmental (light) sensors, which register the level ambient light; and activity logs, which include the time spent using the smartphone in general and on specific applications, as well as battery level and nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices.
Plans to promote participant retention and complete followup {18b} If a participant in the intervention group misses a session, the therapist will try to reschedule it, respecting

two conditions: there should be at least 48 h between sessions (so that participants can have enough time to do the "homework tasks"), and there should be no more than 4 weeks between the date of the first scheduled session and that of the last scheduled session. If the sessions cannot be rescheduled according to those conditions, the first four sessions will be prioritised, given that the fifth session is expected to be mostly a revision session. Participants will complete outcome assessments at T1 and T2, irrespective of the number of sessions completed or videos watched.
Data management {19} All data from the assessments and the sessions will be entered in the Research Electronic Data Capture [63], which is a secure database. The clinical data collected in the enrolment phase will be confirmed or corrected in the baseline assessment. All data, except the sociodemographic data, the TSQ score, the EMA results and the passive data, will be collected by a trained assessor.
The self-report data will be stored on the COMVC servers. The mobile smartphone sensor data will be stored on the RADAR-base platform. Both categories of data will also be backed up to Google Drive and Dropbox, and only the research team will have access to them.
Confidentiality {27} Information will be collected in a manner that protects the privacy of the participants. Sensitive information that

Casella et al. Trials (2022) 23:899

Page 11 of 15

might identify participants (name, hospital record number, telephone, physical address or electronic address) will not be included in the database. Each participant will be assigned an anonymous identifier. Passive data collection will also be conducted in a manner that protects sensitive data. The RADAR-base platform automatically converts information from position sensors (GPS data) into relative location using an unspecified point as a reference. Participant addresses or geographical (absolute) locations will not be registered. Likewise, we will not register the contents of emails and messages, nor the sites or content viewed on the web. Participants may choose not to participate in the EMA and the passive data collection, while still participating in the rest of the study.
Plans for collection, laboratory evaluation and storage of biological specimens for genetic or molecular analysis in this trial/future use {33} This trial will not involve the collection of biological specimens.
Statistical methods
Statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes {20a} We will use generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) to analyse the effects of the intervention. The primary outcome will be the change, from T0 to T1, in the total scores on the RCADS-25-P and RCADS-25-C. Fixed and random effects will be modelled with GLMMs. The fixed effects will be the randomisation status (intervention group vs. active comparator group) as an independent variable, along with the potential confounders (age, sex and other baseline characteristics). The random effect will be on the subject (first) level. Time will be inserted as a continuous independent variable. We will use the intention-to-treat approach--all randomised subjects will be included in the analysis, even if they drop out or switch arms. The marginal means of the models will be extracted by randomisation status and time, after which they will be plotted in a time series. In a second step, we will analyse the effects that the intervention has on the symptoms of depression and anxiety in the children and adolescents. For all models, we will present the beta coefficients with a confidence interval of 95%. For all statistical tests, the level of significance will be set at 5%. Analyses will be performed with the Stata software package, version 16.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA), and the programme R, version 4.0.1 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Interim analyses {21b} There will be no interim analyses.

Methods for additional analyses (e.g. subgroup analyses) {20b} Subgroup analyses will be conducted for children and for adolescents, as well as for the participants who were considered completers (i.e. attending three or more sessions) and did not start other mental health treatments (e.g. another psychotherapy intervention or psychotropic medication) during the intervention period.
Methods in analysis to handle protocol nonadherence and any statistical methods to handle missing data {20c} For the intention-to-treat analysis, we will use GLMMs. We will also perform secondary analyses excluding those not considered completers and those who started any other mental health treatment during the intervention period.
Plans to give access to the full protocol, participantlevel data and statistical code {31c} Any data required to support the protocol can be supplied on request. The datasets analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.
Oversight and monitoring
Composition of the coordinating centre and trial steering committee {5d} The trial coordinating centre comprises the principal investigator and trial managers. They will monitor the progress of the trial (including the recruitment of participants and attrition) and ensure adherence to its protocol. They will report any adverse events to the trial steering committee and research ethics committee.
The senior investigator of our group chairs the trial steering committee. He will therefore be responsible for decisions regarding the continuation, modification or termination of the study. Modifications will be implemented only after approval by the research ethics committee and adjustment of the clinical trial registry.
Composition of the data monitoring committee, its role and reporting structure {21a} This protocol has been approved by the local research ethics committee, which did not recommend the creation of a data monitoring committee.
Adverse event reporting and harms {22} The risk for participants is expected to be minimal, because the intervention is non-invasive. However, we will monitor participants to identify any potential side effects of the intervention, including increased symptomatology and emergence of suicidal ideation. In the

Casella et al. Trials (2022) 23:899

Page 12 of 15

clinical assessments (interviews with the guardians and the children/adolescents), the blinded assessor will collect data on symptomatology (through the use of the RCADS-25-P, ARI, SDQ impact supplement, CGI-S and CGI-I), emergence of suicidal ideation (through the use of the MFQ-SI) and disruption of family dynamics (through the use of the PedsQL family impact module). The blinded assessor will also collect data on any other form of mental health treatment that the family seeks between T0 and T2, including psychotherapy with other providers or psychopharmacological treatment.
If by the end of treatment the assessor identifies a significant level of symptomatology, the child/adolescent will be referred to continue the treatment within the Brazilian public health care system. One of the child psychiatrists on the team will evaluate the child/adolescent if necessary.
Frequency and plans for auditing trial conduct {23} The trial coordinating team will meet weekly to monitor the progress of the trial. The trial steering committee will oversee the trial on a monthly basis.
Plans for communicating important protocol amendments to relevant parties (e.g. trial participants, ethical committees) {25} Meetings of the research ethics committee meetings might be scheduled if any adverse event occurs, or in the event that the trial steering committee decides to make amendments to the trial protocol. Amendments to the protocol will be made only after approval by the research ethics committee. Should any amendment be made, the clinical trial registry (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT05139433) will be updated.

cognitive-behavioural techniques, some of which have previously been tested in crisis situations [65]. We have adapted some of those strategies to take advantage of new technologies, such as the delivery of psychoeducational videos via the internet.
One aspect of our study that is secondary but still of great relevance is the use of the smartphone as a tool to collect participant data, which is expected to increase ecological validity and reduce memory bias [66]. The use of passive data collection by the pRMT application might allow us to draw interesting correlations between mental health symptomatology and aspects such as screen time and physical activity.
Our protocol has some limitations. For instance, the active control group intervention is a self-guided psychoeducational activity, which could result in an overestimation of the intervention group results. We will not be comparing the intervention to a therapist-lead intervention to test the specific effects of the implementation procedure. The reportedly high (approximately 30%) dropout rates in trials of psychotherapy interventions [67-70] might be a challenge. The number of sessions (five) might also be insufficient for individuals who are more symptomatic. It is estimated that three quarters of the Brazilian population has internet access, although the level of connectivity is not homogeneous, with some areas lacking stable connections [71]. These factors could therefore limit the access to the intervention to part of the population. However, it is a robust intervention that could help increase the existing evidence in the area of telemedicine and in alternative ways of measuring data, such as via smartphone apps. It also foresees the alternative use of telephone for the intervention, in cases where poor internet connectivity continues to be an issue.

Dissemination plans {31a} At the end of the study, we intend to publish the data in a peer-reviewed journal and make the intervention manual and the psychoeducational videos public.
Discussion Videoconferencing in mental health was first employed approximately 70 years ago, in the 1950s [27], and its use increased considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic [64]. However, despite the growing body of literature on the topic, there is still a scarcity of scientifically validated protocols focusing on telepsychotherapy for children and adolescents [27]. If proven effective, the present protocol could not only help increase the evidence in this area but also represent a tool to improve access to mental health care even outside the context of the pandemic. The intervention is described in detail in the manual, which should facilitate its reproduction in other contexts. It is based on

Trial status Version 1.0 of the protocol was registered on November 17, 2021. Minor amendments (reducing the number of primary outcomes) were made and registered in July 2022. Recruitment began in October 2021 and is expected to end in January 2023.

Declarations
Ethics approval and consent to participate {24} This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of São Paulo School of Medicine Hospital das Clínicas (Reference no. 4,229,188). After this approval, we carried out a pilot trial. The result allowed us to identify the need for a few changes in the protocol. We increased the minimum age for participation (from 5 to 8 years), as the techniques proved to be less effective with younger children. In addition, we decided to include the EMA protocol. We submitted the changes to the Research Ethics Committee, which approved them (Reference no. 4,687,243). All participating children and adolescents will be required to provide informed assent and informed consent (from their guardians).

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been applied successfully in many real-life domains for solving complex problems. With the invention of Machine Learning (ML) paradigms, it becomes convenient for researchers to predict the outcome based on past data. Nowadays, ML is acting as the biggest weapon against the COVID-19 pandemic by detecting symptomatic cases at an early stage and warning people about its futuristic effects. It is observed that COVID-19 has blown out globally so much in a short period because of the shortage of testing facilities and delays in test reports. To address this challenge, AI can be effectively applied to produce fast as well as cost-effective solutions. Plenty of researchers come up with AI-based solutions for preliminary diagnosis using chest CT Images, respiratory sound analysis, voice analysis of symptomatic persons with asymptomatic ones, and so forth. Some AI-based applications claim good accuracy in predicting the chances of being COVID-19-positive. Within a short period, plenty of research work is published regarding the identification of COVID-19. is paper has carefully examined and presented a comprehensive survey of more than 110 papers that came from various reputed sources, that is, Springer, IEEE, Elsevier, MDPI, arXiv, and medRxiv. Most of the papers selected for this survey presented candid work to detect and classify COVID-19, using deep-learning-based models from chest X-Rays and CT scan images. We hope that this survey covers most of the work and provides insights to the research community in proposing efficient as well as accurate solutions for fighting the pandemic.

1. Introduction
World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 (COrona VIrus Disease-2019) on February 11, 2020, as the name of a new disease which is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Coronavirus is among the large family of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) that causes diseases from cold infections. It is one of the newest viruses that were not discovered previously in humans. Typical signs of infection include cough, sore throat, fever,

fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and breath shortness. COVID-19 pandemic is attributable to its property of respiratory transmission from one person to another, which causes the rapid spread of the disease. Wuhan in China reported the first case of COVID-19 in December 2019. WHO announced the coronavirus outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, because it has affected the whole globe physically, socially, economically, and in many other areas. Its impact forces most of the affected countries to announce and implement a complete lockdown in the country. Since the first case in

2

December 2019, the total number of infected people has reached more than 568 million as of Jul 20, 2022, including 6 million deaths. ere are two main reasons for these numbers, namely, fast-spreading nature of 2019-nCov and late arrival of symptoms after getting infected. People come to know after 10-14 days that they have been infected with this virus. As a result, during this period, thousands of people get infected from that affected person. e deficiency of facilities, namely, rapid identification of disease, laboratory facilities, isolation facilities, doctors, other staff, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits, and medicines, increases the risk of viral transmission. In general, we can say that the spreading rate of 2019nCov is exponential. Jiang et al. [1] have also modeled the shape of such epidemics to be exponential. e total infected cases of countries are getting double in just a few days because the characteristics of 2019-nCov are not fully recognized yet. It is hard to discover the positive cases at an early stage. at is why it is of utmost importance to detect COVID-19 at an early stage to prevent its spreading. Governments are continuously issuing precautionary guidelines to the citizens for seeking cooperation in this regard. ey used to advise citizens to follow social distancing and suspended industrial/school/office activities. It is the only way by which one can stay safer from getting infected. e situation of such a mysterious virus seems to be out of control as of now.
Many researchers are trying to devise mechanisms to investigate faster, reliable, and accurate detection of the disease. In general, we can classify all these techniques into two categories, namely, clinical examinations in the laboratory and other mechanisms (applying computational intelligence techniques, i.e., AI, ML, DL, and statistics). e goal of all these techniques has a single destiny, that is, to screen COVID-19 at an early stage. From the beginning, the validity of disease detection mainly depends on the earlier one, that is, clinical examinations. One of the famous techniques of this kind is Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). As compared to RT-PCR, computer-based detection can also help pathologists in a significant way because RT-PCR is a time-consuming investigation. It is sure that AI will not stop this pandemic but it can track and respond to the global emergency.
e performance of these techniques heavily depends on the availability of data. ey perform better when the size of data is relatively large. Here the authors have focused more on AI-enabled technologies for predicting or handling the disease outbreaks. Many researchers have claimed to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. However, the size of their datasets is not so large as it needs to be. erefore, this study aims to present a comprehensive survey of work done by several researchers in diagnosing COVID-19 from chest radiographic images, that is, CTsamples and X-ray images. e papers reviewed in this study are obtained from reputed sources, for example, ScienceDirect, Springer, MDPI, e Lancet, medRxiv, and arXiv preprints. Only specific studies related to deep learning models for early diagnosis of COVID-19 from radiographic images have been considered after applying several filters. e main contributions of this survey are highlighted as follows:

(1) Comprehensive discussion of some AI-based solutions (mobile Apps, CT software, knowledge-based systems, etc.) for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.
(2) In-depth review as well as the illustration of architectures of several deep-learning-based approaches (convolutional neural networks) for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest CT scans and X-ray images.
(3) Comparative study of classification accuracies of several deep learning models in classifying COVID19 from other types of pneumonia from CT scans and X-ray images.
(4) Brief discussion of several computational approaches for analyzing and predicting the COVID-19 pandemic trends.
(5) Presenting several imaging datasets for encouraging COVID-19 research.
(6) Highlighting the pros and cons of deep-learningbased approaches for COVID-19 along with pointing out several open research issues.
e rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the importance of Artificial Intelligence in COVID-19 by presenting a few AI-based solutions that can play a vital role in coping with the COVID-19 outbreak. Deep-learning-based approaches for the identification of COVID-19 from the chest CT scan and X-ray images are briefed in Section 3 and Section 4, respectively. Section 5 highlights some contributions of computational approaches other than deep learning for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. Some COVID-19 public imaging datasets for performing the deep-learning-based research are presented in Section 6. A brief discussion of the pros and cons of using deep learning in solving real-life problems is presented in Section 7. Finally, Section 8 concludes the study with future directions.
2. AI-Enabled Solutions for COVID-19
AI-based automated disease detections are becoming more popular nowadays. ere are several advantages of detecting COVID-19 using AI-based techniques, namely, faster detection, fewer chances of being affected while collecting and testing samples, cost-effectiveness, portability, and no worries about the availability of testing kits. During the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, only a few repositories with limited COVID-19 patients' images were available. However, nowadays, there are many accessible progressive repositories to help the research community deploy and test their deep-learning-based models. Some sample X-ray and CT scan images of COVID-19-affected lungs are shown in Figures 1(a) and 1(b), respectively.
However, it is challenging to detect novel Coronavirus (nCov) infections at an early stage with the help of X-ray and CT scan images using deep learning. However, at a later stage, the task of radiologists in screening COVID-19 patients can be eased. Deep learning as an emerging concept is gaining popularity in the field of medical imaging. Before

discussing more details about the deep learning paradigm, let us find out the relationship between neural network (NN), deep learning (DL), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) as shown in Figure 2.
Mei et al. [4] presented an AI-based solution for minimizing the RT-PCR method's time. ey have integrated chest CT finding with several other factors, namely, symptoms and laboratory testing for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19. e system was claimed to be a more powerful tool for radiologists if CT images and clinical history were available. e reason behind the integration of other parameters with CT findings is to provide higher accuracy because CT findings alone are not enough to predict the infection. In some cases, early CT findings can be standard for an infected person, so, to minimize the risk of spreading the disease, it is foremost required to integrate some other parameters to have a clear idea.
e authors first developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to learn the characteristics of CT images. e process is put into action by the classification of COVID-19 patients using three different classification techniques, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Random Forest. e performance of MLP was better than those of the other techniques under consideration.

Fong et al. [5] developed a model using Composite Monte Carlo (CMC) for making decisions under the high uncertainty of 2019-nCov. We know that, in the pandemic of COVID-19, every Government is supposed to make crucial decisions to save its citizens' essential lives, but, due to the uncertain behavior of 2019-nCov, it seems a challenging task. CMC can forecast by combining data from small data sources, followed by drawing probability distributions. e authors have significantly used this property of CMC, followed by enhancements using DL and fuzzy rule induction. MC is suitable to model epidemics such as COVID-19 because their data are generally changing over time. MC provides output in terms of probability distributions of expected outcomes. e work of Fong et al. [5] is based on the Group of Optimized and Multisource Selection (GROOMS), which is applied to select a Machine Learning model based on accuracy. ey have analyzed the data collected from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention1(CCDC). eir parameters of interest were only a few, namely, the number of people affected by and cured of COVID-19. However, these parameters' values depend on various other parameters, namely, social factors and psychological factors. e method was followed by fuzzy rule induction (FRI), which further investigates the logic behind the epidemic. eir goal was to estimate the cost needed for

employed to train their powerful system for sending noti-

technologies like AI, NLP, and Big Data to make predictions

several sources, analyzing them using advanced analytical

tools, and making predictions about outbreaks. It also

controlling and planning during these epidemics. Experimental results have shown that the novel methodology can forecast the direct cost requirements for dealing with COVID-19 epidemics. On the other hand, Peng and Nagata [6] analyzed the trend of COVID-19 pandemic data of the twelve most affected countries for predicting the number of COVID-19 cases using Machine-Learning-based approaches. ey have emphasized the need for utmost caution while applying Machine Learning models in decision making, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, Mehta and Shukla [7] presented a pandemic analysis using AI and big data analytics.
2.1. Some AI-Enabled Tools for Coping with a COVID-19 Outbreak. AI-enabled tools are getting popular in the healthcare domain due to their tremendous applications. Many companies are running their businesses in the healthcare sector by providing solutions to common problems using AI. Current applications of AI, namely, radiology and diagnosis, are so specific that they may not be suitable to predict a global pandemic like COVID-19. However, few companies like BlueDot [8] and Metabiota [9] claimed that their AI-enabled solutions can identify, quantify, and mitigate the risks due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

2.1.3. Chatbots. Chatbots can also play a critical role in screening patients before sample collection. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, pathological laboratories (identified as COVID-19 test/sample collection center) face a huge crowd. To minimize this crowd, these labs are filtering patients by first putting them under NLP-enabled chatbot to answer a few essential queries; and one can decide the severity or urgency of being tested. eir chatbots are so powerful in analyzing the responses of patients in real time and suggesting the preliminary diagnosis. Patients on their own can take advantage of these chatbots at their home before proceeding to hospitals/laboratories.
2.1.4. Qure.ai. Qure.ai [11], a US-based company, is offering several solutions in the field of healthcare. To cope with the pandemic of COVID-19 using AI, they have devised two special tools, namely, "qXR" and "qScout-EMR." "qXR" tool is meant for COVID-19 progression monitoring. is automated tool monitors the progression of infected patients daily. It automatically estimates the affected lung area and tracks changes. "qScout-EMR," on the other hand, is providing a pandemic response care platform. All registrations of infected persons are done using this tool and are accessible via any mobile or laptop. e registration step adds all linked contacts that can be at risk. It monitors their health by daily symptom checking and sending intimations to all concerned automatically.

2.1.1. BlueDot. e AI-enabled tool of BlueDot [8] can perform predictions on outbreaks of infectious diseases. It collects data from numerous sources using AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities. As per its website, BlueDot was the first to intimate its client about COVID-19 risk via their "insights" platform. Its Big Data processing capabilities collect data from more than 10,000 sources over 60 languages every day [10]. Primary sources include air travel data, population density, national statistics reports, World Factbook, global infectious disease alert, climate data, and animals' disease reservoirs. After collecting data from

2.1.5. AlphaFold. DeepMind [12], founded in 2010 and further acquired by Google in 2014, is a famous AI-enabled company working for advancing the state of the art. DeepMind's "AlphaFold" is an AI-enabled protein structure prediction system, shown in Figure 3. e core of AlphaFold is its CNN model trained with genomic data extracted from Protein Data Bank (PDB). It works by finding out the distributions among several pairs of residues in a protein because disease predictions rely heavily on protein structure.
e distribution calculation is antecedent to the estimation of the proposed structure.

2.1.6. RADLogics. RADLogics [13] has presented its AIbased CT image analysis tools for accurate and automatic identification of COVID-19. eir AI-based analysis also suggests a corona score for measuring a patient's progression and recovery time. Another AI-based solution called "Virtual Resident" can analyze X-ray, CT scan, MRI, and ultrasound scans. Some researchers [13] also deployed a deep-learning-based model for COVID-19 classification from CT scan images using pretrained AI systems of RADLogics as their subsystem.
2.1.7. Aarogya Setu. To help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in India, the Government of India (GOI) launched the Aarogya Setu mobile app [14] on April 02, 2020. Aarogya Setu app provides many facilities based on Bluetooth and GPS, such as contact tracing of COVID-19 patients, hotspot mapping, and providing other important information relevant to COVID-19. Over 215 million users were taking benefits from this app as of April 05, 2022. After installation, the user must complete a self-assessment test by answering some simple questions on symptoms of cough, fever, difficulty in breathing, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, travel history, interaction with any COVID-19 patient, and so forth. Based on users' answers, this app collects location-related data via Bluetooth and GPS so that the Government can track the patient and notify other users within that region. Along with COVID-19 tracking, the app provides several other facilities to the citizens, that is, e-pass (permission for traveling to other states and districts during lockdown period) generation, COVID-19 updates, COVID19 helpline, useful resources, list of laboratories approved by GOI for COVID-19 testing, essential links for donations to PM care fund, and notifications related to COVID-19 patients within the radius of 500 m to 10 km. e app is available to be used in twelve languages of India, and its code was also released to be open source by GOI on May 26, 2020.
2.1.8. AI4COVID-19. Imran et al. [15] developed an AIengine-based app to distinguish between a regular cough and a COVID-19 cough by analyzing cough samples. Cough is a common symptom of suffering from cold, and that is why cough alone cannot be the key-decisive parameter to

identify that a person is suffering from COVID, but it can help patients perform initial screening on their own in just a few moments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, such apps present themselves as the best usage of technologies.
As per the availability of progressive cough data, the accuracy of this app may improve. e app is also not clinically approved but is based on features of distinct respiratory syndromes of cough. e app works by collecting cough samples that are input for the pretrained AI engine to recognize the type of cough based on features. e overall architecture of AI4COVID-19 is depicted in Figure 4. Initially recorded cough samples are converted to Mel-spectrogram using Cepstral analysis. e result of this phase is the input images for the CNN model for cough detection. Experimental detail shows 90% accuracy of the AI4COVID19 app for the identification of COVID and non-COVID cough. Several other applications which are applied by many countries for tracing COVID-19 are summarized by Lalmuanawma et al. [16].
3. Deep-Learning-Based Identification of COVID-19 and Pneumonia from CT Scan Images
Detecting COVID-19 from images alone is a challenging task. Due to the sudden outbreak of COVID-19, radiologists and hospitals are feeling overburdened. is type of burden on the healthcare sector is correlated directly with COVID19 mortalities [17]. On the other hand, deep learning methodologies are trying to reduce this burden by screening COVID-19 patients at an early stage. In a short period, plenty of researchers have developed CNN models for faster and reliable patients' screening to minimize the time required for disease identification. CT scan analysis is one of the predominant investigations for the screening of COVID19 patients. e importance of CT scan images is observed easily from several clinical case study reports. Lin et al. [18] discussed the importance of CT scan images in identifying asymptomatic patients of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP). e reported patients were asymptomatic with no preexisting diseases. However, multiple ground-glass opacities (GGO) were located with the help of High-Resolution CT (HRCT). One of the patients was 61 years old, and that patient remained without any complications and had no symptoms, namely, fever, fatigue, cough, myalgias, headache, tiredness, sputum production, hemoptysis, or diarrhea. e patient also had no history of smoking and no history of other diseases, namely, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. e patient was treated with oral antiviral drugs only. Fortunately, after the 23rd day of admission, the patient's bilateral pulmonary lesions and pleural effusions got resolved.
DL-based implementation is used for preparing detailed clinical reports of patients as well. In this regard, Cao et al. [19] presented detailed illustrations of two COVID-19 positive patients using voxel-level DL-based segmentation of CT scan images based on U-Net [20]. Keeping in mind the importance of CT scan images, this section highlights some

of the works that focused on identifying COVID-19 and pneumonia from chest CT scan images using deep-learningbased paradigms. Although CNNs provide several metrics by which one can analyze their performances, the work discussed in this paper is mainly focused on analyzing classification metrics. One of the prime metrics to measure the classification performance is the confusion matrix, shown in Figure 5.
e confusion matrix summarizes correct versus incorrect predictions of a classification model, where predicted observations are matched with the actual ones. TP, FP, FN, and TN are explained as follows:
(i) True Positive (TP): positive prediction of positive observation.
(ii) False Positive (FP): positive prediction of negative observation.
(iii) False Negative (FN): negative prediction of positive observation.
(iv) True Negative (TN): negative prediction of negative observation.
ese metrics are further utilized to provide the classification performance in terms of precision, specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and so forth described as given in the five following equations:
precision  TP , (1) (TP + FP)
Sensitivity  TN , (2) (TN + FP)
Specificity or Recall  TP , (3) (TP + FN)
Accuracy  (TP + TN) , (4) (TP + TN + FP + FN)

In this paper, the authors presented a comparison based on classification accuracy of several deep learning models for classifying CTscan as well as X-ray images to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 images.
Wang et al. [21] deployed an AI-based system that is capable of automatically detecting COVID-19 from CT scan images. eir system has achieved a sensitivity of 0.98 and is installed in 16 hospitals, screening 1300 cases per day. e system is doing two main intended tasks, namely, reducing healthcare burden during screening and fulfilling the lack of experienced radiologists. Based on their earlier developed deep learning models, they have selected the best model for this task. e data of COVID-19 patients were taken from 5 hospitals in Wuhan and Beijing. After collecting relevant data, annotations for lesions (if any) were processed, followed by several preprocessing techniques (normalization, window width, window width adjustments, lung segmentation, etc.).
e deep learning architecture of their system is mainly divided into two models, namely, segmentation and classification. e segmentation model is used for obtaining lung regions, and the classification model determines COVID-19 positivity in these regions. For both segmentation and classification models, they have selected the best models out of their previously developed models. e combined 3D U-Net++ [22] (segmentation model) and ResNet50 [23] (classification model) achieved best area under the curve (AUC) of 0.991.
Zheng et al. [24] developed a novel CNN model called DeCoVNet for detecting COVID-19 from chest CT images.
e model first segments the CT images using a pretrained U-Net [20], and then these segmented images are fed into the DL model for COVID-19 prediction. Along with segmented images, they have considered several other factors, namely, clinical signs, travel and disease history, and laboratory examinations. e ground truth label was applied as per the decision made by expert radiologists. e input to DeCoVNet is CT volume and its corresponding lung mask (generated by U-Net [20]). 3D lung mask contributes toward reducing background information to achieve higher accuracy. Original CT volume is combined with the 3D lung mass volume to make a final volume followed by resampling into a 224 × 336 resolution. Due to limited data availability, data augmentation has been applied. ese resampled images serve as input for training the network. DeCoVNet consists of three main parts, namely, network stem, 3D residual blocks (ResBlocks), and a progressive classifier (ProClf ). e network stem consists of 3D convolution using a kernel of a 5 × 7 × 7 size and batch norm and pooling layers. Meanwhile, in the second step, from each ResBlock, a 3D feature map is being passed into 3D convolution. Finally, ProClf performs

the classification of images using three 3D convolution layers and a fully connected layer with a softmax activation function. e overall pipeline of DeCoVNet is shown in Figure 6. For validating the experimental study, images of 630 CTscans were considered. Out of 630 CTscans, 499 were used for training and the rest for testing. e results of the experimental study are promising, which in turn may contribute to the healthcare sector.
Song et al. [25] proposed a deep learning model for the identification of COVID-19 from chest CT scan images.
ey first collected CT scan images of 88 COVID-19 patients, followed by preprocessing filling blank regions in the lung images. Top-k detail from CT scan images was extracted using Details Relation Extraction Neural Network (DRENet) and then final prediction was performed using aggregation. However, the model was able to achieve the classification accuracy of only 86%.
Zhang et al. [26] constructed a novel deep-learningbased model for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 from an extensive CT image database of 3,777 patients. e overall work is comprised of two main models, namely, lung segmentation and analysis. In lung-lesion segmentation, the lung lesions are segmented from the background using DeepLabv3 to create a lung-lesion map. e lung-lesion map is further utilized for the classification of CT segments and achieved an overall classification accuracy of 92.49%.
Pretrained models are playing a pivotal role in deploying models for COVID-19 identification. Kini et al. [27] employed the concept of transfer learning by proposing an ensemble deep learning model and achieved an overall accuracy of 98.98%. Li et al. [28] developed a deep learning model called COVNet (based on ResNet50 [23]) for detecting COVID-19 by extracting features from 4356 3D chest CT examinations (collected from 6 hospitals). Out of these images, 30% were of COVID-19-positive patients (confirmation by RT-PCR), 40% of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and the rest 30% of nonpneumonia. ey have used the 3D CT scan slices as input for training the model and developed a feature map from features extracted from these slices. e feature extraction phase is then followed by a maxpooling operation for combining features of these slices. Finally, a fully connected layer generates a feature map followed by the generation of probability score by a softmax activation function. eir model was able to present the specificity of 96% and AUC of 0.96 for COVID-19 identification.
Ardakani et al. [29] presented a study of ten CNN models for classification of COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia from CT scan images. Out of ten well-known CNN models, the performances of ResNet-101 [23] and Xception [30] were found to be better compared to the others. ResNet101 achieved 99.51% accuracy, whereas Xception achieved 99.02% in classifying COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases. ey have also analyzed radiologists' performance for the same purpose and reported moderate performance with a classification accuracy of 83.33%. It is evident that not only are computational models, especially deep learning models, able to save a significant amount of time in reading the radiographical images but also they provide accurate results.

Xu et al. [31] presented an automated deep learning model (based on ResNet18) for COVID-19 classification from 3D CT scan images. e experimental evaluation was done on 618 CT samples, out of which 219 images were of 110 COVID-19 patients, 224 of influenza patients, and 175 of healthy personnel. ese 3D CT images were then segmented for identification of required region of interest. Feature extraction was done from segmented images using ResNet18, followed by pooling operation for dimension reduction and to prevent overfitting. e output is then converted to a feature vector followed by a fully connected layer that provides the final classification of images into three classes: COVID-19, influenza, and healthy. e model was able to achieve an overall classification accuracy of 86.7% only.
Chen et al. [32] presented a deep learning model (based on U-Net++ [22]) for COVID-19 classification from HighResolution CT (HRCT) scan images. A dataset of 46096 CT images of 106 patients was used for evaluating the performance of the model. ree experienced radiologists did the labeling on infected regions. e model has achieved the perpatient classification accuracy of 95.24% and per-image classification accuracy of 98.85%. However, some inconsistencies were observed between the evaluations performed by a radiologist and their model.
Shan et al. [33] developed a 3D convolutional neural network called VB-Net (based on V-Net [34]) for COVID19 classification from CT scan images. As compared to V-Net, VB-Net has shown more efficiency. VB-Net consists of two phases, namely, downsampling and feature extraction and upsampling and feature integration. A total of 549 CT images were considered for the study, out of which 300 were used for testing and 259 for training. Testing and training contained a significant number of lung infections and they were collected from different CT scan centers. Based on segmentation results by VB-Net, the study follows a statistical analysis of the percentage of infection (POI) in lung and bronchopulmonary segments. Comparative analysis between automatic segmentation and manual segmentation yields a mean POI estimation error of 0.3%.
Huang et al. [35] presented a deep learning model (based on U-Net [20]) for the classification of chest CT scan images. Generally, deep learning models only prove the necessary information about whether a patient is affected by a disease. However, their model classified CT images into four categories (i.e., mild, moderate, severe, and critical) with the help of evaluation performed by both automatic segmentation and radiologists. A chest CT scan of 842 COVID-19 confirmed patients was considered in the experimental

8

evaluation. For feature extraction, U-Net [20] uses downsampling for reducing the 512 × 512 image to a 16 × 16 × 256 feature map and upsampling to 512 × 512 × 2 for lesion localization.
Wang et al. [36] presented a deep learning algorithm by fine-tuning the pretrained Inception model to classify chest CT images. ey have used 1,065 images for the experimental study, out of which 325 images were of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 patients. eir algorithm consists of three main components, namely, image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Overall, network architecture can be viewed as a two-phase network model, where the first phase is responsible for generating a one-dimensional feature vector, and later a fully connected network performs the final classification. e overall classification accuracy (89.5%) of their model is further compared with the predictions made by two skilled radiologists. e performance of thier model was found to be better than the performance of radiologists. Pan and Guan [38] also summarized some expected changes in the patients using CT scan images. CT manifestations can represent several features (lung GGOs, pulmonary consolidation, nodules, etc.) that can help detect 2019-nCov. Pathak et al. [37] presented a deep-transfer-learning-based model using ResNet50 [23] for detecting COVID-19 cased from CT images. eir model was able to achieve a test accuracy of 93% only. Meanwhile Wu et al. [39] presented a deeplearning-based multiview fusion model capable of analyzing age-based subgroups of COVID-19 cases from CT images.
e summary of several deep-learning-based models used for diagnosis of COVID-19 from CT scan images is presented in Table 1 along with their classification accuracies. However, the datasets used in these works may not be the same.
4. Deep-Learning-Based Identification of COVID-19 and Pneumonia from X-Ray Images
Chest X-ray images also have the capabilities to show the symptoms of lung infections. However, as compared to CT images, X-ray images are less sensitive [40]. In most cases, the chest X-rays are reported to be normal during the disease's initial stages [41]. At later stages, some abnormalities in terms of diffuse and peripheral lung involvements have been observed. Nowadays, plenty of research is considering X-ray images to determine whether a person is suffering from COVID-19 or not. In this section, the authors tried to cover some of the works related to COVID-19 and pneumonia identification from chest X-ray images using deep-learning-based paradigms.
Aftab et al. [42] proposed an LSTM-based model to classify chest X-ray images into three classes, namely, normal, influenza, and COVID-19. With the incorporation of LSTM, their model was able to achieve 98% accuracy. Another LSTM-based model to detect COVID-19 from hybrid images was proposed by Irfan et al. [43]. eir hybrid deep neural network (HDNN) was equipped with a CNN for automated feature extraction and an LSTM for dealing with

vanishing gradients. e HDNN was able to provide 99% classification accuracy on hybrid images. Almalki et al. [44] presented a novel deep-learning-based method called CoVIRNet (COVID Inception-ResNet model) for COVID19 identification from X-ray images. e proposed model was able to achieve a classification accuracy of 97.29% using the Random Forest classifier. Zhang et al. [45] developed a new reliable deep learning model for fast screening of COVID-19 patients. e model works by detecting anomalies from chest X-ray images with 96% accuracy for symptomatic patients and 70.65% for asymptomatic persons. eir model consists of three main phases, namely, backbone network, classification, and anomaly detection.
e purpose of the backbone network is to extract useful features from X-ray images. ese features act as inputs for classification and anomaly detection. e results presented by them are promising, with a limitation of a 30% false positive rate. Deep learning has many applications in the healthcare sector. Panwar et al. [46] also presented a deeplearning-based model called nCOVnet for detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images. eir model is based on the concept of transfer learning where they have used top layers of VGG16 [47] and later customized with other layers. Experimental analysis on 337 X-ray images (192 COVID-19positive images) presented a classification accuracy of 97.62%.
Stephen et al. [48] have also presented an efficient approach for pneumonia classification using deep learning. eir dataset contains 5,856 anterior-posterior chest X-ray images of pneumonia patients aged 1 to 5 years. To make the dataset adequate and reduce the chances of overfitting, several augmentation techniques were employed. eir model contains two main parts, namely, feature extractor and classifier. Feature extractor contains four convolution layers (conv3 × 3, 32; conv3 × 3, 64; conv3 × 3, 128; and conv3 × 3, 128), max-pooling layer of a 2 × 2 size, and ReLU activation function. For classification, the dense layer uses the 1D feature vector as provided by the flattening process. Experimental results showed that their model could classify pneumonia and nonpneumonia images with a training accuracy of 0.95 and validation accuracy of 0.93. Wang and Wong [49] developed a novel deep learning model called COVID-Net for the detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. ey have classified chest X-ray images into four classes, namely, normal, bacterial infection, non-COVID viral infection, and COVID infection. e architecture design is mainly based on the projection-expansion-projection pattern. Despite adequate dataset consisting of 5941 chest images of 2839 patients collected from two growing public datasets, they achieved only 83.5% test accuracy.
DeTraC, a new method for detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images, has been presented by Abbas et al. [50]. DeTraC uses a threefold approach consisting of pretrained CNN models for feature extraction followed by class decomposition, training using gradient descent optimization, and classification. Experimental results on X-ray images showed a classification accuracy of 93.1% using VGG19 [47].

Zebin and Rezvy [51] used several pretrained CNNs for extracting features from chest X-ray (CXR) images and achieved 96.8% accuracy using EfficientNetB0 for COVID19 classification. Apostolopoulos et al. [52] also presented the classification of COVID-19 disease using state-of-the-art MobileNetV2 [53] on 3905 CXR images. Training the CNN from scratch can also lead to higher accuracy as depicted in their experimental results for classification of COVID and non-COVID cases. Along with COVID, their dataset consists of images of five other diseases and normal CXR images. Concerning the 2-class classification problem, their model gained an overall accuracy of 99.18% compared to 7-class accuracy of 87.66%.
Instead of developing deep learning models from scratch, pretrained models are also gaining popularity. In this regard, Togaçar et al. [54] presented a model based on MobileNetV2 [53] and SqueezeNet [55] followed by SVMbased classification for classifying COVID-19-affected chest X-ray images from normal and pneumonia images.
e deep learning model MobileNet is designed to perform object detection and classification for low hardware devices. MobileNet uses the ReLU activation function for providing nonlinear outputs. SqueezeNet [55], on the other hand, provides faster results by reducing the number of parameters, which leads to a reduction in overall model size. It contains a cascade of convolution, pooling, and fire layers.
ey have applied the concept of image reconstruction using the fuzzy color technique to remove noise. e images produced by the fuzzy color technique are further mixed with original images for the creation of a new dataset. 1000 features were generated with both MobileNet and SqueezeNet on the new dataset, followed by efficient features using Social Mimic Optimization (SMO). e overall pipeline of their work is depicted in Figure 7.
Experimental analysis on the 70 : 30 ratio of training and testing dataset claimed 99.27% accuracy using both models. Ozturk et al. [56] proposed a deep learning model based on the YOLO pretrained model called DarkCovidNet to automatically identify COVID-19 cases from X-ray images with an accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes (COVID and non-COVID). However, one of the essential requirements for a deep learning model (large dataset) is still missing. ey

have used a database consisting of 127 X-ray images of COVID-19-positive patients . Also, most of the patients' age information is unknown, and the age was approximated to be 55 in their experimental evaluation. However, 1000 images from another dataset named ChestX-ray8 are also considered in the study, but they all do not belong to COVID-19 patients. eir model contains 17 convolutional layers, followed by BatchNorm and LeakyReLU operations. For updating weights, the Adam optimizer is being used along with the cross-entropy loss function. eir experimental results are based on an 80 : 20 ratio of training versus testing data using 5-fold cross-validation and 100 epochs. After classifying images into COVID-19 and no findings, they have used HeatMap to identify the lesions, and the same was presented before expert radiologists for final verification, as shown in Figure 8. is final step provides strength to validate the proposed model.
Ghosal and Tucker [57] presented a Bayesian deep learning classifier that uses pretrained ResNet50V2 to classify COVID-19 images from 5941 chest X-ray images.
eir objective was to help radiologists estimate the uncertainty of deep learning models for reliable prediction of diseases. Especially for a beginner radiologist, deep learning models can contribute to increasing overall prediction accuracy.
On the other hand, Narin et al. [58] presented a deep learning model for the identification of COVID-19 using three existing deep learning models, namely, ResNet50 [23], InceptionV3 [59], and InceptionResNetV2 [60], from X-ray images as shown in Figure 9.
eir models need no separate feature extraction; instead, they use the transfer learning capabilities that provide adequate accuracy even in fewer data. eir experimental analysis depicted higher classification accuracy of 98% using ResNet50 [23] compared to 97% and 87% accuracy using InceptionV3 and InceptionResNetV2, respectively.
Sethy et al. [61] also presented a framework for the identification of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. eir model extracted features from thirteen existing CNN models followed by SVM classification. e classification problem presented here is a three-class problem intended to classify chest X-ray images into three classes, namely, healthy,

pneumonia, and COVID. A total of 381 X-ray images (127 of each category) have been considered in the experimental study. RestNet50 [23] model was able to present maximum classification accuracy as compared to other models under consideration.
Hemdan et al. [62] presented a framework that takes advantage of the existing seven deep learning models, namely, VGG19, DenseNet201 [63], MobileNetV2, Xception, ResNetV2, InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3. ey have considered chest X-ray images of 50 patients only, out of which 25 patients were COVID-19-positive. Experimental results show higher accuracy of 90% in the cases of VGG19 and DenseNet201.
Khan et al. [64] also presented a deep learning model called CoroNet based on a pretrained Xception model for the classification of chest X-ray images. Xception is pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and consists of 71 deep layers connected in a residual manner, which avoids vanishing

gradients. eir work is classified into three main scenarios, namely, four-class, three-class, and two-class classification.
eir experimental analysis on public datasets [2] revealed an overall classification accuracy of 89.6%.
Rahimzadeh and Attar [65] trained various CNN models and presented a concatenated network using Xception and ResNet50V2 for classifying X-ray images into three classes, namely, COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal. Xception contains several inception layers which are formed from depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution operation. ResNet50V2, on the other hand, is a modified version of ResNet50 [23], whose performance is better than that of ResNet50. eir input dataset consists of 180 images (300 × 300 pixels) of COVID-19-positive patients. Both Xception and ResNet50V2 produced an equal-sized 10 × 10 × 2048 feature map from their feature extractors.
ese feature maps are then concatenated, followed by a convolution layer. Confusion matrices showed that the concatenated network achieved 99.50% accuracy in classifying COVID-19 images with an overall accuracy of 91.4%.
Chowdhury et al. [66] presented a comparative study of various deep learning models, namely, DenseNet201, ResNet18, SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, ResNet101, CheXNet [67], and VGG19, for classifying chest X-ray images into three different classes, that is, normal, COVID-19, and viral pneumonia. ey have created a COVID-19 dataset of chest X-ray images. For doing this, they have received "Winner of COVID-19 Dataset Award" by Kaggle. Testing and training accuracies of four different CNN models have been presented. SqueezeNet achieved higher testing accuracy of 98.3%, whereas ResNet18 achieved higher training accuracy of 99.5%. Apostolopoulos et al. [68] incorporated the concept of transfer learning and

evaluated five well-known CNN models (VGG19, MobileNetV2, InceptionResNetV2, Inception, and Xception) on two chest X-ray databases for classification of COVID-19. VGG19 and MobileNetV2 were able to achieve higher accuracy of 98.75% and 97.40%, respectively, compared to other models in the case of two-class classification. For the three-class classification task, VGG19 achieved the highest accuracy of 93.48% among all other models under study.
Altan and Karasu [69] developed a hybrid model called EfficientNetB0 using deep learning, 2D curvelet transformation, and Chaotic Salp Swarm Algorithm (CSSA) for screening COVID-19 cases from X-ray images. Experimental results on X-ray images of 219 COVID-19 patients showed that the hybrid model has achieved the classification accuracy of 99.69%. At the same time, Brunese et al. [70] presented a transfer-learning-based model for classifying COVID-19 images from X-ray images with an accuracy of 97%. Ucar and Korkmaz [71] also presented a deep learning model based on light pretrained SqueezeNet for classifying COVID-19 from X-ray images. eir system firstly augments the raw dataset in an offline manner, followed by training of deep-SqueezeNet that takes advantage of Bayesian optimization and then tests the network for final

decision making. e main reason behind using Bayesian optimization is to optimize hyperparameters automatically.
e Bayesian optimization task calculates the posterior probability P(D|L) of a deep learning model using learned data. Experimental results on the COVIDx public dataset showed 100% classification accuracy in COVID X-ray images with an overall classification accuracy of 98.26%. Mahmud et al. [72] proposed a deep-learning-based model called CovXNet to extract various features from chest X-ray images. ey first trained their model with chest X-ray images of traditional pneumonia followed by COVID-19caused pneumonia because they possess almost the same kind of imaging features. Experimental results have shown that their system can provide multidilation classification with an accuracy of 97.4%.
On the other hand, Pereira et al. [73] also presented a deep learning model based on InceptionV3 for the identification of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. ey have performed multiclass classification using five famous classifiers and achieved an F1-score of 0.89 in classifying COVID-19 from another type of pneumonia. Performance analysis of several deep learning models for classification of COVID-19 from X-ray images is presented in Table 2. However, the datasets used in these works may not be the same. During this pandemic, plenty of researchers came with several pretrained and transfer-learning-based approaches for the classification of COVID-19 from chest X-ray and CT samples [74-78].
Along with CT and X-ray-based examinations, some clinical observations also play an essential role in detecting diseases. In this regard, Hosseiny et al. [67] presented a comparative study of clinical and radiological features of COVID-19 with existing SARS and MERS diseases. ey highlighted the importance of early CT findings for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Li et al. [79] presented an analysis of both clinical manifestations and COVID-19 imaging. On the other hand, Shah et al. [80] presented a comprehensive survey of several computational approaches for detection of COVID-19 from medical images.
5. Other Computational Approaches for COVID-19
Plenty of AI-based, statistical, and technological solutions are also provided by researchers in the area of COVID-19 research. Digital technology has several applications that can help plan and respond to COVID-19 pandemic [68]. is section highlights some of the works related to computational models for diagnosing and predicting COVID-19.
5.1. Machine-Learning-Based Approaches. Machine Learning approaches learn by extracting useful features from the data and can predict the futuristic trends/patterns using that learning. ese approaches proved themselves in providing support to the clinical diagnosis.
To assist the quick diagnosis of COVID-19 and analyze the epidemic trends, several Machine-Learning-based solutions have been presented by researchers. For a quick and

accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, a Random Forest (RF) based tool has been developed by Wu et al. [81]. e tool has extracted 11 blood indices from clinical blood test data and proved its validity by achieving 96% accuracy. Shi et al. [82] also developed a Random Forest based approach for automatic classification of CT samples based on infected lesions' size. Adjuik et al. [83] presented a Machine Learning approach based on neural network to generate protein vectors for preventing COVID-19.
On the other hand, Qi et al. [84] developed a model using Random Forest and linear regression for predicting the approximate stay of patients in the hospital due to COVID19. Another Random Forest based approach for identifying significant predictors and subsequent risk factors on mortality has been presented by Sarkar and Chakrabarti in [85].
ey have analyzed the clinical data of COVID-19 patients and presented that age is one of the essential parameters responsible for mortalities.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a famous classification approach that can assist in clinical diagnosis in early detection of COVID-19. Batista et al. [86] performed a comparative study of five Machine-Learning-based approaches, namely, ANN, RF, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosted Trees. ey have analyzed the clinical observations of 235 patients and presented all five algorithms' predictive accuracy under consideration. Among these approaches, SVM was able to predict the positivity of COVID-19.
On the other hand, Singh et al. [87] analyzed the daily confirmed cases data of the five most affected countries and presented one-month predictions using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) approaches.

Experimental results have shown the higher performance of LS-SVM by predicting a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases. Machine Learning approaches can be applied to viral sequence datasets for obtaining useful information. In this regard, Bzhalava et al. [88] used Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest techniques for classifying viral and nonviral sequences from metagenomic datasets. Ardabili et al. [89] presented a study of Machine Learning and soft-computing-based approaches for predicting COVID-19. ey observed that Multilayer Perceptron and Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) provided the best classification accuracy for predicting COVID-19. Hasan et al. [90] utilized Q-Q plot and ARIMA model to present the death rate based on time-series data of different states of India. Many other researchers [91-99] have presented the applications of Machine Learning approaches for early diagnosis and predicting the trends of COVID-19. Wang et al. [100] presented the epidemic trend using logistic and time-series prediction model called FbProphet. ey have analyzed the country-level daily COVID-19 data from John Hopkins University. e "Prophet" is a Facebook forecasting model that predicts the epidemic trends based on trend function, periodic term, influence, and the error term. First, they integrated the most recent data into the logistic model and then fed the cap values into the Prophet model to generate epidemic curves. Tuli et al. [101] emphasized the applications of Machine Learning and cloud-computing-based approaches in predicting the trend and the growth of COVID-19 from country-wise data obtained from Our World in Data [102].
ey have applied five different distributions on that data and observed that the Inverse Weibull function provides the best fitting distribution using the iterative weighting

approach. ere are numerous applications of AI in the COVID-19 pandemic. In this regard, Vaishya et al. [103] presented several applications of AI for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. e main applications highlighted by them include early diagnosis, treatment monitoring, contact tracing, cases/mortality projection, drug development, reducing the workload of health workers, and prevention of disease. Kumar et al. [97] analyzed several key parameters responsible for COVID-19 outbreak using two famous Machine Learning algorithms, namely, multiple regression analysis and multilayer feedforward neural network. ey have analyzed several parameters for finding out correlation with two main parameters, that is, total mortalities and total cases. Meraihi et al. [104] presented a critical analysis of several Machine-Learning-based approaches for detection, diagnosis, and prediction of COVID-19. To discover the COVID-19 patterns from recovered patients, a case study of Saudi Arabia was presented by Alafif et al. [105] using Association Rule Apriori (ARA) algorithm.
5.2. Industry 4.0 Based Approaches. e fourth industrial revolution, termed as Industry 4.0, also has the potential to provide solutions to some problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this regard, Javaid et al. [106] reviewed several technologies of Industry 4.0 and explored their applications in minimizing the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. ey have presented the applications of 10 leading technologies of Industry 4.0, namely, AI, IoT, Big Data, cloud computing, Virtual Reality, Holography, autonomous robotics, 3D printing, 3D scanning, and Biosensors, effectively. One of the essential aspects of Industry 4.0 is Big Data, which provides a massive amount of healthcare records, bringing the insight/surveillance of pandemics like COVID-19 [107].
e supply chain sector is one of the critical sectors which was critically affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Potentials of Industry 4.0 can minimize the impact of several challenges on the supply chain sector [108, 109]. Nowadays, the integration of IoT in medical technologies enables easy and transparent monitoring of patient's health [110]. Nowadays, this integration is sometimes referred to as the Internet of Medical ings (IoMT). Swayamsiddha and Mohanty [111] analyzed several applications of Cognitive Radio on IoMT. Modern technologies have several applications in pandemics, namely, disease tracking, health monitoring, predicting protein structures, drug discovery, and social awareness. Kumar et al. [112] and Chamola et al. [113] presented a comprehensive review of such technologies for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, Devi et al. [114] presented several applications of flying ad hoc networks (FANET) during COVID-19 pandemic.
5.3. Statistical Approaches. As compared to AI-based approaches, statistical techniques can provide detailed insights of daily, cumulative, country-wise data of COVID-19. Plenty of research has been carried out by researchers using statistical techniques to analyze the COVID-19 daily confirmed data. Zhang et al. [115] presented automated detection of

COVID-19 using the "AI Intelligent Assistant Analysis System" on chest CT images and statistical analysis using SPSS. eir AI-based chest CTscan analysis was proven to be capable of identifying COVID-19 rapidly as well as accurately. On the other hand, Contreras et al. [116] analyzed the trends and errors of the COVID-19 pandemic using statistical-based approaches only. ey initially defined random variables by modeling probability distribution functions followed by predictions using the ARIMA model.
ey have predicted the discharge rate by studying the cases, especially in Chile. Pandey et al. [117] analyzed COVID-19 outbreak data using Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) and regression. Using both approaches, they predicted the cases of COVID-19 so that preventive measures could be taken on time. Based on RMSLE, SEIR was observed to be outperforming the regression model.
On the other hand, a prospective space-time scan statistic approach to observe the daily COVID-19 data has been utilized in [118, 119]. e authors therein analyzed the daily data by observing the characteristics of clusters at the country level. Sometimes it has been observed that there are chances of delay as well as errors in daily confirmed cases and epidemiological variables. Similarly, Sarkodie and Owusu [120] analyzed the relationship between COVID-19 cases and demises. Along with this relationship, they have analyzed the relationship between several other attributes in diagnosing disease spread. On the other hand, time-series data can forecast healthcare resource requirements by analyzing confirmed and recovered cases [121, 122]. A review of several mathematical and AI-based models of COVID-19 analysis is presented by Mohamadou et al. [123]. ey have observed that most of the mathematical modeling related to COVID-19 analysis was based on two well-known methods, namely, SEIR and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR); meanwhile AI implementation was mainly based on CNNs using CXR and chest CT (CCT) samples. A survey of statistical approaches for analyzing the impacts of COVID-19 on global economy is presented by Verma et al. in [124].
6. Some Public Imaging Datasets for COVID19 Research
Data collection is one of the essential steps towards the identification of any disease using deep-learning-based approaches. Generally, datasets of COVID-19 are categorized into two classes, namely, imaging data and statistical data, as shown in Figure 10.
As the name suggests, imaging data contains a chest CT scan and other radiographic images, that is, X-ray. Few such potential and famous imaging repositories for COVID-19 research are presented in Table 3. Few other datasets can be found in [125].
is type of data provides detailed insights into lung infections due to COVID-19, and the same can help in recognizing the disease. On the other hand, statistical data represents information like the total number of COVID-19 cases, total deaths, recovered cases, recovery rate, mortality rate, state, country-wise cases, and so forth. Most of the statistical data is about daily confirmed cases, which can be

obtained from [102, 132, 133]. Mohamadou et al. [123] have also provided 24 datasets (mix of text, images, prevalence rate, etc.) that can also be used for detection and classification of COVID-19 research. Such type of data helps in calculating and predicting the COVID-19 outbreak. In a brief period, several repositories containing CT scan images and X-ray have been reported. However, every work related to deep learning presented in the preceding sections is based on either CT scan or X-ray images. Most of the datasets are growing day by day as per the availability of new data.
7. Discussion
For better understanding of the works done by several researchers on the fight with the COVID-19 outbreak, it is essential to present a comprehensive survey of their insights. It is clear from the several works presented in this study that researchers are encouraged by the potential of deep-learning-based approaches in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. No doubt, deep learning has been successfully applied in solving various real-life problems. On the other hand, there are several pros and cons of using deep-learning-based approaches for solving problems. Some of them are pointed as follows.
7.1. Pros of Using Deep-Learning-Based Approaches. As compared to manual identification and recognition of diseases, deep learning provides several advantages if enough data is available for training. A few of the advantages are mentioned as follows:

(1) Requiring less amount of time for screening patients after completion of training.
(2) Providing the facility of automatic feature extraction even from unorganized data.
(3) Learning from examples. (4) Higher accuracy as compared to manual
examination.
7.2. Cons of Using Deep-Learning-Based Approaches. Despite several advantages, deep learning approaches also possess various limitations. A few of them are mentioned as follows:
(1) Inability to distinguish between several types of pneumonia.
(2) Lack of transparency and interpretability (sometimes it is hard to determine what imaging features are being used to determine output) [28].
(3) e gap between the responses of lungs concerning different diseases. No method can present various types of lung infections and their diseases (also cannot impact of other parameters such as age, immune status, drug reactivity, smoking, etc.)
(4) Deep-learning-based approaches generally expressing positivity or negativity of a disease but not able to predict the severity of a disease.
(5) Challenging to predict the output based on low quality/contrast images.

(6) Requiring a massive amount of data. Complex algorithms demand a high configuration of machines in CPU, Main Memory, dedicated GPU, and so forth.
7.3. Open Research Issues. It has been observed that in most of the works in which deep learning models and their variants were used, they were utilized mainly for binarized classification, that is, predicting the positivity and negativity of having COVID-19. Still, there exist several open research issues that need to be resolved over time:
(1) Considering real-world data while predicting and forecasting the epidemic trends because it has been observed that most of the predictions models were unable to predict the actual trends of COVID-19.
(2) Predicting the severity of disease using multiclass classification.
(3) Reducing the healthcare burden, especially that on health workers, using AI-enabled approaches.
(4) Predicting and forecasting mortalities, medical equipment, ICU/bed requirements, and other essential requirements.
(5) Development of hybrid datasets with enriched epidemical characteristics.
(6) Enhancing the prediction accuracies and deploying real-life solutions for coping with the COVID-19 outbreak.
(7) Analysis of social media trends along with real-time data in predicting the COVID-19 outbreak.
(8) Deploying AI-based postpandemic solutions that can minimize the impact and improve nations' economies.
8. Conclusion
e COVID-19 outbreak has affected almost all countries. For better prevention, timely diagnosis, social distancing, and isolation are the foremost requirements. Due to the rapid and exponential increment in COVID-19 cases, radiologists and hospitals are overburdened. Accurate and timely detection of 2019-nCoV is foremost required for reducing the burden on the healthcare sector. It is observed that AI-based examinations on CT scan and X-ray images are playing an essential role in diagnosing COVID-19. Nowadays, most of the radiologists are taking advantage of such approaches. e work embodied in this paper is focused on works done by several researchers using AI and deep-learning-based approaches for COVID-19 identification from two primary imaging modalities, that is, CT scan and X-ray. Most of the works reported for COVID-19 identification using deep learning approaches are based on the concept of transfer learning. However, a few of the researchers have developed their novel CNN architectures and claimed good accuracies. ere is no doubt that deeplearning-based approaches save the potential amount of time in screening COVID-19 patients. However, diagnosing diseases from imaging data alone does not fulfill the

minimum requirements. us, it is foremost required to combine these imaging diagnoses along with clinical observations for accurate and efficient diagnosis of COVID-19 so that we can try to minimize its outbreak. In the future, the task of automated COVID-19 identification may be extended towards severity identification and increasing the classification accuracies.

Addressing mental health through intersectoral action in the context of COVID-19 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
Erica Di Ruggiero

COVID-19 continues to challenge all countries around the globe. The pandemic has clearly exposed pre-existing weaknesses in our social, economic and health systems. The wicked problems that the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) called on all nations to comprehensively address are the very issues that have put many people at greater risk for contracting, dying or now contending with the consequences of long COVID19. The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda also pledges to "Leave no one behind" (1). To do so requires explicit attention to dismantling systems of oppression such as sexism, heterosexism, ableism, classism and ageism that continue to socially reproduce racial, gender, health, and other inequities.
Mental health is one of the many issues that the pandemic has further highlighted. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), "mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community" (2). The promotion of mental health is foundational to personal, community and socioeconomic development. The social and economic consequences of ill mental health affect the fabric of entire societies (3). While not new, the pandemic has accelerated attention to the importance of mental health and related inequities, but will this attention be maintained and translated into sustainable action?
The achievement of global mental well-being requires interdisciplinary, intersectoral and intersectional approaches. Mental health clearly aligns with SDG3 (good health and well-being); however, it is influenced by several other SDGs, and this is where the emphasis needs to be - at the intersections of multiple SDGs rather than perpetuating siloed approaches to mental wellbeing. As a health promotion community, we are

well-positioned to co-design, implement and evaluate intersectoral policy and program initiatives that tackle the individual, social, structural, and environmental determinants of mental health inequities. For example, the realization of mental health and well-being is very much related to SDG5 (to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls) and SDG8 (to "promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all") (1). Women's mental health has been deeply affected by the pandemic, but they are also crucial to recovery efforts. They make up more than 70% of the global health and care workforce (4). They are also more likely to perform unpaid care and domestic work which UN Women estimates to be between 10% and 39% of the Gross Domestic Product. Yet much of this labor is not formally accounted for, continues to remain invisible and its mental health impacts have not been adequately assessed (5).
Unpaid care work is a gendered phenomenon. It represents a critical but undervalued dimension of economic activity, with important dividends for the well-being of individuals, families and whole societies. This work can involve caring for children, older adults and people with disabilities. SDG5 (target 5.4) underscores its importance by calling on all countries to better "recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services and social protection policies..." (1).
Social protection measures do exist and consist of policies and programs designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labor markets. These measures can include income security, child and family health care, and human right efforts advocating for progressive policy and legislative changes. According to the International

University of Toronto, Canada.

Labour Organization (ILO), 71% of the global population does not have access to social protection, which also includes two billion workers in the informal economy. This means that only 29% of the world's population has access to comprehensive social security (6) and the situation has most likely worsened during the pandemic. COVID-19 has taken more than 6.3m lives and also contributed to what the ILO has called an "unprecedented loss of jobs and livelihoods" (7).
Social protection is directly related to efforts to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) (SDG3). Of note, one of the key pillars for UHC is financial protection from catastrophic health expenditures. Lack of access to social protection can force people to go to work even when they are sick. We have countless examples of this during COVID-19. Those who do not have the privilege to self-isolate or stay at home because they do not have access to paid sick leave due to their precarious employment status cannot easily adhere to public health advice. If they get too sick, this can result in social exclusion, loss of income, which increases the risk of poverty for workers and their families - all with lasting mental health effects (7). We need to better characterize who is made vulnerable by precarious working conditions in all their various forms, and to document the health and gender implications on mental health and well-being and to evaluate existing social, health and economic policies that otherwise continue to fall short of protecting those in need (8).
As we build back better and more resilient systems, no one discipline, or sector, can tackle complex issues like mental health and its underlying determinants. It cannot be effectively addressed if sectors including the health sector continue to work in silos. Intersectoral action, which results from aligning resources and strategies between sectors to achieve a common goal, is critical for making progress on the SDGs (9). Without sustained attention, nations run the risk of falling even more behind on realizing these goals. Measurement of the

co-benefits from intersectoral action is key. New
models of intersectoral action are also needed now
more than ever (9). I look forward to seeing more
submissions to Global Health Promotion that focus
on equitable intersectoral policy and program
solutions to address issues like mental health.

ABSTRACT
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions in international communications and travel for academic global health programs (AGHPs) in both highincome countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Given the importance of international travel and communication to AGHPs, the pandemic has likely had considerable impact on the education, research, and administrative components of these programs. To date, no substantive study has determined the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on AGHPs in HICs and LMICs. This study assessed the impacts and resultant adaptations of AGHPs to pandemic realities with the goal of sharing strategies and approaches.
Methods: This study applied a mixed methods sequential explanatory design to survey AGHPs in HICs and LMICs about the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on three program domains: education, research, and administration. First, we surveyed a range of AGHP stakeholders to capture quantitative data on the pandemic's impact. Subsequently we conducted semi-structured interviews with select survey participants to gather qualitative data expanding on specific survey responses. Data from both phases were then compared and interpreted together to develop conclusions and suggest adaptive/ innovative approaches for AGHPs.
Results: AGHPs in both HICs and LMICs were significantly impacted by the pandemic in all three domains, though in different ways. While education initiatives managed

to adapt by pivoting towards virtual learning, research programs were impacted more negatively by the disruptions in communication and international travel. The impact of the pandemic on scholarly output as well as on funding for education and research was quite variable, although LMIC programs were more negatively impacted. Administratively, AGHPs implemented a range of safety and risk mitigation strategies and showed a low risk tolerance for international travel. The pandemic posed many challenges but also revealed opportunities for AGHPs.
Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted AGHPs in HICs and LMICs in expected and unexpected ways. Programs noted some unanticipated reductions in education program funding, negative impacts on research programs, and reduced scholarly output. Many programs reported well-coordinated adaptive responses to the pandemic including, for instance, virtual (in place of in-person) collaboration in research. The pandemic will likely have lasting impacts with regard to education, research collaborations, and administration of programs.

INTRODUCTION
The practice of global health relies on extensive international collaborations between institutions in high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In academia, such collaborations involve research and education as a component of university certificate, degree, and diploma programs. These programs often entail travel between HICs and LMICs to learn and conduct research. To effectively run such programs also requires administrators.
The term academic global health program (AGHP) refers to a spectrum of university-based initiatives that may include both education and research components and may be incorporated into undergraduate or postgraduate studies or within health professions schools. Although global health practitioners and partners have contributed to substantial improvements in public health systems and healthcare delivery and outcomes among vulnerable populations around the world [1, 2], there also have been criticisms of poorly designed programs that circumvent and detract from local healthcare and health professions training systems. Increased awareness about issues of equity and colonialism as well as the pause on international travel precipitated by the pandemic have prompted practitioners to reflect on aligning intent and ethics of global health activities [3]. Global health academics are currently engaged in self-reflection about its historical roots and complicity in colonialism [4].
AGHPs in HICs often develop partnerships with institutions in LMICs that include trainee and faculty exchanges between institutions. These exchanges remain mostly unidirectional with trainees and faculty from HIC programs traveling to LMICs which points to the resource and power imbalances between HIC and LMIC programs. Such exchanges are usually administered and funded by HIC programs and governmental grants [5]. Given the colonial roots of global health, AGHPs in HICs are usually more embracive of the notion of global health and they are more numerous and better resourced than programs in LMICs.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the global health discipline in both HICs and LMICs, disrupting delivery of educational materials, development and implementation of research, and administration of program operations. Funding has often been cut, decreased, and/ or siphoned away from global health programs [6]. Some programs managed to pivot and respond quite agilely, some scaled back operations, and others were compelled to shut down [7]. Research and educational exchanges of trainees and faculty between HICs and LMICs were halted as was international travel.
AGHPs have been reported to be negatively impacted by the pandemic, especially those with faceto-face classroom settings [3, 8, 9]. During the pandemic, many AGHPs adopted virtual learning

approaches that required internet access. However, online learning presents challenges that vary

limitations [12], complications of different time zones for synchronous meetings [13], and, in areas

with no or low internet bandwidth, inability to move programs online [12]. Despite challenges,

virtual learning platforms have been used effectively within specific learning communities to raise

awareness about public health issues, mobilize resources, and provide support without in-person

contact [14].

With roots in tropical medicine, global health research has mostly entailed infectious disease and epidemiologic field research [4]. Often, research has been conducted in LMICs with funding and researchers from HICs, demanding frequent travel from HICs to LMICs. With severe disruptions in international travel during the pandemic, such research in AGHPs has been impeded and funding stopped, put on hold, or moved to other university programs [15]. Challenges to research during the pandemic included inability to meet in-person to conduct and discuss research; compromised research proposal review processes; and challenges to establishing collaborative networking at conferences [13].

Global health research programs initiated and funded in HICs are serviced by administrative offices that oversee grants, legal, safety, risk mitigation, and other operational and travel issues. AGHP administrative offices have been affected by the pandemic with some programs downsizing and others reportedly closing [9].

The pandemic impacted the research, education, and administrative arms of AGHPs. However, to date there has been no international survey to understand better how AGHPs worldwide have been impacted, have responded and adapted, and may emerge and change practices as the pandemic ebbs and flows. The aim of this study was to better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on AGHPs regarding (1) education, (2) research, and (3) administrative program challenges and opportunities, and to distill lessons learned into guidance for AGHP leaders and stakeholders.

METHODS
This study employed a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design. We used international global health and medical education associations' listservs to invite educators, researchers, and administrators associated with AGHPs located in mostly high-income countries to complete an online survey and/or participate in a 30- to 40-minute semi-structured virtual interview. Due to the widespread, general outreach of our recruitment method and the anonymity of the survey, there may have been a few survey responses from the same AGHP. The associations we contacted were the following: Association of Medical Education in Europe (AMEE), The Japan Society for Medical Education, Association of American Medical Colleges Visiting Student Learning Opportunities Global Network, Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH), Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada (AFMC), Korean Association of Medical Colleges (KAMC), Bellagio Global Health Education Initiative (BGHEI), and ECFMG GEMx program/AFREHealth. These associations represent the medical education and global health associations globally which the authors contacted and were given access to. We administered the survey and interviews in English. Inclusion criteria required identification as an educator, researcher, or administrator in an AGHP. The definition of AGHP, as stated in the Introduction, did not vary by country.
The survey was divided into four sections: demographics, educators, researchers, and administrators. Question types included nominal measures, binary measures, multiple choice questions, Likert scales, and comment boxes. All participants responded to questions in the first section, (demographics) and responded to questions in the section(s) that corresponded to their self-identified role(s) in their AGHP: educator, researcher, and administrator. In the education section, domains of inquiry included: educational content, delivery, funding and scholarly output. Research domains included: budget allocation, grant funding, scholarly output, and virtual collaboration. Administration included: program operations including travel and risk mitigation for clinical and non-clinical program participants.

World Bank categories (https://data.worldbank.org/country). Since participants received only

questions that corresponded with their role(s), we converted the proportion of respondents for

each answer to a percentage of the total participants who received that question.

Interviews were conducted to further explore insights that appeared in survey data analysis as well as to gain additional insights not captured in the survey. We built the interview guide upon initial review of the quantitative data. Two co-authors conducted semi-structured interviews via Zoom at a time that was convenient for the participant. Written notes were taken during interviews, and audio recordings were made with the permission of the participants so that we could refer to the raw data if questions arose during analysis. We analyzed interview notes using a loose thematic analysis approach.

Ethics approval was received from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, IRB #210010. All survey and interview participants consented to participate in the study.

RESULTS
We present results specific to each research question under the relevant headings. Results are reported as the number (n) followed by percentage (e.g., HIC n: %; LMIC n: %). Additionally, although the goal of the study is to examine AGHPs globally and not compare the responses from HICs and LMICs, contrasting these sets of data yielded important insights and provided helpful perspectives. Therefore, we make such comparisons throughout the analysis while aware of the imbalance of the datasets (i.e., 85% of responses are from HICs) and limitations this poses on the validity of the comparisons.

PHASE 1 - QUANTITATIVE: SURVEY ANALYSIS
DEMOGRAPHICS AND PROGRAM STRUCTURES (TABLES 1 AND 2)
Survey respondents and interviewees represented 36 countries across seven geographical regions (Table 1). A total of 230 representatives of AGHPs responded to the survey. Of these, 196 (85%) respondents worked at institutions in HICs and 34 (15%) worked at institutions in LMICs (Table 2). For the qualitative portion, 29% of interviewees were from LMICs. Most respondents identified as global health educators (HIC 138: 70%, LMIC 14: 41%). Smaller numbers identified as global health researchers (HIC 70: 36%; LMIC 8: 24%) and administrators (HIC 89: 45%, LMIC 9: 26%). Programs across HICs and LMICs hosted both undergraduate and graduate courses in global health, for credit and not for credit.
Before the pandemic, more AGHPs in HICs than LMICs (77% vs. 59%) offered their trainees international learning or research opportunities.
EDUCATION (TABLE 3)
Program coordination Most educators in HICs (107; 77%) stated that their program's response to the pandemic was well-coordinated or moderately well-coordinated, compared with educators in LMICs (8: 57%). Educators who reported their program's responses as inadequately coordinated or uncoordinated (HIC 31: 23%, LMIC 5: 36%) attributed such observations to their program's lack of central coordination or leadership support, or to cancellations of classroom activities. In HICs, major changes in education programs included: changing education delivery methods (109: 79%) and implementing different ways of engaging with partners (95: 69%). In LMICs, major changes were made in education delivery methods (10: 71%) and educational content (8: 57%).

Distance learning Educators reported that prior to the pandemic, their programs sometimes (HIC 59: 43%, LMIC 2: 14%) or rarely/never (HIC 52: 38%, LMIC 7: 50%) used distance learning for curricular delivery. Educators were varied in their plans to continue online education post-pandemic. Some educators hoped to return to in-person trainings, while others planned to continue online training.
Funding Educators' responses about the impact of the pandemic on institutional funding allocations varied. For some there was no change in funding (HIC 41: 30%, LMIC 4: 29%). HIC educators reported moderately (20: 14%) or significantly (35: 25%) reduced funding whereas LMIC educators were mostly not sure about changes in funding (6: 43%).
Scholarly output Regarding scholarly output, most educators reported output had been moderately decreased (HIC 40: 29%, LMIC 3: 21%). Similar percentages in HICs reported no change (HIC 39: 28%, LMIC 1: 7%), while few reported that output was moderately (HIC 24: 17%, LMIC 1: 7%) or considerably (HIC 5: 4%, LMIC 0: 0%) increased.
Travel Educators in HICs reported a high level of outgoing travel (92%) and incoming visitor (66%) suspension as well as implementing different ways of engaging with international partners (69%). In LMICs, only 21% suspended outgoing and/or incoming travel, and 14% implemented different ways to engage.
RESEARCH (TABLE 4)
Impact on research Seventy-five percent of researchers in LMICs but only 34% of HIC researchers reported that the pandemic had a very significant impact on global health research programs at their institutions whereas more researchers in HICs reported moderately significant impact (HIC 29: 41%, LMIC 1: 13%).
Funding In HICs, 29% of researchers reported no change in external funding and 32% were unsure of funding changes. Similarly, 25% of researchers in LMICs were unsure of changes. Regarding institutional funding, 16% of researchers in HICs reported that the pandemic had significantly reduced funding and about two-thirds of researchers reported no change (36%) or unsure of the impact on funding (31%). In contrast, in 63% of researchers in LMICs reported that the pandemic had significantly reduced such funding.

Scholarly output Regarding scholarly output, similar percentages of researchers in HICs and LMICs reported no change (HIC 14: 20%, LMIC 1: 13%), but a higher percentage of researchers in LMICs (50%) than in HICs (19%) reported considerably decreased scholarly output.
Virtual collaboration Many researchers suggested that virtual collaboration could entirely (HIC 4: 6%, LMIC 2: 25%) or somewhat (HIC 49: 70%, LMIC 3: 38%) replace in-person global health research collaborations. However, others did not believe virtual replacement to be feasible (HIC 12: 17%; LMIC 3: 38%).

Similar percentages of respondents in HICs and LMICs (around 67%) suggested that the decision for international travel to resume would rest on an approved vaccine being available; the destination country having acceptable low COVID-19 incidence rate; and/or the destination country having adequate public health resources to manage cases. The decision to allow faculty and trainees from other countries to visit followed an analogous pattern (proof of vaccination; negative test on arrival; safe travel routes and layovers).

PHASE 2 - QUALITATIVE: THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF INTERVIEWS
We received 23 responses expressing an interest in being interviewed (10% of the number who responded to the survey). From these, we secured interviews with 17 individuals of whom 4 (29%) were from LMICs, reflecting a similar HIC:LMIC ratio of respondents as in the survey. However, no individuals from the South American or European regions expressed interested in being interviewed.
We present here a loose thematic analysis of the interview data (including direct quotes from interviewees) - first the general responses of interviewees are presented, and then those from their self-identified program roles: education, research, administration.
General response to impact of the pandemic As in the survey, most interviewees reflected that their program's response to the pandemic was coordinated moderately well or well. Key components of such coordination revealed in the interviews included resources for online teaching, program flexibility, proactive leadership, and effective communication. Communication was most often described using words such as "clear" and "transparent." Less positive responses about coordination included that that leadership was "slow in making decisions" and "unclear about travel regulations" and that "decisions seemed to come out of nowhere."
Education - Impact on virtual learning programs All interviewees described a shift to virtual learning that was motivated by a desire to continue students' successful progression through the program. As a result of moving education online, most interviewees reported few, if any, lapses in educational continuity. As in the quantitative survey, most interviewees in both HICs and LMICs predicted a hybrid model would likely be adopted. Interviewees did express concerns about online platforms pertaining to accreditation of programs and difficulties in getting hands-on training for future health professionals.
An insight not revealed in the survey but expressed in both HIC and LMIC interviews was how crucial and helpful information technology (IT) departments had been during the pandemic. However, some programs in LMICs found the shift to online learning difficult due to lack of internet connectivity and access to computers. One LMIC interviewee stated, "We do not plan to do virtual teaching when we don't have to. We have no funds to give students laptops, so that is an issue."
Research - Scholarly output Interviewees described a range of ways that their research was impacted. A LMIC interviewee commented that, "Every corner of research was affected... We lacked reviewers who could log into the online platforms used." Most interviewees agreed that online platforms would be incorporated to some extent in future research collaborations although drawbacks to online collaborations were reported, including limited social interaction, poor internet connectivity, lack of necessary tools and resources, and limited conference networking to find collaborators.
For clinician researchers, the increased burden of clinical work during the pandemic severely detracted from scholarly output. Other interviewees suggested that their scholarly output fluctuated and initially improved when the pandemic subsided over the summer of 2021 but worsened with the ensuing Delta surge. Two interviewees remarked that bench research was also impacted, especially prior to availability of the vaccine when most researchers were compelled to stay home.

One researcher remarked that it was too early to assess the impact on scholarly output since many articles were "backlogged for peer review and acceptance into journals" due to the increased number of submissions during the pandemic. Moreover, some published articles "bypassed peer review" and this presented a "challenge to academic scholarship standards." One interviewee suggested that scholarly output was improved due to researchers "having more time working from home."
Funding - Impact on global health programs As in the survey, interviewees' responses to questions about funding were quite varied although responses appeared somewhat more positive than in the survey. Most interviewees suggested the pandemic had little to no impact on internal institutional funding for global health programs. Several remarked that funding shifted from global health projects to those directly associated with the pandemic. Some programs reported receiving additional institutional support for innovative programs, including funding for tutoring and mentoring of nurses working in resource poor communities.
As in the survey, several interviewees in HICs corroborated that funding for travel to LMICs was lost. Some programs lost institutional funding for student travel grants, while others will be able to carry over funds to a new fiscal year, thereby increasing future support for students. During the pandemic one participant temporarily lost an external global health scholarship but was informed it would be "re-instituted" when the pandemic was resolved but the interviewee "did not let the funding changes impact my own research... I went ahead and used my own financial resources."
Less travel also created more time for data analysis and project innovation and leftover funds were diverted to research. In cases where researchers already had established collaborations with whom they could communicate via online platforms, scholarly output was less impacted by funding.
Administrators - Risk tolerance and safety All except one HIC interviewee reported a low risk level for international travel. One HIC program reported not allowing any travel even within the country. Some programs that disallowed international student travel, focused on local ("glocal") health initiatives in local low resource settings or pivoted to remote internships. LMIC programs were generally more risk tolerant than HIC programs. Reflecting the survey data, most programs did not report a higher risk tolerance between clinical and non-clinical travel requests.
Programs with medium tolerance based their risk evaluation on the following criteria: vaccination status of their students/faculty and host partners, adherence to safety protocols, use of PPE and masks, COVID-19 testing availability, and institutional committees to evaluate travel requests. Two interviewees reported changing risk tolerance based on the decreased number of COVID-19 cases in the country.
Open, unstructured reflections At the conclusion of the interviews, interviewees were asked if there was anything else about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their global health program they would like to share. The responses were categorized into positive (14) and negative (8) responses.
Positive impacts included new and creative uses of technology, dedication and commitment of global health staff, pivots and changes in the curriculum, program alignment with learning objectives, and new opportunities provided during the pandemic. Additionally, shifting priorities included embracing global and local elective courses and program focus, committing to international partners, and increasing focus on decolonizing global health.
Negative impacts included the deleterious effect on mental health of health care workers and the overall stress and strain on all personnel. Some reflected on the loss of colleagues to COVID-19. Others reflected on the impact on students, including that first-year medical students missed

the opportunity to bond with classmates. At one institution, applications to their medical school had declined due to COVID-19 and the restrictions placed on international travel. In reviewing interview data, it was difficult to distinguish if these impacts were specific to the AGHP or institution wide.

DISCUSSION
The geographical representation of survey responses was extensive. Most respondents reported that the pandemic had a significant impact on their programs with respect to education, research, and administration. Of interest, almost a third more HIC than LMIC programs reported a higher level of coordination. These differences may have reflected relative differences between HICs and LMICs in available resources and capacities to respond to an emergency like the pandemic.
The level of coordination applied especially to the rapid switch toward online learning platforms. Considering that around 40% of respondents reported rarely or sometimes using remote learning prior to the pandemic but now many are using remote learning frequently, and given the paucity of evidence-based literature to guide remote learning, the rapid adaptation to this mode of learning points to remarkable institutional adaptiveness, resilience, and learning agility [16, 17]. Such adaptiveness and agility may be derived from experiences working in the resource limited settings of global health (also termed "resourcefulness learning" [18]).
Respondents remarked that, despite some shortcomings, they were impressed by the benefits of online learning and planned to retain it in some form post-pandemic. This finding aligns with findings of other published studies that showed how programs effectively alternated synchronous and asynchronous online learning and supplemented it with other online messaging applications [13, 19]. Given the extensive use of online platforms and other messaging and applications, it is not surprising that the biggest impact of the pandemic in education was the method of educational delivery (71%) rather than content, although more than half of respondents also reported content changes. As reported by Krohn et al. [20], prior to the pandemic many AGHP faculty lacked experience with online delivery technologies and new learning modalities [20]. Changes in educational content may have been driven by constraints with online delivery methods and perceived need to change content to have relevance to the pandemic.
It is noteworthy that a quarter of researchers in the survey reported that virtual collaboration could entirely replace in-person collaboration, and some commented that they had more frequent meetings online during the pandemic than in-person pre-pandemic. While an increased frequency of online meetings is understandable during a pandemic, what deserves further investigation is how virtual collaboration could completely replace in-person field work. Virtual collaboration may entail little field work with research design and data analyses performed online. If in-person collaboration is considered less vital, the re-aligned role of the HIC research partner also comes into question. Shifts to virtual collaboration raises the potential of reallocating funding previously used by HIC researchers to travel to LMIC research sites. The reallocation of funds, which could include moving extra funding to LMIC institutions, reducing funding since research travel costs are lower, or allocating extra funding to other global health research or education projects. These changes could have significant implications on global health research and programs.
If shifts towards more virtual aspects of research come to fruition, there may be continued shifts towards increased scholarly outputs due to increased time available to write (articles, grants) that was previously dedicated to travel, although this shift will likely be more prevalent among HIC researchers who historically have been the primary travelers in global health collaborations. Overall, it was unsurprising that the impact of the pandemic was more pronounced in the domain of field research than on education given the reliance of global health field research on international travel. Other studies have similarly reported on the, mostly negative, impacts the pandemic placed on global health education and research [15, 21].

Regarding scholarly output, three-quarters of researchers in LMICs and a third of those in HICs reported that the pandemic had a very significant, presumably negative, impact on their global health field research and scholarly output. The more significant impact on LMIC research programs may be associated with their lack of local funding and resources and a dependence on funding from HICs.
The impact of the pandemic on funding of AGHPs was varied and did not follow a pattern. Some reported increased institutional funding (some of which was retrieved from unused travel funds) to develop innovations, research, or establish new programs, whereas others had funds diverted away from global health. Some respondents were understandably not aware of the changes in institutional funding levels as they were not privy to such information. Nonetheless, educators in LMICs were twice as likely as their HIC counterparts to be unsure of change in funding, a finding that may represent the power imbalance in which program funding in LMICs originates in HICs [22, 23]. The fact that about 40% of AGHPs in HICs and more than 60% in LMICs experienced moderately or significantly reduced funding likely reflected differences in available and readily allocatable resources. However, a comment by a LMIC respondent that funding had significantly decreased as it depended on students visiting from HICs was unexpected.
In HICs, it was not surprising to learn that funding for travel was decreased or removed since it could not be utilized. In some cases, funding was carried over to the next fiscal year, suggesting that institutions may have predicted the pandemic to end sooner than it has. Such diversion of global health travel funds aligned with other published reports in which travel funds were diverted towards improving longitudinal global health programs and reduced global health travel was substantiated as a reduction in carbon footprints in the interests of planetary health [21].
A noteworthy difference between the concerns of HIC and LMIC programs to the pandemic (especially regarding research) was that HICs focused on international travel and partner engagement, whereas LMICs focused on their home programs and education/research content and delivery. This focus of HIC programs on travel reflected the predominantly unidirectional travel from HICs to LMICs in global health. However, one might have expected travel restrictions to have had a more significant negative impact on scholarly output in HIC programs. Thus, it was surprising to find that almost one-quarter of researchers reported increased scholarly output. Such increased output could possibly be attributed to the halt on travel that freed up time to write and produce scholarship.
Regarding risk tolerance, HIC program administrators were three times as likely as their LMIC counterparts to report suspending incoming and/or outgoing travel. This finding reflected further the unidirectional nature of global health travel from HICs to LMICs, with LMIC institutions hosting HIC visitors. LMIC institutions may not have felt empowered to halt such incoming travel, while HIC institutions felt they had the power to suspend travel. Furthermore, the power differential between HICs and LIMCs was evident as HIC program administrators were twice as likely as LMIC counterparts to report that they had not determined criteria for incoming visitors but had for outgoing travel, thus appearing to prioritize sending their trainees and faculty abroad rather than receiving international visitors. However, it is also possible that travel decisions for some programs were made at the institutional level, beyond the control of the AGHP.
LIMITATIONS OF STUDY
The study had several limitations. The number of AGHPs in HICs in the world is unknown but high, and our responses represent only a small fraction. Given the low number of LMIC respondents, it is unclear how representative these data are, and the LMIC information could reasonably be regarded as hypothesis generating. This low number is unsurprising, as there are not many established AGHPs in LMICs. A disproportionate number of the study's AGHPs were in the United States of America (USA) (82%), the survey was conducted in English, and the authors are all from USA-based institutions. This structural imbalance between HIC and LMIC AGHPs could not have been rectified by sampling or survey distribution methods. The statistical analyses were descriptive as the skewed ratio of respondents precluded correlational and higher level of statistical analyses.

Nonetheless, the data provided helpful insights into the impacts of the pandemic and adaptive trends in AGHPs in HICs and LMICs.
This study was conducted only in English and may have missed input from other major language groups. The survey was sent to organizations such as the Association for Medical Education in Europe, Japan Society for Medical Education, and Korean Association of Medical Colleges, whose members' primary language is not English. However, given the general ubiquity of English in global health, the survey would likely have been accessible to most, although specific nuances may have been missed.
The sequential explanatory study design entailed a cross-sectional survey conducted over a period of two months followed three months later by interviews conducted over another period of two months. The dynamics and ground situation of the fast-moving pandemic were constantly changing during and between the survey and the interview periods. Hence, the views and responses of study subjects may have changed over time.
The thematic analyses of the interviews were based on notes written during the interviews, which may present biases and a limitation of the study [24]. However, given that the comments of the 17 interviewees were quite disparate, it was not clear how amenable they would have been to coding analysis. Transcription of audio recording is costly and time-consuming [25] and may not be necessary depending on the type of analysis and level of granularity required [26, 27]. For the purposes of this study's sequential explanatory design, written notes provided adequate explanations to the survey findings. Interviewee responses were illuminating and provided explanations that were not captured in the survey, thus substantiating application of the mixed methods sequential explanatory study design.

CONCLUSION
While some of the findings in this study might have been predicted, others were unexpected and are worthy of further comment. An unexpected finding was the immense adaptiveness, learning agility, and innovation that AGHPs displayed in dealing with the pandemic. AGHPs developed a deeper realization of their interconnectedness and a revitalized willingness to learn from one another.
There were similarities and differences in the ways that AGHPs were impacted and dealt with the pandemic. The most notable impact on HICs was travel restrictions. The most notable impact on LMICs was associated with lack of resources and reduction or loss of funding for projects. The differences in the impact of the pandemic on AGHPs in HICS and LMICs could mostly be ascribed to differences in resources between countries, established power differentials entrenched global health practices, and funding of collaborative projects that are controlled largely by HICs.
WAY FORWARD?
The rapid and relatively easy adoption of virtual learning platforms and modalities that AGHPs accomplished (and grew to appreciate) suggested that online learning will remain in some form as part of AGHPs and will continue to be improved.
The gradual realization by AGHPs that intensive travel is not critical for sustaining programs suggested that global health travel may be substantially reduced post-pandemic. This change will likely be supported by the global movement toward "decolonizing" global health [22, 23, 28] but a reduced in-country presence will not fully address the need to shift power imbalances that are prevalent in global health collaborations. It is also likely that new students entering the field of global health will be more involved in local low-resource health settings ("glocal") rather than undertaking international travel for field work in LMICs.
The global health field will likely be transformed considerably by the time the pandemic abates. This transformation will be a consequence of the impact of the pandemic as well as of the transformative movement to "decolonize" the discipline. The value of studies, such as this one, is to gain pre-emptive understanding on how the field may change and to suggest ways of adapting accordingly.

Abstract
Background
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rapidly occurred in Shanghai, China at the end of February 2022, which was not only attacking physical health, such as sleep problems, but also exacerbating mental health. This study aimed to determine the association between sleep quality and psychological distress in COVID-19 carriers in China and evaluate the moderating effects of perceived social support.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1283 asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers from Ruijin Jiahe Fangcang shelter hospitals in Shanghai, China. Participants had an average age of 39.64 years (SD= 11.14) and 59.6% of whom were male. They were assessed using the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) respectively. The Model Templates for PROCESS were used to examine the moderating effects of participants' social support on the association.
Results
In total, 34.3% of participants presented with poor sleep quality (PSQI5); In addition, 41.1% patients showed bad mental health (GHQ3). Sleep quality was positively related to mental health (r=0.30, p< 0.001) and social support (r=0.08, p=0.003). Social support was negatively related to mental health (r = -0.43, p<0.001). Social support negatively moderated the association between sleep quality and mental health (=0.069, p<0.01).
Conclusions
Social support may be beneficial to the improvement of mental health, especially for people in crisis (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic).
1. Introduction
As of May 17th, over 522 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 pandemic have been reported globally. If we deeply dive into the number, the pooled percentage of asymptomatic infections was 0.25% among the tested population and 40.50% among the population confirmed with COVID-19.1 Asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers refer to patients with no symptoms at screening point, which includes pre-symptomatic infections (infected people who have not developed symptoms yet, but go on to develop symptoms later), and true
Page 2/16

asymptomatic or covert infections (those who are infected but never develop any symptoms). 2-3 To control the spread of infection, asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers were collected in the Fangcang shelter hospitals in China. Previous studies showed that admission period had negative effects on physical inactive, sleep quality and eating disorders4-5and 24% of participants reported deterioration in sleep quality.6 These negative changes varied from occupations, healthcare workers reported the highest rate of poor sleep quality.7 Apart from sleep problems, the uncertainty and isolation of COVID-19 pandemic also brought about mental health issues, including anxiety, stress and depression.5 A study investigated patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 in China, approximately 20.9% and 18.6% of them had anxiety and depression respectively.8 Furthermore, the risk factors of mental health include sex, age, education, occupation, sleep quality mainly in quarantined population.9-10 Therein, sleep quality is a critical contributing factor, in other words, better sleep quality decreases incidence of mental problems, which has been validated in university students,11 the elderly 12 and COVID-19 patients.13
Perceived social support refers to the emotional experience and satisfaction that individuals feel respected, supported, and understood from the society. It might be used to interpret the mechanism of psychological or mental health problems.14 Low levels of social support and sleep quality could lead to mental problems in college students and the elderly.15-16 Previous research has repeatedly emphasized the role of social support in the promotion of mental health.17 Although a substantial number of research found this strong relation can hold across a broad range of samples, such as the disabled, healthcare workers, patients with chronic kidney failure and so on,18-21 a handful of studies have presented different results. A meta-analysis has concluded that for the aged people, mental health was weakly or extremely weakly associated with social support.22 Likewise, it has been claimed that the social support is only related to mental health in females only, not in males.23
This study included social support as a potential intervention factor and sleep quality as a trigger factor to construct a moderation model that examines the underlying mechanism of mental health among asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers (see Fig. 1). Based on previous research, the following hypothesis were proposed: (1) Among asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers, sleep quality will be significantly associated with mental health. (2) Social support has a moderating role in the relationship between sleep quality and mental health.

2. Methods
2.1. Participants
All subjects were enrolled from the Ruijin Jiahe Fangcang shelter hospital, Shanghai from March to April, 2022. COVID-19 was detected by nucleic acid method using a nasopharynx swab. The criterion for a negative result was two consecutive negative results in the patient's nucleic acid tests at an interval of at
Page 3/16

least 24hrs. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) 18-69 years; (2) Positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test results in respiratory specimens and diagnosed as asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers; and (3) A willing to be studied and the ability to use a smartphone. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) A serious mental illness or a combination of severe disorders that could affect anxiety or depression (such as acute coronary syndromes, acute pulmonary embolism, malignant tumors, immune system disease, acute gastrointestinal bleeding and immunosuppressive drugs, such as hormones, taken within the previous 3 months), (2) Women who were breastfeeding or pregnant, or (3) Those who refused to be included or who were the subjects with an investigator's uncertainty about their ability to comply with the protocol requirements. The self-designed questionnaires in Chinese language were distributed through an online survey platform "Questionnaire Star", and the information was collected via WeChat. Demographics for the final sample (n=1283) are presented in Table 1.

2.2.1. Sleep quality

Sleep quality was measured using the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).24 The PSQI is a self-reported questionnaire that contains 19 items and 7 sleep components: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of the component scores yields the total scores, which ranges from 0 to 21 points. Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality. The cut-off value to differentiate between good and poor sleepers is >5 points.
2.2.2. Mental health

Mental health was evaluated using the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).25- 26 The GHQ-12 is a self-reported questionnaire evaluating an individual's psychological distress during the past two weeks. The 0-0-1-1 rating used in the questionnaire means that the first two items selected by the subjects are scored as 0, and the last two items selected are scored as 1, total scores are from 0 to 12; higher scores suggest greater mental health impairment. The cut-off for mental health is 3 points, with scores of >3 suggesting bad mental health. The internal consistency reliability of the GHQ-12 in the present study was 0.83.
2.2.3. Social support

Social support was measured using by the Perceived social support scale (PSSS). The PSSS is a 12-item self-reported measure of perceived social support from three sources: family, friends and significant others. Respondents were asked to report their agreement with items on a 7-point Likert scale.27 Total scores of the PSSS are from 12 to 84, with higher scores indicating higher perceived social support. The PSSS features good psychometric properties.28 In the present study, the internal consistency reliability of the perceived social support was 0.98.

2.3. Date analysis
All the date was analyzed by SPSS 28.0 software. Preliminary analyses consisted of testing group differences among the distribution of demographic characteristics, mental health and sleep quality, using t-tests and chi-square tests (see Table 1). Spearman's correlation was used to test the associations between sleep quality, psychological distress and social support. The PROCESS v4.1 macro (Model 1)29 was used for moderation analysis to test the indirect of social support. When the 95% confidence interval of the indirect effect (a * b path) does not contain zero, the indirect effect is considered significant.30 The statistical significance of interaction items was defined as a two-tailed P<0.05, which was regarded as having moderating effects in the moderation model. The study variables were standardized.

3. Results
3.1. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis

Table 1 provides the demographic characteristics and the distribution of mental health and sleep quality. Comparing the means using an independent t-test and ANOVA, it was found that female presented worse sleep quality (t = -3.52, p=0.000). Over follow-up, the median duration for nucleic acid test result to turn negative was 12.64 days. 34.3% of patients presented with poor sleep quality (PSQI5); In addition, 41.1% of patients showed bad mental health (GHQ3).Table 2 provides the variables' means, SD, and correlations. Sleep quality was positively related to mental health (r=0.30, p<0.001) and social support (r=0.08, p=0.003). Social support was negatively related to mental health (r = -0.43, p<0.001).

4. Discussion

Page 9/16

4.1. Main findings
We examined the potential mechanism underlying the link between sleep quality and mental health in a large sample of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers collected in the Fangcang shelter hospitals. The results indicate that social support has a moderating effect on the relationship between sleep quality and mental health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that clarifies the underlying moderation mechanism linking sleep quality to mental health in asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers in China.
The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that nearly 41.10% of the sampled asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers were found to be prone to bad mental health, which was lower than the ratio of psychological problems in other studies.31 For example, an observational, cross-sectional study of 129 patients with mild to moderate illness from Jiangxia Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan, China found that 49.6% of participants had depressive or anxiety symptoms.32A systematic review and meta-analysis on psychological and mental impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers, the general population, and patients with higher COVID-19 risk published between 1 November 2019 to 25 May 2020. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was the highest among patients with pre-existing conditions and COVID-19 infection (56% [39%-73%] and 55% [48%-62%]).33 This finding was most likely because this study was a survey conducted in Shanghai after the third year of COVID-19 breakout, while other studies started several months or even a year after the COVID-19 occurred. And differences of results may be due to differences from different scales of psychological problems. In addition, asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers mostly have no relevant clinical symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat and other self-perceived or clinically recognized symptoms and son on, which could reduce people's mental stress.
In this study, results indicated that poor sleep quality was a risk factor for mental health for asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers in Fangcang shelter hospitals. A substantial body of literature has shown that stressful life events and outbreaks of infectious diseases, including COVID-19, can affect sleep quality,34-37and 34.3% of the participants suffered from poor sleep quality, which was higher than general population before the outbreak of COVID-19, the pooled prevalence of insomnia in general population was 15.0% in China according to a meta-analysis in 2017.38There is a large amount of data on the effects of sleep quality on mental health in other populations, such as healthcare workers,39 patients recovered from COVID-19, 40frontline nurses.41In addition, the present study demonstrated that patients who perceived lower social support were vulnerable to mental health. This supports prior findings documenting the importance of social support when managing enduring stressors that cannot be quickly and individually worked out.42Social support functions as a buffer for poor sleep quality and bad mental health. For example, those with poor sleep quality following COVID-19 may fail in recuperation and rejuvenation of the brain, which then leads to increased anxiety and depressive mood. Surprisingly, the moderating effect of perceived social support could provide help for patients in response to difficulties.
4.2. Strengths and limitations
Page 10/16

This study has several limitations worth noting. First, this was a cross-sectional study and a causal relationship between sleep quality and psychological distress could not be established. Second, this study adopted a self-rated questionnaire, we cannot exclude the possibility of response bias. In the future research, biological indicator or clinical diagnosis of sleep quality may be used to do evaluation objectively. Third, we could not adjust for other factors that could affect sleep quality and mental health, such as environment, comorbidities, which is good for improving sleep quality and promoting mental health.
Despite these limitations, we believe that our results are valuable as they included a major sample of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers admitted in Fangcang shelter hospitals in China. It is also meaningful to help inform future public health intervention of the value of quality of sleep in preventing and addressing mental health problems.
5. Conclusion
The study demonstrated that the significant impact of sleep quality on the mental health on asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers admitted in Fangcang shelter hospitals. Perceived social support was the protective factor of mental health problems. Hence, it is important for hospitals and health care institutions to provide psychosocial support and intervention for asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers to avoid further impact of the epidemic.

My tongue hurts
Stephen Porter,*1 Michael Escudier2 and Stefano Fedele1,3

CLINICAL

Key points
Geographic tongue is common, rarely symptomatic and not potentially malignant.

Psychological upset can be an aggravating factor for a burning-like sensation in the mouth.

Altered taste, in the absence of a COVID-19 infection, is usually the consequence of plaqueinduced disease or longstanding oral dryness.

Abstract
This series of articles comprise of short reviews of clinical problems relevant to oral health care in the twenty-first century. The present article uses a composite of presenting case symptoms to hypothetically illustrate differential diagnoses of pain of the tongue and why there may, or may not be, links to aspects of infection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).

Introduction
A 54-year-old man was referred to an oral medicine service by his general medical practitioner (GMP) as the patient had been experiencing a stinging-like sensation of the dorsum of the tongue for the past four months. He reported previous sore red patches that seemed to arise and diminish spontaneously for many years but the pain that was causing the patient most distress was the continuous stinging sensation across the dorsum of the tongue. The GMP had initially assumed all the symptoms were due to `thrush' but as nystatin had not lessened the symptoms or signs, he had checked the full blood cell count, haematinics (ferritin, serum vitamin B12 and serum and red cell folate) and random glucose and found these to be normal.
The attending clinicians established that the patient had been experiencing intermittent soreness of the dorsum of the tongue over

the past 30 years. The symptoms comprised intermittent episodes of mild stinging across different areas of the dorsum that accompanied the emergence of red patches that varied in site and size on the dorsum. The stinging was particularly noticeable when the patient ate tomatoes and/or pizza. However, separate to this, over the past four months, the patient had experienced a mild, burning-like sensation across the anterior dorsum of the tongue and noticed a constant metallic-like taste. This unusual taste was present most of the time, generalised throughout the mouth, had no identifiable local initiating factor, but would lessen for a short time following eating or drinking. The taste disturbance did not correlate with any possible acute COVID19 illness. The burning-like sensation had started to reduce in the past two weeks but was arising on the anterior half of the dorsum of the tongue. The patient did not report having a dry mouth or any other abnormal sensations to the mouth.
The patient was an accountant and married with two children, aged 6 and 12 years. He did not smoke tobacco and drank about seven units of white wine per week. He had no notable features in his medical history. He had not had symptoms suggestive of acute or long COVID disease and had received the second dose of the AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine three months before the worsening of

the tongue discomfort and onset of the taste disturbance. His wife and children had not had any symptoms suggestive of acute or long COVID disease. The patient seemed mildly anxious and worried. Clinical examination revealed no cervical lymphadenopathy or enlargement of the major salivary glands. Intraorally, the mouth was not dry and there were no features of long-standing oral dryness, nor evidence of plaque-induced gingival or periodontal disease. All permanent teeth were present other than the third molars (these had been extracted many years ago). The dorsum of the tongue was mildly fissured, particularly at the lateral aspects and there were some areas of circular red areas with a slight yellow-towhite border. The tongue was soft and mobile and there was no evidence of oral mucosal or gingival speckling. There was no clinically obvious local cause for the dysgeusia or burning sensation of the tongue.
The working diagnosis of the red patches and fissuring of the tongue was erythema migrans (geographic tongue), while the working diagnosis of the burning sensation of the tongue and dysgeusia was burning mouth syndrome (BMS). There was no requirement for additional investigations as the only relevant haematological/serological investigations had been found to be normal by the patient's GMP and there were no logical differential diagnoses that required to be considered.

comprised providing the patient with clear information concerning both diagnoses (detailed later). There was no need for any additional intervention with regard to the BMS, while with regard the erythema migrans, the patient was advised to avoid, if possible, foods that caused discomfort to the tongue and to dab benzydamine hydrochloride onto any areas that caused distress.
The patient was reviewed three months later, at which time, he reported that the symptoms and signs of the erythema migrans were continuing but he was now endeavouring to avoid eating foods that worsened the discomfort. The burning-like sensation and metallic taste had gradually dissipated.
Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact upon all aspects of life across the globe. With regard to oral healthcare, the greatest impact has been the cessation of aerosol generating procedures, the need for social distancing within the clinical setting and the need for fallow times when operative clinical services recommenced. There are many other downstream effects upon oral healthcare that include: increased disease burden (including malignancy); limited or no immediate patient access to oral health care; loss of income and employment opportunities of staff; and a fall in morale of many oral healthcare providers. Each of these are well-detailed elsewhere1 but one key aspect that has received scant attention is how little acute COVID disease directly affects the mouth - other than giving rise to altered taste and smell - and how little is known about how long COVID disease will impact upon the mouth and oral health care.
Certainly, in the early phases of the COVID19 pandemic, it was suggested that up to 60% of infected individuals had altered smell and/ or taste sense. These varied between patients and could comprise complete loss of smell (anosmia) and/or taste (ageusia), partial loss (hyposmia; dysgeusia) or distortion of taste (parosmia). No one taste sense is particularly affected.2 The precise duration varied between individuals and could, or can be, longstanding and hence considered part of long COVID disease. The precise cause of this altered sensation is unknown but probably reflects direct viral damage to, for example, the olfactory bulb or neurons of the cleft,3,4 possibly having genetically determined risk factors.5 As yet, there remains no known therapy for

loss of taste and/or smell - now termed postinfectious olfactory function - although a number of strategies to treat this have been suggested.6 Anecdotally, there is evidence that infection with the omicron variant of COVID19 does not give rise to the altered taste and/or smell as frequently as that of the delta variant.
The present patient reported the onset of dysgeusia and a burning sensation. As the sensation was of a burning quality that extended across the entire dorsum, had no identifiable precipitants or relieving factors, was unrelated to the geographic tongue and accompanied by dysgeusia, it was appropriate to consider the overall diagnosis as BMS. This disorder is not uncommon, tends to arise in middle-to-late life, may be more common in women than men and can be associated with a wide range of potential aggravating factors.7 A number of such possible aggravating nonphysical factors have emerged as a consequence of the potential effect of the COVID-19 pandemic upon individuals, their families, and society, hence it is probable that more patients than ever will develop symptoms akin to BMS.
Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the symptom of a persistent altered taste was considered uncommon. Most taste changes are short term, reflect local causes (such as foods, entrapment of food between teeth or in carious cavities, plaque-induced gingival disease [for example, acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis] or acute periodontal disease) and do not give rise to an altered taste throughout the mouth. A persistent and generalised altered taste may be a feature of long-standing oral dryness (of many causes). A metallic taste can arise with some drugs, for example, metronidazole, but the present patient did not have plaque-induced oral disease, was not receiving medication and did not have features of a long-standing dry mouth.8
While there are many other, usually rare, causes of altered taste, it was concluded that this symptom reflected some likely distress - as reflected by the accompanying burning/ stinging-like sensation of the tongue. This was based upon: 1) the patient was outwardly worried; 2) there was no local or common systemic explanation for the symptoms; 3) there was no correlation with any acute or long COVID disease; and 4) the taste sensation was metallic in quality. In BMS, the dominant symptom is one of burning that may be transiently relieved by eating and/or drinking but not improved with simple analgesics. This is often accompanied by other features;

indeed, these are often the more frequent and/ or dominant and may include a burning-like sensation of the tongue and other intraoral sites, a sensation of oral dryness in the absence of signs of a lack of saliva (and/or a paradoxical feeling of `too much saliva') and/or sensation of a lump or restriction in the pharynx.7
There remains no one specific therapy for BMS and related symptoms and while the literature suggests that this is often a problem that may persist for many years, it is often aggravated by a variety of factors, - known or unknown to the patient. While aggravating factors (for example, financial, interpersonal, medical, many others) cannot be miraculously resolved, it is always possible to inform the patient of the diagnosis and indicate that there is no overt disease of the mouth (or indeed elsewhere) causing this symptom. Indeed, sometimes this is enough to dampen down the symptom or indeed resolve it. Where this is not possible, there are a variety of strategies that can be applied in the specialist setting to aid the patient.7 In the present instance, the burning sensation and metallic taste abated gradually over a three-month period. The possible stressors were not explored but in the age of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are many to consider, each possibly unique to an individual. Note that at no point has the term `reassurance' been used. This is perhaps an overly used term in healthcare. Reassurance assumes that a patient is indeed reassured by information - a more appropriate phrase might be `information was provided that met the patient's present self-reported needs'.
Erythema migrans (geographic tongue) is common, affects all genders and ethnicities and probably arises in childhood or early adulthood. The signs (patches of erythema, usually of the dorsum of tongue) may occasionally be brought on by certain foods (for example, chocolate or cheese) and the symptom of stinging may be worsened by hot, citrus or spicy agents. It has few associations with systemic disease. Many individuals with erythema migrans have no associated symptoms and only develop discomfort when they change their diet (for example, eat foods with tomatoes) but for those with symptoms, there is no specific therapy other than avoidance of possible precipitants and application of a local analgesic agent (for which there is no evidence-base). Certainly, this disorder is not due to fungal infection, is not potentially malignant and not related to acute or long COVID disease.

COVID-19

CLINICAL

Of interest, perhaps, is that some national newspapers suggested that erythema migrans was a feature of acute COVID disease - it is not. Acute COVID disease probably makes little direct impact upon the mouth. The small number of reports of possible manifestations of acute COVID are not notably detailed, although areas of non-specific erythema and ulceration of the oral mucosa have been described. Extensive ulceration, probably due to erythema multiforme, has been reported, which is perhaps unsurprising given the wide array of drugs that patients may receive for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection.9,10,11 Oral dryness, described as `xerostomia', is likewise not unexpected, as is gingival swelling, probably due to plaque. At present, the only consistent and well-described oral feature of such infection is post-COVID-19 rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis that has affected individuals in parts of India. This systemic mycotic may cause trigeminal neuropathy and 25% of affected persons have had destruction of palatal bone. It has arisen on a background of diabetes mellitus, high-dose corticosteroids, long-term hospitalisation and vaccination.12,13,14,15 COVID19 vaccines very rarely give rise to any adverse effects upon the mouth.16,17
This case demonstrates a number of key points relevant to oral health care: 1) erythema migrans is common but can be confused sometimes with other disorders that cause pain of the tongue; 2) burning mouth syndrome can be accompanied by a gamut of oral symptoms other than just pain; 3) distress, caused or aggravated by many factors, can give rise to BMS and related disorders; and

finally 4) while acute and long COVID disease have little direct effect upon oral function, other than causing dysgeusia, the very many concerns of living in the age of COVID-19 may sometimes give rise to unusual oral symptoms.

We report the first long-term follow-up of a randomized trial (NCT04978259) addressing the effects of remdesivir on recovery (primary outcome) and other patient-important outcomes one year after hospitalization resulting from COVID-19. Of the 208 patients recruited from 11 Finnish hospitals, 198 survived, of whom 181 (92%) completed follow-up. At one year, self-reported recovery occurred in 85% in remdesivir and 86% in standard of care (SoC) (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.47-1.90). We infer no convincing difference between remdesivir and SoC in quality of life or symptom outcomes (p > 0.05). Of the 21 potential long-COVID symptoms, patients reported moderate/major bother from fatigue (26%), joint pain (22%), and problems with memory (19%) and attention/ concentration (18%). In conclusion, after a one-year follow-up of hospitalized patients, one in six reported they had not recovered well from COVID-19. Our results provide no convincing evidence of remdesivir benefit, but wide confidence intervals included possible benefit and harm.

After the acute phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many survivors experience persistent symptoms, often called "long-COVID" or "post COVID-19 condition"1,2. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines long-COVID as symptoms continuing beyond 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 without an alternative explanation3. The prevalence of long-COVID varies by its definition and duration of followup4. According to a recent systematic review, up to half of patients experience some sequelae at 6 months5. An observational study
among more than 400 hospitalized patients in Italy suggested a lower
risk of long-COVID for those who received remdesivir during hospitalization (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.41-0.78)6. There are, however, no published long-term follow-ups of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on COVID-19 treatments7.

In the randomized SOLIDARITY Finland trial, we evaluate a range of patient-relevant outcomes 1 year after hospitalization resulting from COVID-19.
Results
Patients Between 23 July 2020 and 27 January 2021, we recruited 208 hospitalized patients from 11 Finnish hospitals (Fig. 1), representing 23.4% of the patients treated for more than 24 h in our study hospitals8. At baseline, the mean age of the patients was 58.3 years (standard deviation, SD 13.4; range 25-88 years); 64% were men, and the mean body mass index was 30.6 (SD 6.2) (Table 1).

Exertional dyspnea (at least a need to walk more slowly than usual) occurred in 5% in remdesivir and in 8% in SoC (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.20-1.85; absolute difference -3.3%, 95% CI -12-4.4%). Median EQ-VAS was 75.5 (IQR 67.8-85.0) in the remdesivir and 80 (IQR 67.5-86.5) in SoC group (ordered logistic regression OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.49-1.40) (Table 2). We also found similar scores in the remdesivir and SoC groups in all quality-of-life domains. Regarding the 21 potential long-COVID symptoms, there were no statistically significant differences between treatment arms (Supplementary). Patients often reported moderate or major bother from fatigue (26%), joint pain (22%), persistent respiratory mucus (21%), and problems with memory (19%) and attention/concentration (18%) (Fig. 2).
Discussion
This is the first 1-year follow-up of an RCT on COVID-19 drug treatment. We could not demonstrate long-term benefits for remdesivir in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. After a 1-year follow-up, one in six survivors reported they had not recovered well from COVID-19. One in four reported substantial bother from fatigue. This result is similar to that reported in an Italian observational study of hospitalized patients that reported fatigue in one in three patients at 6 months post COVID-196.
This study has several strengths. First, we recruited one in four potentially eligible patients treated in our hospitals during the study period to our randomized trial8,9; this enhances the generalizability of the results. Second, we achieved a very high follow-up rate (92% of survivors). To increase participation and avoid miscommunication and misunderstanding, we translated the questionnaire into nine languages and used interpreters in phone interviews when necessary. Third, our multidisciplinary team of clinicians (representing eight

different fields), methodologists, and patient partners created a questionnaire that focused on the most patient-relevant outcomes.
The major limitation of our study is the small sample size. Adequately powered studies (with short follow-up) have earlier demonstrated that remdesivir can prevent the progression to severe disease if given in the early phase of the infection9,10. A fifth of our patients were not receiving oxygen at hospital admission. As the short-term benefits of remdesivir seem larger in non-severe patients9, this could be the subpopulation of hospitalized patients who might achieve long-term benefits as well. Patients experienced much lower in-hospital mortality rates in Finland (2.4%) than in the global trial (15.0%) and were therefore a potentially more suitable patient population (likely earlier phase of the disease) for an antiviral drug8,11. However, our subgroup of patients in this phase was too small to inform this hypothesis. We hope that other COVID-19 treatment RCTs, especially the large trials--such as the RECOVERY and PANORAMIC, will also extend their follow-up to evaluate the potential long-term effects of acute-phase treatment both in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients12-14. Finally, we did not have information regarding potential treatments post-discharge. However, as no specific treatment has been proved effective for longCOVID, this may not be a major limitation.
In conclusion, we report the first long-term results of an RCT on COVID-19 treatment. At 1-year follow-up among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, about one in four patients reported substantial bother from fatigue, and one in six felt their recovery from COVID-19 was incomplete. We could not detect any effect of remdesivir on long-term recovery, quality of life, or long-COVID symptoms, but confidence intervals are wide, including substantial benefit and harm. Determining acute-phase treatment impact on long-term sequelae of COVID-19 will require additional RCTs with adequate follow-up.

Methods
Study design and patients We registered the protocol of this follow-up study of the SOLIDARITY Finland trial at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04978259). The trial complies with all relevant ethical regulations, and Helsinki University Hospital ethics board approved the study (HUS/1866/2021). This study conforms to the CONSORT 2010 guidance.
We evaluated a range of patient-relevant outcomes 1 year after randomization. The trial was a pragmatic, parallel 1:1 randomized open-label multicenter trial comparing the local standard of care (SoC) and SoC with intravenous remdesivir. We have earlier published the inhospital (short-term) results of the SOLIDARITY Finland as part of the international WHO SOLIDARITY trial8,11,15.
We included patients 18 years of age with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization (from 11 hospitals in Finland). Patients provided informed consent and were not compensated for participation. We excluded patients who had an estimated life expectancy of <3 months, another acute severe condition during the past week, liver enzyme levels more than five-fold over the upper reference limit, severe kidney failure, or who were pregnant or breastfeeding, or participated in another trial10. The WHO SOLIDARITY trial did not perform separate sample size calculations for each participating country8,15. The SOLIDARITY Finland recruited patients to the remdesivir trial until the WHO halted the trial11. We randomized patients (and collected data) using web-based Castor EDC software

(https://www.castoredc.com). Patients in both groups received SoC. In addition, patients in the remdesivir arm received 200 mg of remdesivir on the first day and 100 mg per day until discharge or for a maximum duration of 10 days.
Patient outcomes Our multidisciplinary team of clinicians, methodologists, and patient partners (TR, JS) participated in developing the study design and the questionnaire used to assess long-term recovery (analyses were also stratified by the need of oxygen therapy at randomization) and symptoms (Supplementary). We translated questionnaires, consent forms, and information leaflets from Finnish to Albanian, Arabic, English, Estonian, Persian, Russian, Somalian, and Swedish. We used the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale to assess exertional dyspnea, and the EQ-5D-5L and the visual analogue scale (VAS) scale to measure mobility, self-care, usual daily activities, general pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, and an overall impression of health (Supplementary). We recorded inhospital deaths in the Castor system, and obtained subsequent death dates up to March 2022 from the Digital and Population Data Services Agency (Helsinki, Finland).
Statistical analysis All analyses were unadjusted, intention-to-treat analyses. Statistical significance was defined as an alpha level of 0.05, and

two-sided p values were reported. EQ-5D-5L, questions on recovery, and exertional dyspnea had five options ranging from no symptom or problems up to extreme burden from symptom or problems. The questions on potential long-COVID symptoms, including fatigue or problems with attention and concentration, had four response options: no symptom/bother, symptoms with small bother, moderate, and major bother. We made comparisons using the two broad symptom categories (no/small vs. moderate/ major bother). We performed all analyses using RStudio version 1.4.1106, and calculated relative risks with 95% CI using the Epi package. The EQ-VAS ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). We analyzed the VAS scale in deciles using ordered logistic regression with the MASS package.

Potential clinical and economic
benefits of remote deep brain
stimulation programming
Dávid Pintér1,2*, Evelyn Járdaházi1, József Janszky1,2 & Norbert Kovács1,2
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) teleprogramming may help reducing travel-related and other financial burdens for patients and maintaining DBS care in special situations. To determine travel-related burdens of DBS patients and explore effects of COVID-19 on DBS care. Travel- and visit-related data of 319 patients were retrospectively analyzed for the first year, five years, and ten years after initiating DBS. Frequencies of in-person and telemedicine visits over the 18-month periods just before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hungary were also compared. Average travel distance during an in-person visit was 415.2±261.5 km, while average travel time was 342.1±199.4 min. Travel costs for the first year, five years, and ten years were 151.8±108.7, 461.4±374.6, and 922.7±749.1 Euros, respectively. Travel distance, age, and type and severity of disease could help identify patients who would particularly benefit from teleprogramming. We detected a significant decrease in the number of visits during COVID-19 pandemic (from 3.7±2.1 to 2.4±2.7; p<0.001) which mainly resulted from the decreased frequency of in-person visits (3.6±2.0 vs. 1.7±1.8; p<0.001). Our results support the introduction of DBS teleprogramming in Hungary which could save money and time for patients while maintaining a secure delivery of DBS.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders (MD) resistant to ­pharmacotherapy1-3. Recently, DBS systems have undergone a remarkable technical evolution. Among several innovations, development of remotely programmable systems has been a considerable step towards resolving several issues of postoperative ­care4-10. First, neurostimulation therapy is usually available only in highly specialized, mostly tertiary MD centers. Therefore, many patients who are treated with DBS have to travel long distances to receive medical care which can impose high expenses and inconvenience on patients and take much of their time. Furthermore, long-distance travels may be challenging for patients with mobility issues and require the help of caregivers. However, especially after the initiation of the stimulation and as the disease progresses, reprogramming of the DBS device may be necessary from time to time. In many cases, the caregivers have to take a day off from their workplaces to be able to accompany the patients for these visits. Second, because of the long distance between the home of the patient and the center, the resolution of stimulation- and device-related problems may take a longer time than optimal. It is sometimes also difficult to keep to appointment times and patients, therefore, need to spend more time than planned at the clinic. Finally, some patients who would be eligible candidates for DBS treatment may refuse to undergo the surgery because of the long-distance, timeconsuming, and costly travels after the initiation of stimulation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitalization of the healthcare. Telemedicine has been introduced in many countries, also including Hungary. In cases of the approximately 1000 Hungarian patients with movement MDs treated with DBS, only teleprogramming has been missing to fully complete all major aspects of neurological care. During COVID-19, remote programming has already been shown an efficient and timely

procedure for maintaining the delivery of DBS ­therapy4-7. Among the producers of DBS devices, Abbott has been the first introducing a new technology (NeuroSphereTM) allowing patients to communicate with their neurologists and receive DBS adjustments from home or another location with WiFi or cellular access. This innovation was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and got CE mark, after which it has been started being used in the United S­ tates9 and in several European countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany.
According to the first experiences with remote DBS programming and some theoretical considerations, teleprogramming may have several clinical and economic benefits. Among others, teleprogramming could save time and money for both patients with DBS and their caregivers. To in-depthly examine this potential advantage of teleprogramming and explore factors that could help identify patients who would benefit from teleprogramming to a greater extent, we conducted a single-center, registry-based study analyzing data of all patients who are being treated with DBS in our unit. Additionally, because teleprogramming has been found suitable for maintaining DBS care during COVID-19 in some pilot studies, we also tried to explore the effects of the pandemic on DBS care focusing on patients with MDs in Hungary.
Materials and methods
All study-related procedures were approved by the National Ethical Board of Hungary and the National Institute of Pharmacy and Nutrition (031037/2015/OTIG and OGYÉI/6916/2021). The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Study population. All included patients fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: the subject (1) must have signed an informed consent form approved by the respective Ethical Committees prior to the inclusion in our MD registry; (2) received DBS for a medication-refractory disorder approved as an indication for DBS; (3) had his/her DBS system activated in our center; (4) had at least a one-year follow-up in our unit after the activation, and (5) had at least one in-person visit in our unit during the first year after the activation.
Sources of data. The present study was based on the prospective MD registry of the Movement Disorder Unit of the Department of Neurology, University of Pécs which is a tertiary MD center in Hungary. The registry was approved by the Hungarian Medical Research Council and fulfills all security and data protection requirements. It was used to identify patients eligible for the analyses, and it also served as the source of disease-specific data (e.g., severity of disease) recorded during the DBS activation in-patient visit.
Additional data that were necessary to the analyses (e.g., address of the patient, number of visits in different years) were collected using healthcare information systems that are easily accessible by clinicians and include out- and in-patient visits, in-person and telemedicine visits, diagnostic procedures (e.g., lab tests, radiological examinations), drug prescriptions and refills taking place in both state-funded and private institutions.
Travel-related outcomes were modeled estimates. To determine the travel distances and times between the homes of patients and our MD unit, the route planer called ViaMichelin (https://www.viamichelin.com) was used. In all cases, the fastest routes were considered. In searching options, hatchback was selected for type of car and E5 unleaded petrol for type of fuel. Travel costs were calculated according to the instructions of the National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary (https://en.nav.gov.hu). At the time of the analyses, one Hungarian Forint was 0.0028 Euro, while petrol cost for one kilometer travel was 35.7 Hungarian Forints (0.1 Euro). In addition to fuel costs, road tolls were also included in total travel costs.
During the analyses, only such in-person visits were taken into account where programming changes were performed which could have not been made without an in-person meeting between the patient and the doctor. These included changing the lower and/or upper limits of patient amplitude control at least, however, also more complex adjustments (e.g., changing the contact used for stimulation, the frequency and pulse width of the stimulation or creating a completely new program) in some cases.
Primary endpoints. The main outcomes of the analysis included.
1. The average travel distance from home to our center and from our unit back to home per visit; 2. The average travel time per visit; 3. The average number of in-person visits during the first year, five years and ten years after the activation; 4. The average total travel time during the first year, five years and ten years after the activation; and 5. The average number of days caregivers have to take off from their workplaces to be able to accompany the
patients for visits during the first year, five years and ten years after DBS activation.
Because the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent restrictions might have had an impact on the frequency of on-site visits, data from the period within one year before and the years of the pandemic were not taken into account during the analyses for primary endpoints 3, 4 and 5. In-person visit numbers for 5 and 10 years were determined with projection using the numbers of all in-person visits and the follow-up period on patient level. Primary outcome data were determined for both the whole study population and disorder subgroups [Parkinson's disease (PD), dystonia, and essential tremor (ET)]. Subgroup data were afterwards compared.
Secondary endpoints. In the present study,
1. Average travel costs per visit, and

2. Average cumulative travel costs during the first year, five years and ten years after the activation were also determined.
Data from the period within one year before and the years of the pandemic were not taken into account during the analyses for secondary endpoint 2 because of suspected effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the number of in-person visits. Secondary outcome data were determined for both the whole study population and disorder subgroups (PD, dystonia, and ET). Subgroup data were afterwards compared.
Tertiary endpoints. We also tried to

1a. Representing different disorder subgroups, 1b. Living50 km and further than 50 km from our unit, 1c. Aged65 years and over 65 years, 1d. Having a level of education12 years and more than 12 years, and. 1e. Representing different levels of disease severity according to the Motor Part of the Movement Dis-
order Society-sponsored Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS)11, the Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HYS)12, the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Disability Scale (BFMDRS)13, and the summary index of the Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Q­ uestionnaire14 assessed during the DBS activation in-patient visit; and
2. Assess the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on DBS care, by comparing.
2a. The number of visits over 18 months just before (from October 1, 2018 to March 10, 2020) and after (from March 11, 2020 to September 8, 2021) the declaration of emergency due to COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary (March 11, 2020) independently of the type of visit (in-person or telemedicine visit), and
2b. The numbers of in-person and telemedicine visits considering the same periods before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary.
For tertiary endpoint 2, only data of patients who had their implanted DBS systems activated at least 18 months before the outbreak of the pandemic were considered.
Statistical analysis. Depending on sample size, to test normality, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or the Shapiro-Wilk test was used. Because analyzed data did not follow the normal distribution, for comparing disorder subgroup and travel distance-, age-, education- and disease severity-related data, Mann-Whitney U tests, while for comparing visit numbers before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, Wilcoxon tests were used. To analyze correlations between travel distance and numbers of in-person visits and correlations between disease severity and numbers of in-person visits, Spearman's rank correlations were used. The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using jamovi version 2.2.5.
Results Demographics. Our MD registry included 319 patients who fulfilled all eligibility criteria. They received
DBS mostly for PD (67.1%), dystonia (22.8%), and ET (5.3%, Table 1). Of them, only 54 patients (16.9%) were living in Baranya county in which Pécs lies, while these numbers were 36 (16.8%), 10 (13.7%), and 7 (41.2%) subjects for PD, dystonia, and ET patients, respectively.
Follow-up visits took place between March 3, 2003 and September 8, 2021. The mean follow-up period was 5.8±3.4 years (a minimum of 1.0 year and a maximum of 18.2 years). Of all patients, 279 (87.5%), 169 (53.0%), and 36 (11.35) subjects had a follow-up period of at least 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years, respectively (Table 1). Our patient pool treated with DBS was covering the whole country (Fig. 1).
Primary endpoints. Based on data of the whole study population, the average distance patients with DBS and their caregivers had to travel from home to our center and from our unit back to home per visit was 415.2±261.5 km, while the average time of this travel was 342.1±199.4 min (Table 1). For 31 patients (9.7%), total time needed for an in-person visit without detailed status assessment was more than 12 h, while the number of patients who had to spent more than 12 h for in-person visits with detailed status assessment was 55 (17.2%).
Analyzing data of 298 patients, the average number of in-person visits during the first year after DBS activation was 3.3±1.7, while these numbers projected for five and ten years were 10.5±7.0 and 21.0±14.0, respectively. The average times our patients with DBS and their caregivers have to spend on travel from home to our center and from our unit back to home to have their in-person visits during the first year, five years, and ten years after the activation are 17.2±12.1 h, 52.2±42.2 h, and 104.4±84.3 h, respectively. The average number of days caregivers have to take off from their workplaces to be able to accompany the patients for these visits are 3 days, 9 days, and 17 days during the first year, five years, and ten years after the activation, respectively. However, in some cases, these numbers were found 9 days, 32 days, and 63 days for the first year, five years, and ten years, respectively. Disorder subgroup outcomes for primary endpoints can also be found in Tables 1 and 2.

Table1.Travel- and visit-related data. Data are n (%) or mean±standard deviation [minimum, maximum]. ET=essential tremor; ET-PD=coincidence of essential tremor and Parkinson's disease; PD=Parkinson's disease. aOther types of tremor include dystonic tremor (n=1, 0.3%), Holmes tremor (n=1, 0.3%), tremor related to spinocerebellar ataxia (n=1, 0.3%), and tremor related to multiple sclerosis (n=1, 0.3%). bOther includes epilepsy (n=6, 1,9%), Tourette's syndrome (n=1, 0.3%), autism (n=1, 0.3%), and poststroke hyperkinesia (n=1, 0.3%). cData refer for a one-way travel from the home of patients to our unit. dThis includes time of travelling from home to the clinic, time spent at the clinic and time of travelling home from the clinic.

Secondary endpoints. The average travel cost of patients with DBS and their caregivers per visit was 50.4±28.8 Euros.
Analyzing data of 298 patients, total travel costs for the first year, five years, and ten years after the activation were found 151.8±108.7 Euros, 461.4±374.6 Euros, and 922.7±749.1 Euros, respectively. However, in some cases, these costs can even be 726.3 Euros, 2143.1 Euros, and 4286.2 Euros for the first year, five years, and ten years, respectively. Subgroup data for secondary endpoints can be found in Table 2.

Figure 1.Numbers of patients from different postal code areas of Hungary regarding all patients (A) and subjects with Parkinson's disease (B), dystonia (C), and essential tremor (D).

Tertiary endpoints. Comparing data of PD and dystonia patients, we found that subjects with dystonia had to travel longer distances to our unit (244.7±141.0 km vs. 197.7±122.5 km; p=0.039), however, travel time from home to the clinic did not differ significantly (197.3±106.8 min vs. 163.7±92.4 min; p=0.073). Travel cost per in-person visit was also higher for dystonia patients (58.2±30.6 Euros vs. 48.4±27.2 Euros; p=0.039). Despite higher travel costs, patients with dystonia had more in-person visits in the first year (3.7±1.9 vs. 3.2±1.7; p=0.039), and consistently, first-year data showed higher travel costs for them (190.0±130.0 Euros vs. 141.8±97.2 Euros; p=0.004). The number of in-person visits did not differ significantly for ten years (21.2±13.0 vs. 21.2±13.3; p=0.713), but travel costs remained higher for dystonia patients (1112.6±913.6 Euros vs. 881.7±659.5 Euros; p=0.044).
Comparing data of PD and ET patients, no significant differences were detected in travel distances (197.7±122.5 km vs. 175.8±164.1 km; p=0.459) and times (163.7±92.4 min vs. 153.9±133.8 min; p=0.644). Consequently, travel cost per in-person visit was also comparable (48.4±27.2 Euros vs. 41.5±37.1 Euros; p=0.304). However, patients with PD had more in-person visits in the first year (3.2±1.7 vs. 2.4±1.5; p=0.032), and consistently, first-year travel costs were found higher for them (141.8±97.2 Euros vs. 88.5±85.2 Euros; p=0.030). Both the number of in-person visits and travel costs for ten years remained higher for PD patients (21.2±13.3 vs. 13.0±7.0, p=0.012 and 881.7±659.5 Euros vs. 414.0±422.7 Euros, p=0.005, respectively).
Compared to ET patients, subjects with dystonia had to travel longer distances to our unit (244.7±141.0 km vs. 175.8±164.1 km; p=0.037), however, travel time from home to the clinic did not differ significantly between the groups (197.3±106.8 min vs. 153.9±133.8 min; p=0.151). Travel cost per in-person visit was found higher for dystonia patients (58.2±30.6 Euros vs. 41.5±37.1 Euros; p=0.033). Despite higher travel costs, patients with dystonia had more in-person visits in the first year (3.7±1.9 vs. 2.4±1.5; p=0.010), and consistently, first-year travel costs were also higher for them (190.0±130.0 Euros vs. 88.5±85.2 Euros; p=0.004). Both the number of in-person visits and travel costs for ten years remained higher for dystonia patients (21.2±13.0 vs. 13.0±7.0, p=0.014 and 1112.6±913.6 Euros vs. 414.0±422.7 Euros; p<0.001).
We found a negative correlation between travel distance from home to our unit and the number of first-year in-person visits (Spearman's rho=-0.269, p<0.001) that became somewhat stronger regarding the number of in-person visits over ten years (Spearman's rho=-0.314, p<0.001). Patients living 50 km from our unit (n=56) had more frequent in-person visits during the first year and over ten years after the activation than those (n=306) living further than 50 km (4.3±2.3 vs. 2.7±1.7, p<0.001 and 28.9±18.1 vs. 17.4±12.3, p<0.001).
Number of visits during the first year did not differ significantly between patients aged65 years (n=283) and over (n=79) 65 years (3.0±1.9 vs. 2.7±1.8; p=0.271). However, although subjects aged over 65 years did

not live further from our unit compared to patients 65 years (188±121 km vs. 219±129 km; p=0.061), they had less in-person visits over ten years after the activation (19.7±13.4 vs. 17.1±15.8; p=0.036). Numbers of in-person visits in the first year and over ten years after the activation did not differ significantly for patients with an education level of 12 years (n=215) and over (n=147) 12 years (2.9±1.8 vs. 3.0±2.1, p=0.868 and 18.6±14.6 vs. 20.2±12.8, p=0.090).
Regarding PD, there were negative correlations between both the HYS and the motor score of the MDSUPDRS recorded at the DBS activation visit and the numbers of in-person visits over ten years (Spearman's rho=-0.293, p<0.001 and Spearman's rho=-0.267, p<0.001, respectively). Patients with HYS>2 PD (n=89) had less frequent in-person visits than those with HYS2 PD (n=150) both during the first year and over ten years (2.6±1.8 vs. 3.0±1.9, p=0.041 and 14.4±11.1 vs. 22.4±13.8, p<0.001, respectively). Using previously determined cut-off value for the Motor Part of the MDS-UPDRS between mild and moderate PD (32/33 points)15, number of first year in-person visits did not differ significantly (2.9±1.9 vs. 2.8±1.9; p=0.460), however, patients with moderate or severe PD (n=131) had less frequent in-person visits over ten years than subjects with mild PD (n=108) at the activation visit (16.7±11.5 vs. 22.7±14.9, p<0.001).
Regarding dystonia, we found a negative correlation between the BFMDDS scores recorded at DBS activation and the numbers of in-person visits over ten years (Spearman's rho=-0.284, p=0.009). Number of first year inperson visits did not differ significantly between patients with5 points on the BFMDDS (n=56) and those with

less disability (n=27) at DBS activation (3.1±1.9 vs. 3.8±2.1; p=0.219), however, patients with a disability of 5 points on the BFMDDS had less frequent in-person visits over ten years (17.8±12.2 vs. 23.8±13.8, p=0.037).
Regarding ET, there was no correlation between the summary index of the QUEST and numbers of in-person visits in the first year and over ten years after DBS activation (Spearman's rho=0.049, p=0.826 and Spearman's rho=0.240, p=0.270, respectively). Considering the cut-off values for the summary index of the QUEST determining different levels of ET ­severity16, we found no significant differences among patients representing different levels of disease severity.
To determine the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on DBS care, data of 234 patients could be used. Comparing the total number of all (in-person and telemedicine) visits 18 months just before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, we found a significant decrease (3.7±2.1 vs. 2.4±2.7; p<0.001). To this, the decrease in the frequency of in-person visits (3.6±2.0 vs. 1.7±1.8; p<0.001) could be the main contributor. In contrast, the use of telemedicine care and its proportion of all visits increased significantly (0.1±1.3 vs. 0.5±1.2, p<0.001 and 3.9±7.5% vs. 17.6±27.7%, p<0.001, respectively, Table 3).
Discussion
Although there is an increasing body of research into telecare including remote DBS programming, an emerging novel ­technology4-10, our knowledge is still lacking on several aspects of teleprogramming. In this study, we aimed to explore potential clinical and economic advantages of DBS teleprogramming in Hungary focusing on MDs.
The majority of patients treated with DBS at our unit are nonlocal residents. We found that our patients generally have to travel 208 km to get to our unit which usually takes almost 3 h, while the mean total travel cost per in-person visit is 50.4 Euros, however, in some cases, these can also reach 544 km, 9 h, and 119.5 Euros, respectively. These numbers are smaller than those found by a recent Chinese s­ tudy8, however, regarding this, the difference in the territory of the two countries (93,030 vs. 9,596,961 square kilometers) should also be considered. Assuming that all adjustments after the activation can be made remotely, according to our results on travel costs, DBS teleprogramming could generally save at least 151.8 and 922.7 Euros for patients in the first year and over a ten-year treatment period, respectively, which are about the half and three times the Hungarian net minimum monthly wage, however, these numbers could also be 726.3 and 4286.2 Euros (about a two-monthly and fourteen-monthly Hungarian net minimum wage, respectively). In addition, 3 and 17 days holiday could be generally saved in the first and over ten years which can be important for actively working patients and caregivers who accompany the patients for on-site visits.
In addition to suspected economic benefits of remote programming, our results also shed light on potential clinical advantages of DBS telecare. At our department, the in-person examination time is generally 20 min per patient. During a detailed status assessment which is performed at least annually in our protocol, in addition to a physical neurological examination during the basic 20-min follow-up, further disease-specific scales measuring the motor and non-motor symptoms, the disorder-related disability and the health-related quality of life (e.g., the MDS-UPDRS, the BFMDRS, the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the

Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire, etc.) are also assessed. The basic physical neurological examination and additional tests generally last for 120 min. As a result, for several patients, a greater part of time spent on an in-person visit is not related to the examinations rather to other activities such as travelling which may demotivate patients in visiting to DBS centers. Therefore, teleprogramming could also improve patient compliance at least with annual detailed status assessments--considering that almost all parts of the physical neurological examination and most of the scales used to measure severity of MDs can be performed via video-based consultation which is included in a teleprogramming session--but also with more frequent check-ups. Increased patient compliance might also have beneficial effects on the efficacy of DBS treatment.
According to a recent analysis, televisits have been mainly performed via phone calls and mostly for drug prescriptions in H­ ungary17. However, studies have found that video-based consultation has several advantages over telephone such as fewer medication errors, greater diagnostic accuracy, and improved decision-making ­accuracy18. This tool is feasible for assessing all main motor symptoms of MDs with the exemption of muscle tone and postural s­ tability19,20. In addition, it has been found that patients also prefer video-based consultation over phone ­calls21,22. One reason for the wider use of phone calls compared to video-based consultation can be that the latter requires a more extensive technical background, therefore, its installations and maintenance are more expensive. Because video-based consultation is a fundamental part of the NeuroSphereTM DBS teleprogramming system, in countries where present neurological telemedicine practice is similar to the Hungarian one (e.g., in Norway)23, remote programming could also help to increase general efficacy of telecare.
The present study also tried to determine the groups of patients who could particularly benefit from teleprogramming. Travel distance negatively correlated with the number of in-person visits both on short and long term, however, just after the activation and as the disease progresses, more frequent DBS adjustments may be necessary to maintain desired symptomatic control and quality of l­ife24,25. We found that patients living further than 50 km from the DBS center could benefit from teleprogramming by having more regular DBS adjustments in the early post-activation period and during the disease course. These findings are in line with the results of another recent ­study26, however, it should be also noted that telemedicine usage does not necessarily correlate with travel distance according to other t­rials27, which might imply that independently of travel distance, all patients can derive benefit from improved access to healthcare due to telemedicine. This aspect should be further clarified in future trials.
Additionally, patients with dystonia had to travel the longest distance for in-person visits, however, despite longer travels, they had the highest numbers of in-person visits both in the first year and over ten years after DBS activation. Consequently, travel costs were the highest for dystonia patients both on short and long term. These results may be partly explained by the fact that only few centers provide dystonia care of which our unit is the main DBS center for dystonia in Hungary with an extensive referral network, therefore, a large portion of patients had to travel long distances to have DBS therapy regularly optimized. In addition, after adjustments of DBS of dystonia patients, immediate symptomatic response cannot often be observed and as a result, more frequent programming may be necessary. Considering that our finding supports the results of a previous survey that found the accessibility of dystonia experts difficult in several European c­ ountries28, teleprogramming could also help improving accessibility of DBS care for dystonia.
In our study, patients aged over 65 years or having 33 points on the Motor Part of the MDS-UPDRS and 5 points on the BFDDS at DBS activation travelled less frequently to our unit over ten years. The main explanation for this may be that travelling can be challenging for these patients due to mobility problems resulting from higher age, more severe symptoms, and disease-related disability. However, closer follow-up and regular DBS adjustment would be essential mainly for this patient group. These subjects may on the one hand be more dependent on their caregivers, if they are available, in travelling to their medical appointments which can substantially increase caregiver burden. On the other hand, in case caregivers are lacking, patients may become unable to travel for in-person visits. Considering this, teleprogramming could be useful not just from economic perspectives, but could also help achieving better symptomatic control and higher quality of life and decreasing caregiver burden.
This analysis revealed that during COVID-19, on-site patient care significantly decreased compared to the period prior to the pandemic, however, there was an impressive increase in the requests for telemedicine care. Although telemedicine has had several advantages, DBS adjustments could not been performed remotely in Hungary. Thus, with the reduction in the number of in-person visits, there has been a risk for a decrease in the effectiveness of DBS treatment and as a result, a deterioration in the condition of ­patients29,30. Considering this, teleprogramming could also help maintaining a more secure delivery of DBS therapy. According to an ongoing survey at our center, a high portion of DBS patients surveyed thus far (63 subjects out of 75, 84.0%) would try remote programming independently of (n=45, 71.4%) or due to (n=18, 28.6%) the COVID-19 pandemic. This is in line with the results of a recent survey by the Parkinson's Foundation and Abbott L­ abs26.
This study might have some limitations. First, because we analyzed data only on the Hungarian healthcare system, the outcomes should be used with caution in other countries. Second, the study might have also been limited by its single-center design and consequent effects of center-specific characteristics on the outcomes. For example, possible differences in the protocols of DBS care including remote strategies among centers may be present. In our practice, allowing amplitude modification and change between at least two different programming groups are standards of care, while in some other centers, patients may not be allowed any programming options. However, because our unit is a tertiary MD center, our patient pool covers the whole area of the country, therefore, we could collect and analyze data on the potential clinical and economic benefits of remote DBS programming on a nation-wide level. Another strength of this analysis can be the high number of included patients representing different types and severity of MDs. In addition, analyses were performed not just for the whole study population but also the main disorder subgroups, and we could analyze data from all waves of the COVID-19 pandemic period. At this point, it should also be mentioned that our unit is the main DBS center for dystonia, while DBS for ET is more equally available in Hungarian centers. As a result, patients with dystonia

may be overrepresented while ET subjects underrepresented in our analyses. Possibly lower portion of patients with ET and higher portion of dystonia subjects relative to other units from other countries together with the fact that ET usually shows a good response to DBS treatment even after initial programming settings and less visits are therefore required for adjustments, should also be considered during the interpretation of our findings. options. During the interpretation of our findings, it should also be considered that Last but not least, because the cost per patient is a modeled estimate and not based on any actual data reported by patients, some costs that may occur for some patients (e.g., cost of accommodation for patients cannot travel to site and back to home on the same day due to the long travel distance) or possibility of public transport were not taken into account during the analyses which may also limit the universal applicability of our approach.
To conclude, by revealing several potential clinical and economic advantages of remote DBS programming, our study supports the introduction of teleprogramming in Hungary. With careful interpretation, our findings may be useful for other countries that also plan to introduce DBS remote programming. Patients who live further from the DBS center, are of older age, have dystonia or represent higher level of disease severity and disability could particularly benefit from this technical innovation. However, further analyses from other countries for which our study can be a good basis and data from clinical practice using remote programming could provide a more comprehensive picture of the role and value of DBS telemedicine.

The outbreak of the pandemic Covid-19 has transformed the education system in most countries worldwide. Following the lockdown measures in Malaysia, the Malaysian education system has fully transformed from conventional learning to online learning or known as e-learning as an alternative to minimize social contacts and physical communication to curb the transmission of Covid-19. In this regard, this study aims to identify the challenges faced by students in higher learning institutions throughout Malaysia during the implementation of the e-learning program. This study is based on a large sampling consisting of 2394 students from both public and private universities. The result from this study is analyzed through inferential methods such as the Spatial Analysis, the Principal Component Analysis, and the Mann-Whitney U test and through descriptive methods using the frequency analysis and the percentage analysis. Findings from this study suggest that location significantly influenced the challenges faced by students throughout the implementation of e-learning in higher learning institutions. For example, students in rural areas which can be identified as "vulnerable groups" are more likely to face both technical and connection with the internet access, tend to have a declining focus on learning and are prone to physical health problems, facing social isolation and low digital literacy compared to students in urban areas. Based on geographical analysis, students in Sabah, Perlis, and Melaka are most at risk of facing e-learning challenges. An anomaly case of students in Kuala Lumpur, however, posed another different result compared to other cities as they confront similar challenges with students in rural areas. This study provides the nuances of location and its implications for vulnerable groups that may put them at disadvantage in the e-learning program. Findings from this study will help to inform the relevant authorities and policymakers in improving the implementation of e-learning in Malaysia, especially towards the vulnerable groups so that it can be delivered more systematically and efficiently.

Educational achievement is one of the most important milestones in determining the quality of life. A low level of educational achievement is often associated with shorter life expectancy, poor health, and poor immunity during ­illnesses1. As such, the effectiveness of the education system must be emphasized to assist students' achievement in education as this will affect the quality of their life. This includes reforms and improvements in educational policy and the delivery of teaching methods.
The outbreak of the pandemic Covid-19 which began in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, has changed the educational system worldwide)2-5. The pandemic has shifted from conventional face-to-face teaching to distance learning, or known as e-learning, including education at the tertiary ­level6,7. The shift in the education system took place drastically in the wake of the current need worldwide to reduce social interaction to curb the

transmission of the Covid-198. However, this drastic change comes with hurdles as many developing countries are still new to the practice of e-learning9. Moreover, there are technological, facilities, and technical barriers that are prevalent in developing countries toward the implementation of e-learning. These include inadequacy of information and technology of communication (ICT), poor infrastructure ­facilities9, poor internet ­access10, deficit source of e­ lectricity11, poor living environment to learn at h­ ome12 and low digital literacy among teachers and ­students13.
Moreover, e-learning also poses several backdrops for the well-being of students. This includes mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and ­stress14, physical health ­problems15, social ­isolation12, decreased sleep ­quality16 and negative impact on academic a­ chievement17. However, geography and location also create a further disparity in the challenges of the e-learning system, particularly between rural and urban areas. For example, ­Zhu18 found that there is a digital divide between students in urban and rural areas in China. Almost half of the students in rural areas were unable to follow the e-learning program due to their limited ownership of electronic devices. Additionally, demographic factors have a significant impact in determining the amount of difficulty encountered by students. Cleofas and R­ ocha19 found, for instance, that the possession of computers (laptops and desktops) and low internet connection among college students with low socioeconomic position in the Philippines correlated to high levels of COVID-19-related anxiety.
Therefore, each of the problems and challenges in e-learning should be addressed accordingly using different mechanism empowerment strategies. However, before alternatives or resolutions are taken to minimize the barriers in e-learning, it is crucial to understand the nuances of problems that have been faced by students based on the consideration of their geographical location. This is to ensure the strategy and efforts to improve the e-learning system are more effective and systematic to mitigate the variety of challenges faced by students. Unfortunately, studies related to the challenges of e-learning from a geographical approach, particularly based on the mapping analysis and the differences in spatial aspects, are extremely rare and limited. The geographical approach which refers to the use of geospatial and mapping analysis is vitally important to demonstrate the varieties of barriers in e-learning, uniquely depending on the location, especially in developing countries.
Malaysia is considered a developing country that continues to implement e-learning, especially at the tertiary ­level20. Recent developments on Covid-19 show that the pandemic is an endless crisis and exacerbated by new variants such as the Delta, Omicron and ­Deltacron21. This inevitably became the main factor that led to the continuation of the e-learning system in Malaysia. However, so far, there has been no comprehensive study in the country that addresses the challenges of e-learning faced by students. This would be the main contribution of this study which aims to explore the challenges of e-learning through the utilization of geo-spatial and mapping analysis throughout all states, including the federal territories in Malaysia.
Methods Study design. This study uses a quantitative approach. According to Jones et al.22, a survey is the most
convenient method to accommodate a large sampling size. Therefore, due to the large sampling size, this study applies a cross-sectional survey to understand the challenges of e-learning among students in higher education in Malaysia. To eliminate social and physical interactions to reduce the risk of Covid-19, the data collection for this study has been conducted online using the KoBoToolbox application.
Recruitment procedure. This cross-sectional survey was performed from 21 October 2021 to 6 December 2021. Respondents in this study are drawn from 9 private universities and 18 public universities throughout Malaysia (comprising 12 states and 2 federal territories). The sample size was determined using the purposive sampling technique with 2394 respondents. The minimum sample size to represent the total population exceeding 1,000,000 people or infinity with a 99% confidence level is capped at 463 p­ eople23. Therefore, the sample size for this study totaled 2394 respondents can be considered sufficient to represent the total population in Malaysia and the size has exceeded the required minimum sampling size. This study uses two popular social media platforms in Malaysia, WhatsApp and Facebook, to identify potential respondents.
Study instrument. Some of the survey instrument questions of this study were emulated and modified from previous studies by Kim et al.24, Zembylas et al.25, and Adnan and A­ nwar26. These articles are written in English. The papers include a number of questions that are deemed appropriate for this study. Therefore, some of the questions in the articles (in English) were rewritten with a simpler format (in Malaysian) while retaining their original intent and meaning. The objective is to condense this study's e-questionnaire so that it is easier to understand, and respondents may spend less time answering questions. In general, this survey instrument contains two sections: the background information of the respondents (Part A) and the challenges faced by students in higher education during e-learning (Part B). Each question can be answered in the form of a Likert scale with five answer choices ranging from `1 (= strongly disagree) to `5 (= strongly agree). The total number of questions in Section B is 35 variables. Each of the questions in Section B is constructed in negative. This implies that a higher score indicates a greater degree of difficulty and vice versa. To verify the instrument's validity and reliability can be delivered and utilized in excellent condition, a pilot study with 50 respondents should be conducted ­beforehand27,28. The results of the analysis found that all variables (35 variables) were valid for use since the value of the correlation coefficient (­ rxy) is greater than the critical value for the Pearson's Correlation coefficient r­ 29 The minimum value of the correlation coefficient of this study is 0.299 exceeding the critical value for the Pearson's Correlation coefficient r with a level of significance of 0.5%, which is 0.27330. The results of the reliability test also showed an alpha value of 0.935. This means that the research instrument for this study is suitable due to its alpha value in the excellent ­category31.

Statistical analysis. The collection of raw data is analyzed using the IBM SPSS Version 26. To explain the respondents' background, this study utilized descriptive analyses such as frequencies and percentages. Apart from descriptive analysis, this study analyzed data using spatial analysis such as the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Mann-Whitney U test.
The PCA functions as a data mining technique to summarize the 35 variables of "Construct B" into six components. The objective of the PCA analysis is to find and extract any essential information from the statistical data and to summarize this information as a collection of new orthogonal variables called principal c­ omponents32,33. Since the value of the loading factor (commonality) of Variables B1 and B19 is less than 0.5, both variables had to be removed first before performing PCA analysis for the second t­ime34,35. Bartlett's test for the second time demonstrates that the PCA analysis showed a significant result (2=54959.59, df=528, p<0.05), thus indicating that the sample of in this study was eligible for factorization. The number of components was determined with the help of Scree Plot, as shown in Fig. 1. Based on the figure, six components were produced with eigenvalues higher than ­136.
The cumulative value of variance from 6 components that were produced was 67.78 percent (Table 1). This means that 67.78% of the challenges faced by students in higher education in Malaysia are represented by these 6 ­components37. According to Williams et al.38, in the field of humanities, the variance described was as low as 50-60%. Subsequently, this examination's absolute variance rate should be acknowledged.
The results of the PCA analysis are introduced as a thematic map utilizing the Geography Information System (GIS), where the purpose is to demonstrate the dissemination of examples based on selected t­ hemes39. In order to produce a thematic map, the results of the PCA analysis will be merged with the spatial data. These spatial data were generated from open source which can be found at https://data.humdata.org/. This spatial data indicates the administrative boundaries of states in Malaysia. The State name, which is the primary key of the data, is then used to link these sets of data. The challenges of tertiary students were indicated on a choropleth map that depicts the allocation of values based on the recognition of color tones. A characteristic break then uses

Ethical considerations. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. This study is conducted following the guidelines of the Ethics Committee set by the Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) Review Board (Ref No UMS/FSSK6.2/100-2/2/3). All participants are supplied with an informed consent at the beginning of the online survey. In addition, this study provides written information, including its purpose and objectives in order for the respondent to understand before they participant in this study. There is a guarantee of privacy, anonymity, and confidentiality for all participants.

Results Demographic characteristics. Of the total sample of this study, 1,723 (72%) were women, and only a
total of 671 (28%) were men. Most of the respondents of this study also consisted of students who were married (2,339, 97.7%), Muslim (1,722, 71.9%) and pursued their studies at public universities (2,283, 95.4%). Further information regarding the demographic background of the respondents is shown in Table 2.

Challenges of elearning. The results of the PCA analysis found that students in higher learning institutions faced six main challenges during the implementation of e-learning in Malaysia (Table 3). The main challenge of the e-learning can be seen with the aspect (Co1) of declining focus on learning (var (X)=18.91%), followed by (Co2) the deterioration of physical health (var (X)=12.62%) and (Co3) mental health disorders (var (X)=11.41%). In addition, students also confronted issues with (Co4) technical and internet connection problems (var (X)=10.37%) and (Co5) social isolation (var (X)=7.36%). The last challenge is related to (Co6) which refers to students' inability to follow e-learning (var (X)=7.11%).

Comparison of elearning challenges by state in Malaysia. Based on the assessment of geographical considerations, each locality in Malaysia posed different challenges in e-learning. For example, students in Sabah are most likely to experience problems with technical and internet connection (Z-Scores=0.1758) and low digital literacy (Z-Scores=0.1000) (Figs. 3b, 4b). On the other hand, students in Kuala Lumpur enjoyed the most sophisticated technical and internet facilities for e-learning compared to students in other states in Malaysia (Z-Scores=-0.6373) (Fig. 3b). However, students in Kuala Lumpur are most likely to experience a decreased focus on learning (Z-Scores=0.3347) and social isolation problems during e-learning (Z-Scores=0.2000) (Figs. 2a, 4a). Students in the states of Perlis and Malacca are most likely to suffer from physical health (Z-Scores=0.4226) and mental health (Z-Scores=0.2913) problems (Figs. 2b, 3a).

Differences in students' perceptions of elearning challenges in urban and rural settings. The study also found significant differences concerning the challenges of the implementation of e-learning between students in urban areas and students in rural areas. This includes the aspects of decreased focus on learning (p0.01), physical health problems (p=0.001), problems with technical and internet connection (p0.01), social isolation (p=0.002) and low digital literacy (p0.01). Compared to students in urban areas, students in rural areas are more likely to experience such problems (Co1, Co2, Co4, Co5 & Co6). However, for mental health problems, it was found that there was no significant difference (p=0.297) between students in urban and rural areas as shown in Table 4.
Discussion
Students' geographical location at higher learning institutions has a crucial influence in determining their capacity to fully engage in the e-learning programme. Therefore, to ensure the effectiveness of the implementation of e-learning throughout all states in Malaysia, the government and policymakers should prioritize the overall improvements of e-learning, particularly for students in rural areas. Students in rural areas are more likely at a disadvantage given the variety of challenges they face due to poor basic infrastructure and facilities compared to students in urban areas. In addition, students in rural areas are more likely to experience challenges such as a

deteriorating focus on studying, physical health issues, technical difficulties, a poor internet connection, social isolation, and a lack of digital competence in e-learning programme than students in urban areas (Refer to "Differences in students' perceptions of e-learning challenges in urban and rural settings" section). The results of this study are consistent with several previous research findings that students in rural areas are more commonly faced with technical issues and connection ­problems11 as well as low digital ­literacy41 during the implementation of the e-learning program.
A careful and detailed assessment of this study showed that students in Sabah scored the highest technical fault, poor internet access, and scored the lowest digital literacy (refer to Figs. 3b, 4b). This is not a surprise as Sabah is the poorest state in ­Malaysia42. Most of the districts and towns in Sabah are considered rural areas, and these areas are socially and economically backward in Malaysia. Sabah also scored the slowest economic growth rate compared to the 12 states in ­Malaysia43. Basic infrastructure facilities such as electricity supply, telecommunication network coverage, and roads in the state are still far behind compared to other states in ­Malaysia44. Therefore, it is not surprising that more than half (52%) of students in Sabah face difficulties during the e-learning program throughout the implementation of the national lockdown in 2020. Students in Sabah are commonly faced with a lack of internet access and the ownership of electronic devices (i.e., smartphones,

computers, laptops)45. In turn, the low percentage of electronic device ownership among rural students will indirectly influence their improvement in digital l­iteracy46.
University students with digital literacy and low internet access do not necessarily experience a decline in focus on learning. An anomaly was shown with students in Kuala Lumpur who are more likely to experience a decrease in focus on learning than students in Sabah (Fig. 2a). Besides that, university students in Kuala Lumpur also scored the highest social isolation compared to students in other states in Malaysia (Fig. 4a). At the same time, technical and internet facilities in Kuala Lumpur are considered the most sophisticated among all states in Malaysia (Fig. 3b). This implies that increasing internet access and digital literacy alone will neither boost academic accomplishment (increased learning focus) nor the degree of interaction amongst college students during e-learning. On the other hand, educators (lecturers, teachers, and tutors) should pay special attention to issues involving pedagogical elements that are critical in improving the quality and effectiveness of teaching and learning.
While the government could improve the implementation of e-learning, the improvisation of internet facilities and digital literacy is not enough to address the overall issues with e-learning. As shown in the case of Kuala Lumpur, even though students are equipped with good facilities and internet access, they are still vulnerable to other social issues such as isolation and decreased focus on learning.
Effective teaching strategies attract students to follow e-learning ­programs47. Therefore, in this pandemic era, educators need to be more creative, innovative and provide various teaching techniques to assist the focus and boost the interests of their students in the e-learning program. From a pedagogical point of view, the role of educators (lecturers, teachers, and tutors) should also be taken into account to improve the quality and effectiveness of their teaching. In addition, through the implementation of the e-learning program, the interaction

between teachers and students must also be conducted two-way ­communications48. In other words, the teaching system must shift from the view of the learner as a sponge to the learner as an active construction of m­ eaning49.
Two-way communication may assist in improving the psycho-emotional state as it would allow both individuals to engage o­ penly50. This certainly would generate positive feelings of being validated through an interactive engagement between both individuals. In the context of e-learning, the two-way interaction between students and faculty members, including lecturers is limited. The barriers to two-way communication should be minimized, particularly through student relationships that are often defined through friendship. Social engagements among students themselves would certainly reduce the social isolation that university students in Malaysia commonly face. Educators should thus establish a teaching strategy and a comprehensive module to eliminate impediments to student communication and engagement. This would surely increase the students' interest in e-learning and improve their overall academic performance.
Conclusion and recommendations
This study concluded that geographical location and residential environments impacted students' overall ability and effectiveness to participate in the e-learning program. Students in rural areas are more likely to face technical and connection problems, decreased focus on learning, physical health problems, social isolation, and low digital literacy than the urban students. Despite the distinctive case of students in Kuala Lumpur, the overall result from this study demonstrates that students in rural areas can be considered vulnerable groups facing more risks to various health and social problems as entailed in this study, especially in Sabah, Perlis, and Malacca. Therefore, priority should be given to the most vulnerable groups to ensure these students have the same privileges and opportunities in education as students in urban areas. Findings from this study are critical to inform the relevant policymakers and the government to improve the overall implementation of e-learning in Malaysia. This study provides the nuances of geographical location, especially towards the vulnerable groups, to inform the relevant policymakers and the government to improvise basic infrastructure and facilities so that e-learning can be conveniently accessible to all students in Malaysia. In addition, other pertinent social issues such as mental health and physical health throughout the implementation of e-learning also require an evaluation and intervention from the relevant policymakers to ensure the well-being of students is assured throughout the implementation of e-learning. This study also recommends that teaching professionals (lecturers, teachers, and tutors) who are actively engaged in the e-learning teaching process enhance their pedagogical skills. When e-learning is implemented, effective teaching strategies, in addition to technological factors, connection issues, and poor digital literacy, play a crucial role in enhancing academic achievement and minimizing social isolation among students. Moreover, this study contributes significantly to unveiling the varieties of e-learning challenges based on the intricacies of geo-spatial analysis and mapping which are currently limited in the literature on e-learning during the pandemic Covid-19. The novelty of this study will undoubtedly contribute to the existing literature on understanding the challenges of e-learning for better improvements in the education system in Malaysia.

Abstract
Introduction: The Covid 19 pandemic was first officially noted in China in late 2019. After that, the virus spread globally. At that time it was a new virus and we did know nothing about the virus. So lock down or home confinement was the only option to control the spread of the virus (1). During that time children suffered the most as they were confined at home (2). During this period they showed various behavioural problems and when restrictions were withdrawn they still showed some behavioural issues.
Methodology: We conducted a cross-sectional study using an English questionnaire. The questionnaire was validated by five independent psychiatrists who were finally excluded from the study. Responses from the parents of randomly selected 76 children were recorded. We included the children aged between 3 to 12 years and who previously used to go to school.
Results: 40.8 % of children were of 6 to 10 years of age and the male and females were almost equal in number in our study (M: F = 40:36). Maximum children are from urban residences (about 59.2%) and the nuclear family (56.6%) followed by joint families (38.2%) and single-parent families (5.3%). In most of the cases ( 61.8%) father is the only earning member followed by both parents working (34.2%) and in only 3.9% of cases, the mother is the only earning member of the family. About 76.3% of parents observed behavioural issues in their children. The problems were mostly observed in 6 to 10 yrs of age. Males showed the problem most often than females ( M:F = 33:25). Children from urban areas showed behavioural problems more often.
Discussion: Most of the parents reported that their children were having different sorts of problems during this period(3). The families of small children aged 6 to 10 yrs of age were facing various problems more often. The children of this age group showed problems more often as they were isolated at home. Previously they were in the discipline of school and society. Due to the sudden release of pressure, all routine activities got disturbed.
Keywords: Covid 19, Temper tantrum, restlessness, inattention

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, caused by a new strain of coronavirus(COVID 19) was first officially reported in Wuhan, China in late 2019 (4). Since then it has spread in alarming speed all over the world. WHO declared it a global pandemic in

March 2020 (5). India's first novel coronavirus disease was reported in January 2020 in Kerala (6). Within about 50 days India had reported 360 cases. As it was a new virus and also there was no known effective treatment it was the primary concern to break the chain of virus transmission by confining the people

at home (7). On March 25 nationwide lockdown was imposed by India Government (8).
Since the day of lockdown, the children are confined at home. Before lockdown children could go for a face to face interaction with their peers, teachers, and relatives. They could go outside for playing or for some extracurricular activities. But from the very beginning of lockdown children were confined at home. All the learning and communications became restricted to digital platforms . (9)(10) Children often show emotional and behavioural problems during this period of lockdown.(11)
In this background, we studied a few children to record the degree of changes in this tough time of home confinement.
Materials and Method
We conducted a cross-sectional study using an English questionnaire. India was under unlock period during the study. The questionnaire was validated by five independent psychiatrists who were finally excluded from the study. Before the start of the study, we did a pilot study. The final questionnaire consists of 51 items. The questionnaire was divided into three groups, Socio-demographic data (age, sex, religion, residence, family type, occupation of parents), behavioural changes in children ( inattention, sleep pattern, change of eating habits, depression, anxiety, engagement in mobile, television and internet game, nail-biting, thumb sucking) and parents perception of prolonged home confinement.
Responses from the parents of randomly selected 76 children were recorded. We included the children aged between 3 to 12 years and who previously used to go to school. The children having previous psychiatric problems had been excluded from the study. Before participating in the study written or verbal consent was obtained from the parents. After receiving the consent details of the study were explained. We assured every parent about the confidentiality of responses. The sample consisted of all the residential areas including rural, urban, and metro areas.
Result
40.8 % of children were of 6 to 10 years of age and the male and females were almost equal in number in our study (M: F = 40:36). Maximum children are from urban residences (about 59.2%) and the nuclear family (56.6%) followed by joint families (38.2%) and single-parent families (5.3%). In most of the cases (

61.8%) father is the only earning member followed by both parents working (34.2%) and in only 3.9% of cases, the mother is the only earning member of the family.

We tried to assess the change of behaviour in children during this tough time. They were detached from school, friends and social activities for the last 2 yrs. About 76.3% of parents observed behavioural issues in their children. And the problems are mostly observed in 6 to 10 yrs of age. Males showed the problem most often than females ( M: F = 33:25). Children from urban areas showed behavioural problems more often than in rural areas and metro cities. Children are having problems whose father is the only earning member of the family and where both parents were working.

The following table shows different behavioural problems and their frequencies.51.3% of children demand attention from their family members. 55.3% of children became restless and 46.1% became inattentive in family settings. 53.9% of children got distracted easily. Sleep pattern was more or less normal. A significant number of children (71.1%) increased their mobile use behaviour. 53.9% of children became anxious in different circumstances. 64.5% of children showed temper tantrums and 38.2% of children argued with their family members in various contexts. Watching television and mobile gaming increased more than before. 68.4% of children increased television watching and 59.2% of children increased playing mobile games.

The table above shows different behavioural problems in different age groups. Mainly 6 to 10 yrs old children became inattentive mostly. All the other behavioural problems like temper tantrums increased mobile use and increased watching of television were observed mostly in the 6 to 10 yrs age group.

Inattention, temper tantrum and increased television watching were seen most often in males. But females were using mobiles more often than males.

All the behavioural problems of inattention, temper tantrums, increased mobile use and increased television watching are seen mostly in nuclear families.

Surprisingly the problems are most often seen where the father was working than both parents were working. Inattention, temper tantrums, and increased mobile and television use are seen in families where the father is the only working member.

The above cross-tabulations shows behavioural issues (temper tantrum ) in children who used Mobile phones and watch television more often. Temper tantrums increased in children who spend more time using the screen.

Discussion
We got 76 responses from different regions like metro cities, and urban and rural areas. During the pandemic, children were confined at home and when the pandemic related restrictions were withdrawn, little kids continues to show maladjusted behaviour. In our study, 76.3% of parents reported some behavioural and emotional problems in their children. Previous studies conducted during the early

IJPHRD / Volume 13 Issue 4 / October-December 2022

phases of lockdown show various kinds of emotional and behavioural issues in children. (12)
In our study, we collected the data when strict restrictions were withdrawn. The kids started to go outside, but their emotional issues persisted which is most notable at 6 to 10 yrs of age. Our study matches with a study done on Chinese children which shows significant behavioural issues in a reopened school group. (13)
In our study children from rural areas were affected less often. It is assumed that housing conditions during the isolation phases have a definite impact on children's mental health. When the children have more access to spend time in nature, they are more healthy both physically and mentally. It is supported by one previous study which was conducted during the early phases of quarantine in three different European countries (14).In rural areas people were more reluctant to maintain restrictions. So the children could go outside and could mix and play with their friends.
In our study, we noticed children showed behavioural problems in attention, restlessness, easy distraction, sleep disturbances, fearfulness, anxiety, aggression, disobedience, temper tantrum, nail-biting and increased television and mobile phone use. The previous studies also showed similar findings in behavioural issues . (15) During the isolation phases when kids were detached from their friends, relatives found the only way of pleasure is watching TV or mobile phone use. In some families, domestic violence increased during the isolation phases which changed the children's behaviour (16).
Temper tantrums increased in children who watched mobile and television more often and in nuclear families. Few previous studies also show similar findings where there was a positive correlation between screen time and behavioural and emotional symptoms (17) . During the time of home confinement, children had less chance to ventilate emotions. Their pent up emotions were channelized into unacceptable emotional expressions.
Conclusion
We studied behavioural problems during the early phases of school opening after about 2 yrs of home confinement during Covid 19 pandemic. Most of the parents reported that their children were having different sorts of behavioural problems during this

period. The families of small children aged 6 to 10 yrs of age were facing various problems more often than children younger and older than this age group. The children of this age group showed problems more often as they were being isolated at home when they started to socialize and were in the discipline of school and society. Due to the sudden release of pressure of discipline all routine activities got disturbed. They spent most of their time watching television and different activities on mobile phones.
Most behavioural issues occurred in nuclear families where children got less chance to play with the family members who also got emotionally disturbed by the uncertainty of future, health and economy. The small kids with pent up emotional stress often behaved in a way that was not acceptable to their families.
A significant number of children (53.9%) became anxious in various family and social circumstances. During the pandemic, children spent most of their time with their families. They did not have a chance to socialize or attend the social gathering which ultimately provoked anxiety in the environment which is not very familiar to them.

pathways for children, young people and families . To identify the barriers to better patient care within the
paediatric department . To facilitate shared learning
Methods In June 2020, to capture the rapid changes in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the quality improvement `Change Wall' initiative was used. Core teams and individuals in the paediatric department at Musgrove Park Hospital were asked five questions regarding changes to the department based on plan, do, study, act (PDSA) cycles. Responses were collated and shared via a wall display to disseminate key learning points. Results We had responses from 13 teams within the paediatric department. Results showed respondents were broadly aiming to address three aspects of care in response to the coronavirus pandemic: ensuring appropriate and timely paediatric support for the acute services; striving to continue to maintain high quality communication with patients and their families; and to alter the physical environment in order to reduce the potential transmission of COVID-19.
Data captured showed multiple initiatives have been introduced. A key development was the introduction of a second paediatric high dependency area. An outpatient department working party was established and the waiting lists for new patients reduced from six months to two weeks. With paediatric oncology patients no longer able to ring the bell to celebrate the end of their treatment, a `party in a box' was introduced.
To be able to provide greater out-of-hours support, the children and young people's mental health team and diabetes nursing team flexed their patterns of working.
Colleagues in the children's eating disorder service have changed their working too, which has helped to prevent long inpatient admissions. In one innovative case, they offered nasogastric tube feeding top ups at home, supported by the children's community nursing team, and prevented a child from being admitted to the most specialist care for four to six months. Conclusions Overall, many of the changes have been felt to be positive and are being evaluated to continue long term because of the perceived benefit to patient care and the potential to ease winter pressures. We plan to continue to use the change wall to capture changes made within paediatrics beyond coronavirus. This will allow us to continue to disseminate knowledge of changes happening and inspire further change. We plan to re-visit each team in the next six months to explore which improvements have been sustained or adapted. Moving forward we also aim to capture the view of the patient and parent/carer with regards to their perceptions of changes made.

CLINICAL FEATURES AND OUTCOMES OF NEONATAL

COVID-19: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

10.1136/bmjpo-2021-RCPCH.216

Background In general, children with COVID-19 have milder illness and better prognosis compared to adults.

A114

However, the neonatal population (from birth to 28 days of life) may be more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 disease due to the immaturity of neonatal immune system and possibility of in-utero infection from infected mothers. Comprehensive data on neonatal COVID-19 manifestations is currently lacking. Objectives We aimed to determine the clinical manifestations and outcomes of neonates with COVID-19, and characterise these clinical characteristics based on illness severity. Methods A systematic review (CRD42020183500) was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines with Embase, PubMed, and China Knowledge Resource Integrated (CNKI) databases until 1 August 2020. Additional studies were identified from references of included studies and the John Hopkins Centre for Humanitarian Health database. Studies reporting neonates (£ 28 days old) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) were included. Descriptive statistics were used to compare mildmoderately ill neonates (non-severe group) with severelycritically ill neonates (severe group). This grouping was based on the World Health Organization's definition. Continuous variables were analysed using Wilcoxon-Rank Sum Test. Dichotomous or categorical data were analysed with Chi-square and Fisher's Exact Tests. Quality of the studies were reviewed with Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Murad Tool. Results Sixty-seven studies were included out of 199 full text articles screened. Studies comprised of case reports, case series or cohort studies. Of ninety-nine neonates with COVID-19 infection, 72 (72.7%) were symptomatic. Amongst the symptomatic neonates, respiratory symptoms were common: shortness of breath (36.1%), nasal symptoms (19.4%), cough (18.1%). Other symptoms included fever (55.6%), feeding problems (31.9%) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (16.7%). Lymphopenia was present in 43.9% (18 of 41 neonates tested). Elevated C-reactive protein was only reported in 13.2% (5 of 38 neonates tested), while 65.4% (34 of 52 neonates) had chest radiographs suggestive of pneumonia. Thirty neonates (30.3%) had severe-critical illness (severe group), while 69 (69.9%) had mild-moderate illness (non-severe group). Compared with the non-severe group, more neonates in the severe group were symptomatic (100% vs 60.9%, p<0.001), had dyspnoea (66.7% vs 14.3%, p<0.001) and abnormal chest radiographic findings (84.6% vs 61.5%, p=0.038). Accordingly, more neonates in the severe group were admitted to the intensive care unit (91.7% vs 41.7%, p<0.001). On the contrary, mild-moderately ill neonates had increased incidence of fever (69.0% vs 36.7%, p=0.006), and GI symptoms (26.2% vs 3.33%, p=0.01). Ten out of 11 of mild-moderately ill neonates displaying GI symptoms did not have dyspnoea. Laboratory findings, duration of hospital stay, birth characteristics and age at COVID-19 diagnoses were similar between these two groups. No mortalities were reported. Conclusions Prognosis of COVID-19 neonates were favourable. We postulate that GI symptoms alone predict a better prognosis, while GI symptoms with dyspnoea predict a worse prognosis, as observed in adults. However, our studies were of moderate quality, and clinical findings and investigation results were not completely reported. As the pandemic evolves, prospective studies and more systematic reporting of cases will improve our understanding of neonatal COVID-19 and verify utility of symptoms and laboratory tests in predicting the severity of disease.

Abstract
The novel coronavirus COVID-19 was initially found in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then, the COVID-19 virus has rapidly spread throughout the world, causing the collapse of medical systems and economic depression. In addition to providing various relief programs, many countries have implemented various anti-epidemic measures to stop the continuous deterioration of the epidemic and maintain the stability of their economies. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency decision making and risk assessment is an important issue for guaranteeing the stable life of the people are considered emergency multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problems. The assessment information of the criteria simultaneously includes complete, incomplete and hesitant fuzzy linguistic information in emergency MCDM problems. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach can effectively process MCDM problems; however, the traditional AHP approach cannot handle the incomplete and hesitant fuzzy linguistic information of emergency MCDM problems. In order to overcome these issues, this paper proposed a novel flexible AHP method to solve emergency MCDM problems under the COVID-19 pandemic, and adopted a numerical case about public health emergency decision making and risk assessment under the COVID-19 pandemic to verify the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed flexible AHP method.
1 Introduction
Since late December 2019, when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered, the COVID-19 coronavirus has rapidly spread throughout the world. On January 10, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined the new coronavirus as COVID-19, with `CO' meaning corona, `VI' meaning virus, `D' meaning disease, and `19' meaning the year it was discovered (Chen et al. 2021). The COVID-19 coronavirus spreads among people with frightening speed, posing a serious threat to life and causing a global pandemic (Hong et al. 2020). As of September 2021, 230 million people worldwide have been infected with COVID-19, and 4.77 million of them have died (WHO publication, 2021). In order to effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19, many scholars in various fields have conducted analysis and research on the epidemic situations related to COVID-19. For example, Chen et al. (2020) used news reports of COVID-19 as a simulation example and applied big textual data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the machine optimization process. The improved data analysis of Chen et al.'s (2020) method can remove functional and meaningless words quickly through machine processing and provide corpus data for decision makers in specific fields for further use. Wang et al. (2021) used the AHP method, brainstorming and literature research to establish a risk evaluation model for COVID-19 infection and provide management strategies to reduce COVID-19 infections. COVID-19 is no longer limited to medical issues, and various fields have taken great efforts to handle issues that are related to COVID-19, such as emergency logistics systems, supply chain risk management, travel, and tourism industry issues, medical issues, waste management, and so on (e.g., Baryannis et al. 2019; Bazan et al. 2021; Jiang et al. 2020; Skare et al. 2021; Van Fan et al. 2021). With the COVID-19 pandemic expanding rapidly while medical resources are limited and scattered across the country, how to collect opinions and suggestions from experts from
Page 2/25

various fields, as well as effectively integrate, allocate, and utilize existing medical resources, are truly complex and difficult issues which can be categorized as emergency multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problems. On the other hand, due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, the collection of emergency data is an enormous challenge due to the lack of sufficient information about the disease and statistics on the number of infected people and medical resources, etc. There are many unknown, partially known, missing, or non-existent data in the process of collecting information, which leads to increased uncertainty and complexity in emergency support decision-making.
Saaty (1980) developed a mathematical tool composed of a hierarchical structure called the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, which based on the judgment of knowledgeable experts to conduct pairwise comparison for each criterion, rank criteria and evaluate alternatives from the total weighted score to obtain the solution characteristics of multi-level and hierarchical structures and to systematically solve problems that contain qualitative and quantitative elements. The AHP method is considered an effective approach for handling complex decisions and can help decision makers prioritize various attributes and make correct decisions. For example, Das et al. (2021) combined the decision-making experiment and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and AHP methods to evaluate the factors affecting supply chain networks under the environment of COVID-19. The results showed that the most important element is the optimization of cost. This research finding could help policy makers improve their operational capabilities and performance by developing a risk-resilient supply chain framework, as well as effectively eliminate the problems plaguing the supply chain during the epidemic. Hussain et al. (2021) used the AHP method to deal with group decision-making problems during the COVID-19 pandemic and emphasized energy management performance as a critical issue. The results showed that government measures and personal factors are the biggest influencing factors. The survey results also provided insights for government agencies as a reference for prioritizing workforce health and safety. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ortiz-Barrios et al. (2021) combined the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and AHP methods to improve the preparation level of sales departments and applied it to the electrical appliance sector. The results showed that this is a flexible methodology that can identify weaknesses that should be resolved to improve effectiveness under current market conditions. The AHP method has also been used extensively in other applications, such as driver safety (Moslem et al. 2020), group decision making (Lin et al. 2020), risk management (Lyu et al. 2020), supplier selection (Chang et al. 2016), and so on.
In general, decision makers may not have sufficient confidence in their preferences, leading to an increased degree of uncertainty associated with their decisions. People also often make many ambiguous answers due to incomplete information. In order to represent uncertain evaluation information clearly, Zadeh (1965) presented the fuzzy set theory to solve these situations. However, human cognition not only has fuzzy uncertainty but may also contain hesitation uncertainty. Rodriguez et al. (2012) proposed the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS), which uses different terms to estimate a linguistic variable instead of a single term to solve the hesitant information of experts. Later, Liao et al. (2015) redefined HFLTS in mathematics and introduced elements of hesitation and fuzzy linguistic. In addition, numerous other researchers have used HFLTS to deal with MCDM problems. For example,
Page 3/25

Samanlioglu and Kaya (2020) used country-level intervention strategies for COVID-19 to make pairwise comparisons using the hesitant fuzzy AHP method, determine the relative importance scores between intervention strategies, and assess the importance of alternative intervention strategies. The result showed that their method can provide flexibility in decision making for decision makers (policymakers, governors, and physicians). Sir and Sir (2021) combined the Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method and the hesitant AHP method to determine the ranking of various alternatives for the treatment of pain, so as to select the best alternative to alleviate the pain of COVID-19 patients. According to the results, paracetamol and interventional therapy are the first two preferred treatment options, which implied that high accurate methods are used to eliminate errors that caused by experts' subjective evaluation during the pain treatment process. HFLTS can deal with hesitant linguistic information effectively; therefore, it has been applied in various researches by many scholars, such as supplier selection (Chang 2015), strategic management (Liao et al. 2020), investments (Liao et al. 2019), and so on.
To carry out uncertainties or nonexistent information that traditional method can not to handle, Molodtsov (1999) initialed the soft set, which was a new concept of generic mathematical tool that could be used to deal with undefined or uncertain objects and reduce bias in the process of solving decisionmaking problems. Today, it can be seen that this mathematical model continues to be developed with each passing day, and it has been successfully applied to several areas, such as operational research, game theory, and probability (Baskaran and Eswari 2021). In addition, many researchers have used soft sets to deal with different decision-making problems, such as supplier selection (Chang 2015), cloud datacenter selection strategies (Baskaran and Eswari 2021), decision making (Dalkilic 2021), COVID-19 vaccine preferences (Narayanamoorthy et al. 2021), and other various fields.
Recently, Ashraf and Abdullah (2020) proposed the AHP method to handle the public health emergency decision making (PHEDM) of COVID-19. However, their method cannot deal with the incomplete and hesitant information provided by experts. In order to solve the above problem, this study developed a novel technique that integrated HFTLS, the soft set, and the AHP method to not only handle hesitant information but also handle nonexistent information under the COVID-19 environment.
The remainder of this study is organized as follows. In Section 2, this study reviews COVID-19 and related works on the AHP method, soft sets, and HFTLS. Section 3 proposes a flexible AHP method that integrates the AHP method, soft sets, and HFTLS to deal with emergency decision-making issues about COVID-19 under an incomplete information environment. Section 4 applies an illustrative example of the PHEDM for COVID-19 to demonstrate its effectiveness. Finally, this study represents conclusions and future works in section 5.
2 Literature Review
This section introduces an overview of COVID-19 and presents some basic concepts and procedures related to the AHP method, HFLTS, and soft sets.

2.1 COVID-19
Since the novel coronavirus COVID-19 was first found in Wuhan, China in 2019, it has caused severe economic losses worldwide, endangered people's lives, caused social disorder, and affected people's living standards seriously. There are many claims about the origin of COVID-19, including that it was caused by the consumption of wild animals. When investigating the initial COVID-19 infectious disease case, scientists discovered that many patients had been to a wholesale seafood market in Huanan, where many carcasses of wild animals were sold (Singhal 2020; Yuan et al. 2020). Furthermore, experts believe that the Wuhan biosafety level 4 laboratory did not take protective measures during the experiment, which caused the virus to leak.
COVID-19 symptoms include fever, cough, physical fatigue, dyspnea, and soreness. Compared with SARSCoV in 2002, the similarity of its gene structure is more than 70% (Lu et al. 2020, Sun et al. 2020). At present, the number of patients infected with COVID-19 is still continuously increasing. Based on the above situation, the novel coronavirus is severely and continuously affecting global political and economic systems. Many countries hope to control the COVID-19 epidemic effectively by adopting the method of blocking cities and closing borders, resulting in the cancellation of a large number of flights and travel itineraries and having a huge impact on aviation, transportation, tourism, and other industries. Most countries have banned public gatherings, suspended classes (moving to at-home classes or online learning), prohibiting eating out, forced people to wear masks, and required companies to allow their employees to work at home to reduce gatherings. This has caused a change in lifestyle and increased the use of cloud operations. Many companies have also stopped production lines while for the epidemic to ease. Therefore, COVID-19 is considered to be the greatest crisis facing humanity since World War II (Lippi et al. 2020).
Over the past year, due to the successful development of vaccines, the situation in various countries has gradually stabilized. However, as the virus have mutated to the Alpha, Beta, and Delta virus, in addition to causing a large number of deaths in India, the number of people infected with the epidemic in Europe and the United States has risen again, and countries around the world are still struggling with the virus.
2.2 AHP method
In 1980, Saaty developed the AHP method, which decomposes complex MCDM problems into a hierarchical structure with criteria and alternatives and uses the pairwise comparison of factors to solve multi-dimensional MCDM problems. The AHP method can consider both qualitative and quantitative aspects, define unstructured issues, and clearly state goals and results. It is considered a powerful and flexible tool for solving complex MCDM problems that can help decision makers to make accurate decisions. The basic procedure of the AHP method for solving MCDM problems is as follows (Lee 2009):
Step 1: Identify critical factors and subfactors through a hierarchal structure
Page 5/25

It deconstructs a problem through a hierarchical relationship from high to low, and then systematically determines the level, structure, and quantification of the problem.

Step 2: Make a pairwise comparison between the identified factors based on a scale of 1-9

The rating scale (Table 1) is used to perform pairwise comparisons between the identified factors.

Step 3: Calculate the consistency ratio (CR)

The consistency ratio (CR) and consistency index (CI) are used to check the consistency of the expert assessment opinions, as shown in Eq. (2) and Eq. (3).

where max is the maximum eigenvector of the pairwise comparison matrix A, and n is the size of the pairwise matrix. The random index (RI) value is based on the different matrix sizes, as shown in Table 2.

Step 4: Rank factors based on their optimal weight calculation

The calculation results in step 3 are used to obtain the weight of each evaluation attribute, then, the relative weights of the evaluation attributes are aggregated to get the total rating of the alternatives.
2.3 HFLTS
Rodriguez et al. (2012) first proposed the concept of HFLTS, which can process ambiguous conditions. The basic properties and operations of HFLTS are described below.

Definition 1

(Rodriguez et al. 2012): Let S = be a linguistic term set (LTS) and be an HELTS. is an ordered finite subset of the continuous language terms of S. For example, if S = is an LTS, then is an LTS of S.

Definition 2

(Rodriguez et al. 2012): Let S = be an LTS and be an arbitrary HFLTS of S. The lower and upper bounds of the HFLTS are defined as follows:

Hs- = min (si ) = sj , sj  Hs and si  sj , i. (4)

, and (5) Hs+ = max (si ) = sj sj  Hs

si  sj , i.

Definition 3

(Rodriguez et al. 2012): The envelope of an HFLTS, env, is a linguistic interval between the lower and upper bounds :

env (Hs)=[Hs- , Hs+ ]. (6)
2.4 Soft set
Molodtsov (1999) proposed the concept of soft sets as a mathematical approach for handling uncertainties that traditional methods cannot handle, and defined the principles of soft sets in the following way:

Definition 4

(Molodtsov 1999): Assume that the pair (F, A) is a soft set over U, where F is a mapping given by:

F : A  P (U )
7 In other words, the soft set U is a family of parameterized subsets of the universe U. For   A, F () may be considered as the set of -approximate elements of the soft set (F, A).
Page 7/25

Definition 5
(Maji et al. 2003; Ali et al. 2009): Let (F, A) and (G, B) be two soft sets on the common universal set U. The intersection set of (F, A) and (G, B) is represented by (H, C), which should meet the following conditions:

C = AB
e  C, H (e) = F (e) orG (e) (as both are the same set)
Definition 6 (Maji et al. 2003; Ali et al. 2009): Let (F, A) and (G, B) be two soft sets on the common universal set U. If (F, A) and (G, B) meet the conditions below, then (F, A) is a subset of (G, B), denoted as :

AB

e  A, F (e)  G (e)
Definition 7
(Maji et al. 2003; Ali et al. 2009): Let (F, A) and (G, B) be two soft sets on the common universal set U. The union set of (F, A) and (G, B) is represented by (H, C), which should meet the following conditions:
1. (i)C = A  B 2. (ii)e  C



F (e) ife  A - B



H (e) = 

G (e) ife  B - A

  F (e)  G (e) ife  A  B

3 The Proposed Approach
3.1 The planning of proposed method
COVID-19 broke out at the end of 2019, raged across the world in 2020 and 2021, and continues to cause a large number of casualties and serious economic problems in various countries. It has caused nearly five million deaths worldwide. The economies of all countries have been severely tested, and most countries are still at the stage of fighting the virus. When a major emergency occurs in a country, although the government can invite experts from various fields to hold discussions within a short time period, due to the different backgrounds and expertise of the experts, they may not be able to clearly express the assessment information; moreover, the process of data collection often contains large amounts of qualitative and quantitative information. Emergency situations are characterized by limited time, limited

Page 8/25

information, and uncertainty. Therefore, PHEDM is considered a complex MCDM problem. The AHP method can adopt a hierarchical structure and consider qualitative and quantitative information, and can effectively handle complex decision-making problems.
Fundamentally speaking, the information of emergencies is incomplete and uncertain. Experts are severely bound by such uncertainty, yet they must respond immediately and provide emergency solutions to effectively control the situation. At the beginning of the outbreak, there was insufficient data on the variants, which caused results in clinical trials and other medical technologies remaining in the critical stage of exploration, moreover, these responses given by experts in the emergency decision may be include hesitant, and incomplete information, which made the traditional AHP method cannot be completely solved. In order to adapt appropriate and accurate measures to respond to emergency decision-making situations and solve the aforementioned issue, this paper integrated the typical AHP method, the soft set approach, and HFLTS to deal with a numerical case about PHEDM. The results demonstrated the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method, showed that it would not lose any professional knowledge in providing useful information, and revealed that it could better reflect the practical feasibility of emergency decision making in the real world.
3.2 The procedure of the proposed method
The basic procedure for implementing the proposed method consists of the following steps:
Step 1. Organize an emergency decision making committee
Recruit experts and scholars in various fields related to emergency decision making and form a committee to hold discussions, determine decision-making problems, and seek solutions.
Step 2. Construct and determine emergency decision-making evaluation criteria
Define criteria or important influence factors related to decision-making as a key consideration in developing appropriate and accurate measures for analyzing and judging solutions, and ask experts to score each evaluation criterion.
Step 3. Defuzzify the hesitant fuzzy information
Use Eqs. (4) to (6) to deal with evaluation criteria scores containing hesitant fuzzy linguistic information, and calculations that use the arithmetic mean to defuzzify hesitant fuzzy information.
Step 4. Fill in incomplete information
Use the soft set concept to handle evaluation criteria scores containing incomplete or nonexistent information, and average the known information, then to supplement in incomplete information.
Step 5. Calculate the relative weights of the criteria
Page 9/25

Use Eqs. (1) to (3) to calculate the pairwise comparison matrix, and then obtain the relative weights of each criterion. Step 6. Calculate the aggregated value of the emergency decision making and rank the alternative solutions Once the relative weights of the criteria are confirmed in step 5, calculate the relative weights and the alternatives to gain the aggregate value of the PHEDM. Then, use the results to rank the alternatives and select the best alternative solution. Step 7. Provide suggestions from the project team According to the result of ranking the PHEDM, execute the most suitable plan, evaluate the effectiveness of the decision making, and review the implementation results.
4 Case Study
4.1 Overview
During the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency decision making and risk assessment have become important issues for guaranteeing the stable life of the people. However, the decision-making process often contains qualitative and quantitative information, as well as limited time. The assessment information of the criteria simultaneously includes complete, incomplete and hesitant fuzzy linguistic information, so it is regarded as an emergency MCDM problem. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, this section gives an illustrative case of the PHEDM for COVID-19 (adapted from Ashraf and Abdullah 2020). The case of public health emergency decision making for COVID-19 was composed of seven criteria and five alternatives. The basic criteria included clinical management (CM), first-aid training (FT), technician training (TT), banning intra-city transportation (BT), global uncertainty (GU), country-level coordination and planning (CP), and monitoring (MO), as shown in Table 3. The five alternatives included risk communication (A1), blocking borders and cities (A2), medical system (A3), research needs (A4), and asking the experts (A5). The consultant committee was comprised of five experts who provided scores for the preventive emergency criteria of COVID-19, as shown in Table 4. The importance scores of the seven evaluation criteria for the five alternatives are shown in Table 5.

Table 3 Preventive emergency criteria of COVID-19

Vaccination is a massively effective preventive method for reducing COVID-19 in many countries. It is rarely seen to have severe side effects, and it is an effective disease prevention and control measure.
Due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, representatives need to undergo relevant first aid training.
The rapid sharing of viral genetic information among countries in the world will help countries develop potential vaccines.
To prevent the virus from spreading and to protect the safety of the people, the government has taken measures to ban flights, cancel various celebrations, and maintain social distancing between people.
COVID-19 has changed people's lifestyles, affected the transportation and tourism industries, caused factory closures, delayed deliveries, and harmed international trade and economic development.
The government needs to work closely with all local administrative agencies to deal with the uncertainty of COVID-19.
Government public health experts should continuously monitor the state of COVID-19 and provide suggestions to improve the situation.

4.2 Application of the typical AHP method

The AHP method has the advantages of providing solutions with a multi-level and hierarchical structure, and it can systematically solve problems that contain both qualitative and quantitative elements, making it an effective tool for handling complex decisions. During information processing, the AHP method can only deal with complete information. According to Table 4, Experts 2 and 3 provided partially hesitant information, and Expert 4 provided partially incomplete information. However, the typical AHP method could only deal with complete information about the evaluation criteria for the emergency public health decisions given by the experts. Thus, only Experts 1 and 5 provided complete information that could be used to calculate the criteria weight, whereas, the information from the Expert 2-4 should be eliminated. The solution procedure was as follows:

Page 13/25

Step 1. Calculate the criteria weights

Experts 2, 3, and 4 lacked professional knowledge of the criteria and could not give them appropriate ratings. As these limitations would lead to an invalid questionnaire, only the rating results of Experts 1 and 5 could be used to perform arithmetic average calculations for the calculation weights.

The pairwise comparison matrix shown in Table 4 was used to calculate the weight of each standard. First, the AHP method was used to calculate the arithmetic mean from Expert 1 and 5's given scores, and then the weight calculation was implemented. The CR value was calculated to examine the consistency of the test and ensure that the judgements of the decision makers were consistent. When the CR value < 0.1 the judgements were acceptable. Eqs. (1) to (3) were used to calculate the , max CI, and CR values, as shown below:

After multiplying the weight values of the seven evaluation criteria with the scores shown in Table 6, the weighted scores of five alternatives were obtained, as shown in Table 7. In the ranking of the alternatives, from highest to lowest, A1 was the best alternative with a score of 0.788, followed by the weights of A3, A2, A4, and A5 at 0.720, 0.708, 0.579, and 0.560, respectively.

4.3 Application of the hesitant AHP method

In real life, people often provide ambiguous answers to problems due to incomplete information, and they can be severely bound by uncertainty and risk. When encountering harmful and uncertain situations, the typical AHP method can only deal with complete information. In this study, regarding the preventive emergency criteria given by the experts, as shown in Table 4, the typical AHP method would delete the partially hesitant information provided by Experts 2 and 3, causing some important information to be dismissed. However, the hesitant AHP method proposes a concept that uses a set of possible linguistic terms to represent the hesitation of the experts and uses different terms to estimate a linguistic variable instead of using single terms to solve hesitant information, and therefore it can effectively deal with the shortcomings of the typical AHP method. The solution procedure is shown as follows:

Step 1. Defuzzify the hesitant fuzzy information

According to Table 4, Expert 3 have a score to MO in CM is 4-5 which represented hesitant fuzzy information. This study used Eq. (6) and the arithmetic mean to defuzzify the hesitant fuzzy information. The average number was calculated to be 4.5 and was used in the next calculations. Other hesitant values are also used with the same method to obtain the exact value.

Step 2. Determine the evaluation criteria weight

After defuzzifying the hesitant fuzzy information, based on Table 4, Eqs. (1) to (3) were used to calculate max=7.603 and then calculate the CI value. The calculation results showed that the CR value was 0.077, which met the consistency standard (CR <0.1). The priority vector results showed that TT had the most important weight value at 0.297, followed by the weights of CP, CM, FT, GU, BT, and MO at 0.275, 0.159, 0.149, 0.044, 0.040, and 0.036, respectively.

Step 3. Confirm the rankings of the criteria and alternatives

After multiplying the weight values of the seven evaluation criteria with the scores in Table 8, the weighted scores of the five alternatives could be obtained, as shown in Table 9. In the ranking of the alternatives, from highest to lowest, A1 was the best alternative with a score of 0.793, followed by the weights of A2, A3, A5, and A4 at 0.721, 0.709, 0.573, and 0.572, respectively.

4.4 Application of the proposed method

In cases of emergencies or disasters, it is often necessary to carry out major disaster relief operations, and decision-making teams often have to be established. This requires the input of relevant experts from different backgrounds and various fields. When an emergency occurs, effective rescue methods must be provided to control and respond the emergency immediately. When asked to make a decision, experts in

Page 16/25

different fields may be unable to make quick and correct judgments or provide advice under unfamiliar situations, which usually results in nonexistent information. The traditional procedure of data collection will delete any incomplete information, which may result in biased assessment results. In order to overcome these issues, this study extended the AHP method and combined HFLTS and the soft set to solve PHEDM problems. The following steps describe the procedure:

Steps 1 and 2. Organize an emergency decision-making committee to construct and determine the emergency decision-making evaluation criteria

Gather domestic experts in various fields to form a decision-making team to respond to the epidemic, establish a structure for decision making, and define criteria or important influencing factors relevant to the decision-making as a key consideration for analyzing and judging the solutions, and ask the experts to give a score for each evaluation criteria.

Step 3. Defuzzify the hesitant fuzzy information

As shown in Table 4, Experts 2, 3, and 5 partially lacked professional knowledge of the criteria and could give them appropriate. In order to deal with the hesitant fuzzy information, the solution procedure was also completed in reference to section 4.3. According to that shown in Table 3, Expert 3 gave a score to GU in FT is 5-6, which represented hesitant fuzzy information. This study used Eq. 6 and the arithmetic mean to defuzzify the hesitant fuzzy information. The average number was calculated to 5.5 and used for further computations. The same method was then used for other information containing hesitant values to obtain the exact value.

Step 4. Fill in incomplete information

After completing the hesitant fuzzy information computation, based on Table 4, Expert 4 could not give a score to CP in CM, perhaps Expert 4 doesn't understand the criteria mean, so the incomplete or nonexistent information has to be deleted directly in traditional data collection approach, which will lose some important information for other criteria. To overcome the challenge of incomplete or nonexistent information, this study used Eqs. (7) and (8) from section 2.3 to average the other known information and then fill in the incomplete information. The same way was used with other incomplete values to obtain the determined value and then proceed to the subsequent calculation process.

Step 5. Determine the evaluation criteria weight

The solution procedure was also completed in reference to section 4.2, after steps 3 and 4, according to Table 4, employs Eqs. (1), (2), and (3) to calculate max=7.574 and then shows the calculation for the CI value. The calculation results showed that the CR value was 0.073, which met the consistency standard (CR <0.1).

After confirming the consistency of the information provided by the experts, different weight values for the weight calculations were assigned according to their degree of importance. As shown in Table 10, the priority vector results showed that TT had the most important weight value at 0.299, followed by the weights of CP, CM, FT, GU, BT, and MO at 0.275, 0.158, 0.151, 0.042, 0.040, and 0.035, respectively.

Step 6. Calculate the aggregated value of the emergency decision making and rank the alternative solutions

After finishing the weight calculations of the criteria, the results of the scores of 7 evaluation preventive emergency criteria from step 5 will multiply with 5 alternatives that are obtained in Table 11, then rank the computation result for PHEDM. In the ranking of alternatives, from highest to lowest, A1 was found to be the best alternative with a score of 0.796, followed by the weights of A2, A3, A4, and A5 at 0.720, 0.710, 0.575, and 0.573, respectively.

Step 7. Provide project team with suggestions

The results of the PHEDM ranking were used to provide the most suitable alternative anti-epidemic policy. The implementation results of the most suitable alternative were continuously reviewed to evaluate the effectiveness of the decision and confirm the problem had been solved effectively to achieve the expected goal.

The typical AHP method can only handle exact information, moreover, the hesitant AHP method addressed only hesitant fuzzy information. If the experts provided information containing partially nonexistent information, the typical AHP method and hesitant AHP method would dismiss some available information, causing bias in the decision procedure. The proposed method was verified by numerical examples and found to be useful when encounter information containing unknown, partially known, missing, or non-existent information during the collection of COVID-19 data. The advantages of the proposed method are presented below.
First, when collecting information to solve group MCDM problems, experts in various fields such as economics, medicine, and public health may be unfamiliar or unaware of certain professional knowledge and be unable to answer certain questions, causing certain information to be unavailable. Traditionally, due to research method limitations, the typical AHP method and hesitant AHP method have been unable to handle partially nonexistent information; therefore, the typical AHP method and hesitant AHP method will often neglect important information. In order to deal with incomplete information, this study used the concept of the soft set to deal with this situation and retain crucial questionnaire information. The proposed method could calculate all possible selection values for each object and supplement missing information by means of numerical averaging to overcome the aforementioned problem of partially nonexistent information. Therefore, all the questionnaire information could be presented authentically, considered fully, and applied widely.
Second, in practice, the typical AHP method can only handle exact values; when encountering hesitant fuzzy information, the available information will be ambiguous. Therefore, questionnaires containing hesitant fuzzy information will be considered invalid and deleted, causing valuable information to go missing and easily resulting in biased assessment results. The hesitant AHP method and the proposed flexible AHP method can deal with hesitant fuzzy information by applying a defuzzification method to determine the interval value of the evaluation data set and replacing this information with the mean value. According to Table 13, after considering the hesitant fuzzy information, the A2 and A3 for ranking
Page 20/25

of alternative is2nd and3rd in the hesitant AHP method and proposed flexible AHP method, different from the typical AHP method with 3rd and 2nd, in addition, the result of typical AHP method may have significant errors in emergency medical resource allocation.

Third, based on Table 4, it contained hesitant fuzzy information (Expert 3 and 4) and partially nonexistent information (Expert 5). Due to the hesitant AHP method being unable to handle partially nonexistent information, as shown in Table 13, the calculation result of the hesitant AHP method indicated that A4 (0.572) was ranked fifth and that A5 (0.573) was ranked fourth. The closeness of these values could cause errors in ranking. However, because of the proposed flexible AHP method being able to deal with unknown, partly-known, missing, inexistent, or hesitant fuzzy linguistic data, it could fully consider the available information and distinguish small numerical differences. The calculation result showed that A4 (0.576) was ranked fourth and A5 (0.574) was ranked fifth, which was the correct ranking. This result showed that the proposed method could allow decision makers to fully consider the available information.

5 Conclusion And Future Works
The outbreak and rapid spread of COVID-19 since December 2019 have severely affected the world's economic development and people's lives and survival. From the past experience of epidemic prevention in various countries, it can be understood that if correct epidemic prevention measures and medical planning are adopted in the early stage of an epidemic, the severity of the epidemic can be greatly reduced. How to properly allocate medical resources is a crucial issue for emergency MCDM problems related to COVID-19. Emergency MCDM problems involve many levels and factors and usually contain both qualitative and quantitative information and factors. Moreover, when giving assessment criteria scores for emergency MCDM problems, the experts may encounter problems due to time constraints or insufficient information, including incomplete and hesitant fuzzy information. These conditions will make it difficult for group decision makers to make correct decisions. In order to deal with the above situation, this study extended the AHP method to propose a flexible AHP method that was proved through a numerical analysis of PHEDM. It did not lose any expertise in providing important and useful information,
Page 21/25

and it could overcome the challenges of emergency MCDM problems under uncertain and ambiguous environments. The advantages of the flexible AHP method are summarized as follows: (1) The proposed flexible AHP method can deal with partially nonexistent information in PHEDM for COVID-19. (2) The proposed flexible AHP method can address hesitant fuzzy linguistic information in PHEDM for COVID-19. (3) The proposed flexible AHP method can fully consider the available information. (4) The traditional AHP method (Ashraf and Abdullah 2020) is a special case of the proposed flexible AHP method. Due to the traditional AHP method usually supposed to be independent during criteria assessment, in the future, this article may be able to study in the direction of the correlation among criteria, and preferable to reflect the practical feasibility in the real world.

SUMMARY - Chronic wounds are often underestimated condition with increasingly growing inpatient and outpatient treatment costs. Since the patient population affected by chronic wounds is heterogeneous and includes diabetes, chronic venous insufficiency and peripheral artery disease patients, with additional differences in gender, age, previous medical history, treatment of chronic wounds is highly personalized and dependent on a variety of factors. This paper aims to highlight the problems that the chronic wound patient population is facing during the COVID-19 pandemic: from higher probability of an undesirable disease outcome to the fact that many of them have limited access to primary care providers and to the regular and continuous care that their condition demands.
This paper describe three patients with chronic wounds. Each of the patients had a significant worsening of their chronic wounds during the COVID-19 pandemic: either following an active SARS-CoV-2 infection or due to the limited access to primary care.
The cases described here highlight the necessity of providing proper and regular care for all patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of the current state of the healthcare system and the adversities and hurdles it currently faces, to prevent the pandemic from becoming a syndemic.
Keywords: chronic wounds, care, COVID-19 pandemic

Introduction
Chronic wounds are an often underestimated issue, even though there is data showing that they negatively impact the quality of life of 2.5% of the total US population and present a significant economic burden on the healthcare system.1 With the advent of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, patients with chronic wounds are at an even greater risk, with the risk factors related to chronic wounds (hypertension, vascular disorders, diabetes) being some of the most important predictors of severe presentations and lethal outcomes of COVID-19. Having all the listed factors in mind, it is easy to see why proper, regular and time-

ly chronic wound care is a priority. Adding to that point is the fact that the lack of regular visits to a wound care clinic can increase hospitalization rates by up to 20 times.2 In this case series, we present three patients unfortunately affected by a combination of the sequelae of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, lack of regular visits to a wound care clinic and an ineffective bureaucracy, the sum of which presents itself as serious infections with single or multi-organ damage.
Case 1
A 77-year-old female came to the Clinic for Chronic Wounds at KB Merkur, a tertiary care facility in Zagreb, Croatia. She had a history of arterial hypertension of more than 10 years, a past SARS-CoV-2 infection after being vaccinated and a cholecystectomy 10 years ago. At the time of the examination, she had chronic ulcers on both shins, which had been treated

with various dressings for months. She was taking ciprofloxacin 500mg pills BID for a presumed infection at the site of the ulcers, prescribed for 10 days. In her therapy, the patient also had acetylsalicylic acid, bisoprolol, oxazepam, indapamide and lisinopril. The patient interview during the examination revealed that the patient had been demoed the dressings prescribed at the clinic, citing a guideline of the Croatian Bureau of Health Insurance (HZZO) to discontinue a dressing if it did not improve the status of the wound within 28 days. A physical examination revealed five ulcers (three on the right shin and two on the left) with a large volume of green secretion resembling pus. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, a pulse of 61 beats/min, 15 respirations/min. Her oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. A lavage with H2O2 and sterile saline solution was carried out, along with a dressing of 10% NaCl and 10% iodopovidone. The patient was prescribed tramadol 50mg hard capsules for pain from the ulcers and was sent to the emergency internal medicine clinic for further workup following complaints of dyspnea, a dry cough and diarrhea.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood laboratory tests were made.The ECG showed a sinus rhythm with 61 beats per minute and a deviation of the electrical axis to the left, along with a left bundle branch block. The laboratory results showed a prominent leukocytosis of 39.90*10^9 leukocytes, microcytic anemia (Hb 73 g/L, MCV 69.0 fL), high neutrophile to lymphocyte ratio (NEU% 90, LYM% 4.9), hypocoagulable state (PT 0.35), hyperkalemia (6.5 mmol/L), hyponatremia (132 mmol/L), elevated urea (62.9 mmol/L) and creatinine (467 umol/L), elevated liver enzymes (AST 75 U/L, ALT 201 U/L, GGT 100 U/L), elevated CRP (123.3 mg/L) and high-sensitivity troponin I (26 ng/L). An arterial blood gas (ABG) test was also performed and showed an acidosis (pH 7.246) with hypocapnia (pCO2 2.65 kPa), hypobicarbonatemia (HCO3 8.6 mmol/L) and a base excess of -18.7 mmol/L. The patient was hospitalized with a diagnosed infection with multiorgan damage, acute kidney failure (AKF), hepatic damage, cardiac damage, coagulation breakdown), and administered a blood transfusion, antibiotics (piperacilin/tazobactam 4.5mg i.v.) and i.v. fluids (500mL of 5% glucose with 8 units of fast-acting insulin because of hyperkalemia with loop diuretics (due to hyperkalemia a dose of furose-

mide was 80 mg iv). A chest X-ray and an abdominal ultrasound were also made. The X-ray showed an enlarged heart with a cranial redistribution of circulation. The abdominal ultrasound showing no abnormalities.
Case 2
This patient is a 42-year-old male who came to the emergency clinic with a primary complaint of erythema, pain and edema of the right foot. After taking a medical history, it has been established that the patient had been suffering from multiple conditions for more than 10 years, including arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic ulcers on both feet. He had had no medication allergies in the past and reported taking bisoprolol, alogliptin, metformin, ramipril, amlodipine, hydrochlorthiazide, atorvastatin and glargine during his therapy. He had also had COVID-19 at one point in time, with a positive PCR test. Upon examination, the patient's right foot was edematous, red and painful, with pus secreted out of the wound. The foot was missing a second digit, which had been previously amputated. The sole of the foot was red, and the skin looked macerated. Arterial pulses were palpable femorally, but not distally. An emergency doppler ultrasound of the right leg vasculature showed no significant atherosclerotic changes and the flow through the large lower extremity arteries was satisfactory. The deep veins of the leg were compressible, anechoic, without signs of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Blood samples were taken for laboratory analysis and the laboratory test results showed a prominent leukocytosis of 23.33 *10^9 leukocytes/L, an elevated neutrophile to lymphocyte ratio (90.5%/3.9%) indicative of severe inflammation, hyponatremia with a sodium value of 127 mmol/L, hyperglycemia with a blood glucose level of 19.8 mmol/L, a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level of 267.6 mg/L and kidney damage with a serum creatinine value of 273 umol/L. A swab of the wound was taken and sent for microbiological testing. The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery ward and given intravenous antibiotics. Following a 2-week hospitalization, the patient was discharged with instructions to come for control visits and redressing the wound every second day, either at the chronic wound clinic or his primary care provider (PCP). After several weeks of not showing up for control visits and wound redressing, the patient showed up at the emergency ward complaining of right food erythema, edema and pain. The wound

had severely worsened, and a swab was again taken. It came back positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae and type B beta hemolytic streptococcus. The patient was once again admitted to the hospital and a reamputation of the second digit was deemed necessary.
Case 3
This patient is a 68-year-old male who came to the emergency ward complaining of pain and erythema on the left foot and erythema, pain, edema on the right shin. The patient had a medical history of type II diabetes mellitus for more than 20 years, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia and chronic ulcers of both feet. He stated a previous allergic reaction to penicillin and was taking rapid acting insulin, glargine, amlodipine, phenofibrate, atrovastatin, ramipril, hydrochlorthiazidem acetylsalicylic acid, dorzolamide and timolol in his chronic therapy. Upon physical examination, the right leg was erythematous and swollen and the left food was erythematous with a large number of purulent and necrotic deposits inside the wound. A vascular murmur over the carotids was also noted. A wound swab was taken and sent for microbiological testing. The results came back positive for vancomycin sensitive Enterococcus faecalis. A doppler ultrasound of the leg arteries showed diffuse atherosclerotic changes without isolated significant stenotic changes - the finding was deemed overall satisfactory, with a control exam and regulation of risk factors recommended. Blood samples were drawn and sent for analysis. The laboratory test results showed pronounced inflammation with a hs-CRP of 121 mg/L, a hypokalemia with a serum potassium level of 3.3 mmol/L and significant acute kidney injury with a serum creatinine of 306 umol/L. The patient was admitted to the endocrinology ward.
Discussion
The patients presented here were affected by either the reduced regularity of visits to the wound care clinic due to the COVID-19 pandemic or an ineffective and unforgiving bureaucracy that failed to recognize the need of chronic wound patients for regular reapplication of dressings specifically designed to prevent infection. It has been shown that regular visits to the wound care clinic play an extremely important role in preventing infection, One study determining the success of simple mechanical debridement in reducing

bacterial activity inside and peripheral to the wound using fluorescence imaging has shown that a single debridement reduces bacterial activity inside the wound by 99.4% and peripherally by 64.3% (before using antiseptic)3. Wound care clinics are also important because of the psychological effects that procedures such as changing dressings and interviewing the patient about their experience regularly allows for a more personalized approach to each patient, which has been shown to improve the psychological state of patients and the time needed to complete wound healing3,4. In addition to the obvious benefits listed above, regular visits to the wound care clinic also allow for a timely diagnosis of wound infection. Several analyses have shown that there are reliable risk factors for the development of chronic wound infection, most of which can only be evaluated by regular physical examination of the wound: wound area >10 cm3, new, increased or altered wound pain, malodor, increased wound area, erythema, increased wound temperature4 and heavy exudate from the wound5. It is also important for family physicians and bureaucratic entities providing health insurance to recognize and respect the expertise and importance of the wound care surgeon's opinion and findings in order to provide adequate multidisciplinary care to the patient, even outside the wound care clinic and ensure that the same level and quality of care is provided both in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Two of the three patients described in this case series had a history of COVID-19, after which their chronic wounds clinically increased in severity. It is therefore important to discuss the treatment of chronic wound patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, to ensure proper wound care during the acute infection phase, when patients are supposed to be in isolation for 1-2 weeks, and to provide adequate aftercare in the form of more frequent follow-up exams, as it has been shown that not only are chronic wound patients more susceptible to unfavorable COVID-19 outcomes, but that their chronic wounds (and other chronic conditions) can also rapidly progress into their later, more severe stages in the midst of an infection with SARSCoV-2, which has been known to interact with important molecular mechanisms regulating blood vessel tone, integrity and other important properties, so some researches describe this situation as a "pandemic within a pandemic" 6,7.
In conclusion, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many healthcare topics have gone under the

radar, including chronic wound care. Since patients with chronic wounds are at risk of being exposed to z lack of regular care due to the increased load on the healthcare system and having significantly worse COVID-19 outcomes if infected, it is important to recognize the role of multidisciplinary care and proper communication between wound care specialists, family medicine specialists and insurance providers so that this sensitive group of patients will receive the best possible care, especially in these trying times of Covid syndemic.

ABSTRACT: A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has attracted global attention due to its highly infectious and pathogenic properties. Most of current studies focus on aerosols released from infected individuals, but the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater also should be examined. In this review, we used bibliometrics to statistically evaluate the importance of water-related issues in the context of COVID-19. The results show that the levels and transmission possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater are the main concerns, followed by potential secondary pollution by the intensive use of disinfectants, sludge disposal, and the personal safety of workers. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater requires more attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the most effective techniques, i.e., wastewater-based epidemiology and quantitative microbial risk assessment, for virus surveillance in wastewater are systematically analyzed. We further explicitly review and analyze the successful operation of a sewage treatment plant in Huoshenshan Hospital in China as an example and reference for other sewage treatment systems to properly ensure discharge safety and tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. This review offers deeper insight into the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 and similar viruses in the post-COVID19 era from a wastewater perspective.

1. INTRODUCTION
The outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID19) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), resulting in symptoms of coughing, sneezing, etc.1,2 As a single-stranded RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 has caused an increasing number infections because of its high transmissibility.3 The influenced countries have taken emergency measures to minimize the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which has become a hot topic around the world.4,5 Researches are focusing on the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in water, wastewater, sludge, and air and on surfaces to assess the risk of contracting the virus from contaminated environments.6,7 People have paid a great deal of attention to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols, and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 being spread in wastewater cannot be ignored.8,9 Bhatt et al. summarized the presence of SARSCoV-2 in wastewater, showing substantial evidence of the existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and other pathogenic bacteria in wastewater.10,11 SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be released from COVID-19 patients into wastewater12 and subsequently enter the sewage pipe networks in hospitals or communities, although no confirmed cases from wastewater and fecal-oral transmission have yet been reported.13-15 During the COVID-

19 pandemic, sewage treatment plants face more serious threats from emerging contaminants, including a variety of disinfectants, antibiotics, drugs, and viruses, raising new challenges for wastewater treatment management.16
The serious threats posed by the fecal-oral route are the main concern for wastewater during the outbreak of COVID19, and more problems arise from water contaminated by the coronavirus.17 Theoretically, potential routes of transmission of the virus to humans include directly touching contaminated surface water or groundwater, bathing or swimming in contaminated water, and eating contaminated seafoods or crops in contaminated soils.18-20 We used bibliometrics in this study to assess the recent research highlights of this topic and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the presence and spillover of SARS-CoV-2 in water environments.

used surveillance methods like wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) and quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) are systematically reviewed and analyzed to provide insights into their proper application during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, the combination of WBE and QMRA is proposed for water safety management in the COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 era. Lastly, the successful operation of sewage treatment facilities and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in different treatment sectors in Huoshenshan Hospital in China are explicitly discussed to offer a reference for other sewage treatment systems facing the challenges of treating SARS-CoV2-containing wastewater during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS
As a widely accepted method for quantifying and analyzing big data by keyword retrieval, bibliometrics offers a good opportunity to carry out a comprehensive study of scientific topics or subjects.21,22 Here, we use bibliometrics to visualize the hot points related to coronavirus and discuss the future research trends. The keywords "coronavirus" and "water" were chosen for a search of all literature in the Web of Science on December 31, 2020, and the publication date was set from 2020 without language restrictions. In total, 296 articles were retrieved, and 254 papers were finally selected for further analysis after repetitive and irrelevant articles had been screened out. The "Analytical Search Results tool" was used to analyze these articles, identifying countries and regions that paid a great deal of attention to water-related concerns caused by the coronavirus. WBE and QMRA, as important methods for epidemic surveillance and prevention, were widely applied in the fight against COVID-19.23-25 They were then both used as the keywords for a search with the same retrieval method to provide insights into their principles and recent applications. All of these papers were thoroughly read and scientifically analyzed in detail.

3. BIBLIOMETRICS ANALYSIS
The number of articles with the keywords of "coronavirus" and "water" in the Web of Science from 2011 to 2020 is illustrated in Figure 1a. It remained at a low level (3-10 articles per year) from 2011 to 2019, and a dramatic increase was found in 2020 when 254 articles were retrieved. Obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted significant attention to the risks and safety management of water environments. Figure 1b shows the country-based distribution of the 254 retrieved articles. The United States and China together contributed to 50% of the relevant publications, indicating that the researchers from these two countries participated most in the investigation of the impacts of coronaviruses on water environments. In addition, the most productive journals (e.g., Science of the Total Environment and International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health) are closely linked to the "environmental" area , hinting that more attention is being paid to the potential impacts of the coronavirus on the environment and human health (Figure 1c).
As tools for monitoring pathogens, WBE (Figure 2a) and QMRA (Figure 2b) have been widely applied for wastewater surveillance and become popular. Considering the requirements of sewage management and monitoring, WBE and QMRA can rapidly detect viruses in the sewage and establish a specific diffusion model to support the epidemiological study of infectious diseases.23,26 As shown in Figure 2, WBE-related publications have significantly grown in 2020, whereas the number articles addressing QMRA has remained relatively stable. This indicates that researchers have recognized the important roles of WBE in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in wastewater. Although the role of QMRA cannot be denied in the analysis and quantification of harmful microorganisms, including viruses, viral load is normally small and challenges the assessment. Therefore, current QMRA usually optimizes the parameters and assess the risks on the basis of mathematical models (Table 2). In addition, application of

Figure 2. Annual and cumulative numbers of articles about (a) WBE and (b) QMRA published from 2010 to 2020.
QMRA focuses more on the microbiological risk assessment but lacks a successful case analysis in sewage.25,27 Accordingly, WBE is more recommended for epidemiological studies of infectious diseases rather than QMRA in environmental research.
4. WATER-RELATED CONCERNS AND STRATEGIES FOR CONTROLLING CORONAVIRUSES
4.1. Impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on the Utilization of Water Resources. Water resources are critical for human life and regional socioeconomic health.28,29 However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic increases the risk of water pathogenic contamination and poses a challenge for water utilization. For the cities with superior water resources, often accompanied by high population densities, both water shortage and the possibility of viral transmission increase during the pandemic.12 More seriously, the regions with limited water resources may be troubled by more severe problems, including water pollution, poor sanitation, a lack of clean water, etc.30,31 The process of fetching water resources (such as the process of queuing or the contact of water containers) or washing with water resources that cannot meet the World Health Organization's sanitation standards will bring a greater risk of cross-infection.32,33 In addition, countries and regions with water scarcity are more likely to use wastewater for irrigation, which might increase the likelihood of accumulation of the virus in crops or soils.34,35 These potential risks in water

environments necessitate a systematic review of the current technologies for monitoring and controlling viruses in water and wastewater.
4.2. Persistence and Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in
Water Environments. SARS-CoV-2 causes diarrhea and hampers the gastrointestinal function of humans.36 A large number of viruses in excreta may be discharged into the municipal sewage network and remain active in the sewage for a prolonged period of time, posing a risk of exposure to operators.37,38 During the COVIP-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials were widely detected in fecal wastewater.39-41 More precisely, septic tanks for wastewater (especially hospital wastewater) contain large amounts of fecal debris and suspended solids, which poses significant risks by releasing viruses from these organic solids.42 Considering the fact that 1.8 billion people worldwide still use cleaned fecalcontaminated water as drinking water, it is very important to take this transmission route into account.12,43
Furthermore, it has been found that most fecally transmitted viruses are highly persistent in the aquatic environment. SARSCoV-2 is an enveloped virus and more likely to be inactivated than non-enveloped viruses.44-46 However, enveloped viruses have similar persistent rates compared to those of nonenveloped ones in dark water environments as determined by viral decay constants.47 Additionally, the persistence of SARSCoV-2 RNA is significantly longer than that of other closely related coronaviruses. For example, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present in wastewater for 7 days, longer than human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E (2 days).47,48 The long persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in water leads to the nonneglectable significance of its potential transmission in water environments. Researchers have found that the time that SARS-CoV-2 persists is different in wastewater (>7 days) and groundwater (>10 weeks), indicating that SARS-CoV-2 is subject to environmental factors.49 Additionally, enveloped SARS-CoV-2 possibly has stronger mobility in the underground aquifer systems and viral adsorption on soil is crucially affected by pH, ion strength, and soil properties, posing challenges in virus detection and control.50 Consequently, the persistence, transmission, and risks of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater are affected by many factors, including viral load, viral activity, viral survival time, water type, and organic or microbial matter in water.44,51,52 Correspondingly, pertinent evaluation and detection methods should be adopted according to these real-world scenario, to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of water surveillance.53
4.3. Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in Water Environ-
ments. SARS-CoV-2 can remain stable in feces and wastewater for a long time at low temperatures.54 To prevent the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, virus inactivation is imperative. The main methods of inactivating SARS-CoV-2 in a wastewater environment include the following. (1) SARS-CoV-2 is more vulnerable to ultraviolet (UV) (254 nm) exposure than is non-enveloped virus, and the exposure time for effective inactivation is just several seconds.55 (2) The thermal effect for the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 is confirmed effectively at 70 °C in 5.7 min.49 (3) Chemical disinfection quenched viral infectivity within a short exposure time as the most effective and economical solution.56 Thus, a large number of disinfectants (chlorine disinfectants, hypochlorous acid, ozone, etc.) have been applied to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.57-60 At present, chlorine disinfectants are most widely used, as free chlorine could effectively inactivate SARS-

Review

CoV-2 by destroying the proteins on its envelope.56 Despite the rapid response around the world, SARS-CoV-2 continues to show a pandemic trend due to the shortage of disinfectants. Extensive efforts have been devoted to developing new disinfectants or disinfection alternatives for the effective control of SARS-CoV-2.11,61,62 Unfortunately, the overuse of disinfectants may cause the entrance of the disinfectants into the city sewer network or surrounding water bodies through rainwater or wastewater, which may lead to an accumulation of disinfectants in surface waters during the outbreaks. This would present an emerging problem with a serious concern about the disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Methods for the accurate and swift determination of DBPs should be explored to reduce their risks to human health.63
4.4. Surveillance and Assessment of SARS-CoV-2.
Infectious diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens have become one of the main threats to public health. Efficient monitoring of viral transmission is critical for the control and prevention of infectious diseases.64 Although SARS-CoV-2 is considered as a respiratory virus, it also leads to intestinal infections and can be detected in feces and wastewater.65,66 As a result, there is growing concern about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in water environments. In particular, the greatest risk arises in wastewater discharged from communities where COVID-19 patients, asymptomatic patients, and medical staff are concentrated.67,68 It is reported that the presence of coronaviruses in wastewater can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the viral load in communities.24 To meet the needs of virus surveillance in wastewater, cost-effective and real-time monitoring protocols should be proposed. WBE, which can provide comprehensive assessments of the viral load in water environments, has been rapidly developed.64 In addition, as an optimized protocol for SARS-CoV-2 assessment, the quantitative microbial risk assessment is also limited for exploring a modeling-based approach. As a consequence, standardized information about QMRA is summarized in a table to obtain an implementation scheme of risk assessments from previous studies.
4.4.1. Application of WBE during the COVID-19 Outbreak.
Waterborne viruses are the main cause of many diseases. They can be ingested through contaminated drinking water or food, inhaled through droplets or aerosols, or contagiously injested through contact mucosa or wounds, finally leading to infection. As the wastewater environment is reported to shield SARSCoV-2 over 7 days due to the rich organic matter,49 the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater or soil might pose remarkable risks to the surroundings. WBE is a method for analyzing the concentrations of target substances in the sewage of a specific area and then assessing its consumption within the region.69 It was first applied in the monitoring of illicit drugs since being introduced in 2001.70-72 Recently, researchers proposed WBE as a strong surveillance tool for monitoring waterborne viruses (such as osteomyelitis virus) and have achieved excellent performance.73
In tackling COVID-19 pneumonia, it is crucial to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses in water, especially wastewater environments, for effective prevention and control. In particular, the existence of asymptomatic patients carrying SARS-CoV-2 necessitates wider detection. By analyzing SARSCoV-2 RNA in wastewater, WBE can qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the health status of residents within a certain area.74,75 The introduction of WBE can identify viruses that exist in feces and sewage even when local residents show

mild or no symptoms,76 which might serve as an early warning system during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, WBE can work as an tool for long-term surveillance of not only emerging but also re-emerging viruses in a community.23 As shown in Table 1, the spatial and temporal accuracy of sampling should be improved for WBE, which can help in confirming the expected critical pathways.77 In addition, the collection and concentration methods are important in WBE to provide the exact data for viral load evaluation.
Recently, a WBE-based building sewage monitoring system was reported and successfully identified nine potential COVID-19 patients carrying SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong.78 During the entire wastewater monitoring process, they paid more attention to the sampling location, time, and frequency. First, the sampling point should be carefully chosen to locate the specific building clearly. Second, the sampling time is a key factor in WBE because appropriate sampling after discharge of feces can ensure a sufficient viral titer. Thus, the sampling time was 8:00 to 11:00 in the morning, and four samples were collected at hourly intervals. Subsequently, the 12 samples were mixed to be employed as a representative sample. Lastly, virus concentration and extraction are crucial to improve the accuracy of the results. In addition, the support and cooperation from government departments are significant to the success of WBE. As mentioned above, the application of WBE in Hong Kong successfully helped in the identification of COVID-19 patients and prevention of the spread of SARSCoV-2. This sewage monitoring system for buildings developed by the University of Hong Kong offered an excellent example to fight against COVID-19 with the aid of WBE and imply virus control in water environments. Accordingly, WBE is recommended as an initial warning tool, which can contribute to the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients and the measures for quick response strategies.46,83-85
4.4.2. Effective Risk Assessment of QMRA. Microbial risk assessment is another method for risk analysis to protect public health. QMRA is a process for identifying and quantifying the adverse effects of exposure to certain microorganisms on human health by using the established scientific data and appropriate experimental methods, eventually providing a description of the risk characteristic.86 It mainly includes risk assessment, risk management, and risk information. On the basis of scientific evaluation, QMRA carries out hazard identification, hazard characterization, exposure assessment, and risk characterization.87 QMRA is a valuable tool for supporting water safety plans and could be used to assess human health risks associated with exposure to pathogens in different environmental matrices.88,89 Therefore, QMRA is suitable for addressing the following questions raised by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) to identify the risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in different wastewaters by determining the diffusion mode and volatilization rate, (2) to determine the safe distance and areas regarding the outbreak of COVID-19, and (3) to evaluate the disinfection technology for inactivating SARS-CoV-2. Recently, QMRA in empirical mode has been proposed for virus assessment of virus, aiming at sewage from different sources,25,90,91 because QMRA can develop a scalable model for interpreting case reporting data and predicting the risk of spread of viruses. From 762 articles in the Web of Science on QMRA application for coronavirus (Table 2), we summarize the details of assessment steps and risk assessment procedures. It is worth noting that the parameters should be modified during this dynamic process and the relationships

between virus and environmental factors crucially affect the results. An effective implementation scheme of QMRA in water environments is necessary for its successful application during the COVID-19 pandemic.
As predicted by many experts, the COVID-19 will last irregularly or seasonally for a long period, and SARS-CoV-2 is very likely to coexist with human beings.97 Therefore, establishing the immunological barrier to SARS-CoV-2 is essential. At present, all countries around the world are actively developing vaccines against COVID-19 for herd immunity, the threshold of which can be achieved only with a high vaccination rate of 60-70% of the population. Some experts have alleged that herd immunity to COVID-19 is probably impossible.98 Accordingly, before herd immunity can be achieved, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in water environments is significant in preventing the wide outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. WBE can be employed to monitor the spasmodic infection cases in real time. With the expected immunization effect, the application of WBE in the future will be different from the patterns we used now, e.g., lower sampling frequency with the improvement in monitoring sensitivity. In addition to the successful WBE case qualitatively discovering potential patients as described above in Hong Kong,99 future WBE should provide a quantitative assessment of risks in different regions instead of only the numbers of patients and predict the trends of the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, QMRA can establish the relationships between influential factors and the degree of infection based on a small number of spasmodic cases, providing an effective warning.89,93 The interactive risk assessment model obtained by QMRA will be used to trace the source of infection cases with a posteriori probability.

Treatment Plants. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been widely identified in fecal particles and is protected by the surrounding organic matter after being discharged into wastewater.67 Without sufficient disinfectants, these viruses may again be released into the aqueous water. As a result, the test result can still be positive regardless of whether water has been disinfected. In addition, the overdose of disinfectants can cause the secondary contamination problem in which a large number of DBPs (e.g., chloroform, chlorite, etc.) accumulate in wastewater and pose ecological risks.67,100,101 For example, the residual chlorine can affect the persistence of ecological morphology and damage the respiratory systems or organs.102 Chlorine-containing disinfectants may even react with organic substances in water to produce BPPs, which pose more serious risks to human health and the ecological environment.103 Therefore, the use of chlorine-containing disinfectants should be reasonably regulated and substitute disinfectants require further development.
During the COVID-19 outbreak, sewage treatment plants face the problem of sludge disposal.104 Suspended particles from SARS-CoV-2-containing sludge might be produced and aerosolized into the air during the sludge treatment process.105 In addition, after being directly transported to a land use area, sludge can release SARS-CoV-2 into surrounding soils, which might maintain infectivity for at least 10 weeks and even cause groundwater pollution.106,107 Currently, cement kiln incineration is the most common way to treat sludge from urban sewage treatment plants.37 During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a large gap in sludge disposal due to the suspension of some cement production enterprises.108 Certainly, sewage treatment plants, as the most important basic facilities in cities, are greatly significant for protecting the water environment and public health. Therefore, the operation of the sewage treatment facilities needs to be standardized, and

this review comprehensively discusses the details in Huoshenshan Hospital.
4.5.2. Successful Control of Contaminated Wastewater in
China. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, China took timely and effective measures to prevent and control the initial spread in Wuhan.12,109-111 Two specialized emergency hospitals for COVID-19 patients were established in China (Leishenshan Hospital and Huoshenshan Hospital) and received more than 5000 COVID-19 patients. Strict treatment measures were employed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spillover or spread into the surrounding environment, including wastewater treatment processes. As the two hospitals have the same design capacity of the sewage treatment plant, the design and operation of the facilities for wastewater treatment in Huoshenshan Hospital are representative and described in detail to provide an example and reference for other operational problems of medical wastewater, which is also of great significance for the protection of public health.112
The building area of Huoshenshan Hospital is 33900 m2, and a total of 1000 beds are designed for COVID-19 patients. The drainage pipe network collecting rainwater, sewage from a contaminated area (patient wards), and sewage from a clean area (staff living areas) separately is properly designed and illustrated in panels a and c of Figure 3. To meet landfill standards, Huoshenshan Hospital uses the high-density polyethylene (HPDE) and the basement adopts impervious "composite geomembrane". Therefore, there is minimal impact or risk of medical activities on groundwater. The treatment process adopted by the Huoshenshan Hospital sewage treatment station is shown in Figure 3b.
The main task of this water treatment station in Huoshenshan Hospital is to disinfect SARS-CoV-2 viruses and ensure the safety of discharged water. Wastewater is first treated in a presterilized contact pool, which has a designed scale of 40 m3/h with two groups, an average hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3 h, and a maximum HRT of 5 h for each group. As wastewater contains a large amount of feces debris responsible for virus release, the water treatment station separates suspended solids from the wastewater in the predisinfection tank to avoid the long-term presence of feces particles and virus release.67 Chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite are used as the disinfectants for wastewater, and the designed dosage is 40 mg/L (in terms of residual chlorine). Wastewater is then transferred into five reinforced fiberglass septic tanks with an effective volume of 100 m3 to

preprecipitate suspended solids. Simultaneously, partial dichlorination is employed in the septic tanks to reduce the stress of regulating the reservoir. Effluent from the septic tank is raised to the regulating reservoir by lifting pumps. Subsequently, the wastewater is treated in the moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR), which is designed in parallel with an HRT of 5.6 h. Sludge from MBBR is separated in the coagulation and sedimentation tanks, stored in the auxiliary sludge concentration tank, and then treated in the sludge thickener. A sodium hypochlorite solution is added to the sludge thickener by the metering pump for the sludge deactivation. After gravity concentration in a concentration tank, the supernatant is discharged back into the regulating reservoir. The concentrated sludge is transferred into the spiral dewatering machine by the sludge screw pump. When the dewatering machine is started, cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) is added for conditioning and sludge dehydration. The filtrate from the dewatering machine is pumped into the regulating reservoir again.
The designed flow rate of secondary disinfection is 40 m3/h for two groups, with an average residence time of 3 h, a maximum residence time of 5 h, and a unit chlorine dosage of 25 mg/L (in terms of available chlorine). Meanwhile, the design of disinfection equipment possesses a certain surplus capacity, which can be adjusted flexibly according to the actual operational situation of the treatment station to fully guarantee the disinfection effects.
The waste gas from the sewage treatment station and patient wards (negative pressure) in Huoshenshan Hospital may contain SARS-CoV-2.113 Additionally, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia methanethiol, burning soot sulfur, and other toxic waste gases will be generated during the sewage treatment process and the incineration of medical waste. Accordingly, the waste gas requires a careful treatment for avoiding potential risks to the medical staffs and secondary air pollution in the surrounding area. The waste gas from the sewage treatment sector is discharged after the combination of activated carbon adsorption and UV photolysis oxidation. The waste gas from medical waste incineration is first cooled and then treated by desulfurization and deacidification. Afterward, the waste gas is collected using a polyether (PE) microporous dust collector and finally adsorbed by activated carbon. Via the control of the air volume in and out of the wards, pressure gradients are formed between different areas to ensure appropriate air flow from the clean area to the contaminated area. Finally, the

Review

indoor air pressure is kept 15 Pa lower than outdoors. The exhaust duct is equipped with an antivirus device to sterilize the discharged air to meet the requirements of environmental protection and COVID-19 prevention. The design and operation of the Huoshenshan Hospital exhaust gas treatment system can provide a reference for the exhaust gas treatment of emergency respiratory hospitals for infectious diseases.
During the operation of Huoshenshan Hospital, the residual chlorine in effluent and other wastewater quality parameters were monitored in real time to ensure the treatment efficiency and safety of the sewage treatment system. As shown in Figure 4a, the daily treated wastewater did not exceed the maximum designed treatment capacity (1920 m3/day). However, the wastewater flux was significantly affected by the rainfall when it exceeded 20 mm a day (February 26 and March 29). As illustrated in Figure 4b, the levels of residual chlorines in the effluent met the standard. The dilution effect of rainwater led to a decrease in the level of of organic matter in influent and caused the carbon level to be insufficient. Thus, the COD removal efficiency in MBBR was decreased.
The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the sewage treatment system (wastewater, soil, and aerosol) of Huoshenshan Hospital is illustrated in Figure 5.114 Among 10 wastewater,
Figure 5. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the sewage treatment system of Huoshenshan Hospital.
three aerosol, and two soil samples collected from all reactors (Figure 3b), three wastewater samples, one aerosol sample, and one soil sample were positive for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 levels in the first regulating reservoir, MBBR, and sedimentation tank were 633, 505, and 2208 copies/L, respectively. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected in effluents after disinfection, indicating that complete disinfection is greatly important for removing SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and securing discharge safety. As for aerosol samples, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected only in the septic tank (603 copies/m3), suggesting that aerosol SARS-CoV-2 mainly came from the aerosolized droplets from the feces debris of the COVID-19 patients. The soil samples collected from 2 m distance to the first regulating reservoir contained a significant level of SARS-CoV2 RNA (550 copies/g). Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in surrounding aerosols and soils of Wuchang Cabin Hospital because of the temporary enclosed system, which effectively prevented the spread of SARS-CoV-2.114 It is suggested that the appropriate sealing of the wastewater treatment system may prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV2.

Hand hygiene and ocular protection are critical for preventing COVID-19 cases among staff in sewage treatment plants.115-117 It is most important to have sufficient COVID19 personal protective equipment during the operation and maintenance period. For staffs, daily double temperature measurement and regular disinfection should be strictly carried out to ensure their safety. Centralized medical observation for working staff should be arranged after work to ensure no safety accidents.
5. CONCLUSION
Although there has been no confirmed case of COVID-19 from SARS-CoV-2 transmission in wastewater to date, a significant number of studies have demonstrated that water safety is a major hidden danger in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies have focused on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, and the widely accepted methods are WBE and QMRA. From the comprehensive analysis in this review, WBE is the most reliable surveillance method tackling the COVID-19 for its rapid response and thus should be further developed and widely applied. Supplementarily, QMRA provides a strategy for assessing human health risks associated with exposure to pathogens in different environmental matrices. The successful operation of Huoshenshan Hospital helps the successful prevention and control of COVID-19 in China and also provides references for the operation and management of sewage treatment systems around the world for the post-
COVID-19 era. AUTHOR INFORMATION

ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies have been conducted on the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, how the mental health of health workers will be affected among the number of peaks during the pandemic has not been evaluated yet. The study aims to investigate the effects of the first, second, and third peaks of COVID-19 on anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms in healthcare workers. METHODS: The current study included 4031 healthcare workers, 1051 during the first peak period, 1409 during the second peak period, and 1571 during the third peak period. The Depression Anxiety Stress scale21(DASS-21) was used to assess the participants' levels of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 33.74 ± 7.95, and 2634 (66.3 %) were female. 36.9 %(n = 1486) of the participants were physicians, 41.1 % (n = 1655) were nurses and 22.1 % (n = 890) were other healthcare workers. A statistically significant difference was documented in the DASS-21 anxiety (F(2:4028) = 502.893, p < 0.001, Post-hoc = 3. Peak > 2. Peak > 1. Peak), DASS-21 depression (F(2:4028) = 46.034, p < 0.001, Post-hoc = 3. Peak > 2. Peak > 1. Peak), DASS-21 stress (F(2:4028) = 65.548, p < 0.001, Post-hoc = 3. Peak = 2. Peak > 1. Peak), and DASS-21 total scores (F(2:4028) = 156.860, p < 0.001, Post-hoc = 3. Peak > 2. Peak > 1. Peak) of healthcare workers during all three peak periods. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that as the peak number rises, so do the levels of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers. As a result, it is possible to assert that prolongation of the COVID-19 pandemic worsens mental problems (Tab. 2, Fig. 3, Ref. 35). Text in PDF www.elis.sk KEY WORDS: anxiety, COVID-19, depression.

Introduction
Despite the development of vaccines for COVID-19 infection, the pandemic has still significant health, economic, and social consequences for many people (1). Many studies have shown that COVID-19 has negative mental effects on both patients and healthy people (2). It is foreseen that if the pandemic is prolonged, these effects will have devastating consequences (3). It is obvi-

ous that the social and economic consequences of the pandemic process affect all societies, including developed countries (4, 5). Furthermore, it is certain that the feelings of loneliness, boredom, irritability, restlessness, anger, anxiety, sadness, worry, and family problems, which continue to rise as a result of measures such as school closure, quarantine, exacerbate mental problems (6). Individuals who live far away from their families and loved ones for reasons such as education or work, as well as the elderly who live alone, are more likely to develop mental disorders such as depression and anxiety (7). It is not hard to predict that if the pandemic is prolonged, mental health problems will get worse.
The fact that the number of cases and official records from around the world can be shared online has revealed that the number of cases in various countries fluctuates, with ups and downs and peaks (8). Following the spread of COVID-19 in March 2020, various countries experienced their second and even third peak in their history. As a result, numerous studies have been conducted to investigate possible mood swings between these various peaks (9, 10). The studies focused on the peak periods of the number of cases and the examinations of healthcare workers on mental health through variables such as burnout, somatic symptoms,

health status, job satisfaction, and the anxiety and depression levels of the general population (11, 12). The results show that negative mental symptoms generally increase in the second peak periods when compared to the first peak periods (10, 13). In a study conducted with Italian nurses, there was no significant difference in anxiety levels between the two peak waves, but there was a significant increase in depression levels between the two peaks (9). We completed and published a study that compared the first two peaks of this study. In the first part of our study, we concluded that the second peak, when the number of cases of healthcare workers in our country increased again, resulted in significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress than the first peak (10). To summarize, the differences between the peaks indicate that the peaks also have mental health reflections. Besides, studies on the mental effects of COVID-19 peaks in the literature tend to focus on the differences between the two peaks. This is most likely due to the fact that most countries have experienced two peaks. However, despite the fact that there are countries with three peaks, there has been no research on the mental effects of these peaks that we know.
In light of all of this information, the aim of this study is to compare the anxiety, depression, and stress levels of healthcare workers in three different peaks as a follow-up to the study that

compared the anxiety, depression, and stress levels of healthcare professionals in two peaks.
Material and methods
Participants The sample of the current cross-sectional study consists of
the doctors, nurses, and healthcare assistants working in the COVID-19 related units during the peak periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included 4031 healthcare workers, 1051 during the first peak period, 1409 during the second peak period, and 1571 during the third peak period. The study's inclusion criteria were determined to be between the ages of 18 and 65, not to have a major psychiatric illness, to have worked in a COVID-19-related unit for at least 15 days, to have experienced a pandemic peak during the period of study, and to volunteer to participate. An online survey was used to invite participants to the study, and informed consent was obtained online. Only consented participants were able to access and fill in the scales. Re-participation through the online scale has been disabled. Scales that were filled in incomplete or out of instruction were excluded from the study. The study was conducted under the responsibility of Psychiatry Department of Kirikkale Yuksek Ihtisas Hospital. Local ethics committee ap-

the first and second peaks (10). The most likely explanation for this result is that the study's population was made up of healthcare workers who were at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because the fact

significant factor. It should also be accepted that they are the group most affected by this period (9, 25). When viewed in this light, it is possible that no negative mental state exists between the peaks in studies conducted in the general population or with students (19, 21-23, 26). Studies conducted with healthcare workers confirm the negative effect of peaks according to our article (9, 27). However, it is possible that pandemic-related mental symptoms such as insomnia and burnout of healthcare workers may cause an increase in anxiety and depressive symptoms (23). Furthermore, the fact that healthcare workers are more aware the consequences of the disease and are more likely to comply with measures such as isolation and restriction as they face the consequences may be a contributing factor to the current outcome (19). Although healthcare workers are aware of the importance of seeking psychological assistance and accessing mental health services, time constraints and difficult working conditions can prevent them from doing so (21). Although a vaccine for COVID-19 infection has been dis-

covered, it is not possible to say that it can cause a positive effect that can provide psychological relief to healthcare workers during our country's peak period. Traumatic events such as the demise of patients and colleagues experienced by healthcare workers during the pandemic may increase anxiety and depressive symptoms as a result of PTSD symptoms (28, 29). Staying away from activities that positively affect mental health, such as not being able to engage in social activities and not being able to do physical activities such as sports and walking, may have an effect on the increase in anxiety and depression when compared to non-health workers (28). Finally, SARS CoV-2 mutations and their effects, which emerge as a result of close monitoring of scientific developments, can have a negative impact on healthcare workers (28, 29). Given all of this information, the increase in symptoms of healthcare workers during the pandemic should be regarded as expected.
Another significant finding of our study is that stress symptoms in healthcare workers did not increase in the third peak when compared to the second peak (22). The most likely explanation for this result is that healthcare workers' mental resilience began to improve, and they began to develop coping mechanisms. On the other hand, increasing vaccination applications and developing policies to support them might be perceived as a sign of hope and reduce the mental strain on healthcare workers (26, 30). Individuals may feel less helpless if they believe the pandemic will end (31). The relaxed restriction practices may also have provided some relief to individuals (1). The long duration of the pandemic may have increased people's ability to find and use self-sufficiency behaviors to manage their stress (32). Previous research has found a link between self-sufficiency and stress and anxiety levels, and that self-sufficiency may be protective against depression (33, 34).
Another finding from our study was that, even after the vaccination campaign was launched to provide social immunity throughout the country and public awareness of the infection increased, COVID-19 test positivity in healthcare workers continued to rise. It is worth noting that these results are significantly higher when compared to the general population. It is certain that this disease, as well as the risk of transmitting a disease to their relatives, has a negative impact on the mental health of healthcare workers (29).
It is well known that during the pandemic duration, the economic situation deteriorates, job opportunities become scarce, income inequality increases and purchasing power declines. (10) However, previous research has shown that people with low incomes and who are economically disadvantaged are at a higher risk of developing depression symptoms (19). In our study, as in the literature, the economic situation deteriorated compared to previous peak periods, and so did the income-expenditure balance. Although our country's health sector has more job opportunities than other sectors, it was thought that the reason for this economic deterioration, which we determined in our study, could be financial difficulties experienced by individuals working in other sectors in the family, in addition to the economic effects of the pandemic on countries (29).
We discovered that the number of people living with their families increased in the last wave of the pandemic compared to previous periods. The reason for this is that, in the early stages

837

Bratisl Med J 2022; 123 (11)
833 - 839
of the pandemic, healthcare workers did not want to stay in their own homes for fear of infecting their family members, but as the methods of infection protection were better understood during the pandemic, the uncertainty regarding the infection was slightly reduced, and the vaccine reached the family members of healthcare workers and the financial challenges of out-of-home accommodation made the workers thinking of going back home. However, as previously stated, the reason there is no significant relationship between the stress levels of healthcare workers between the last two peak periods can be attributed to the fact that returning to the home environment, which is a social interaction area, and providing family support increases the capacity to tolerate stress (35).
The results of this study can be evaluated within some limitations. The first is that psychometric measurements could not be taken in all three peaks of the study's same healthcare workers. Because of health policies, healthcare workers alternately work in COVID-19-related clinics. As a result, healthcare workers who worked in COVID-19-related units during peak periods were included in the study. A second limitation is that the participants' depression, anxiety, and stress levels during the pre-pandemic period are unknown, and the sample population does not represent the entire universe. Secondly, the fact that participants reported their current problems through online communication channels via self-report scales may have prevented the conduction of an objective evaluation. The last limitation is that the long-term consequences of the physical and mental symptoms of healthcare workers could not be evaluated prospectively due to the crosssectional design of the study.
Conclusion
Despite the information on the infection, vaccination studies, and public awareness studies, as a result of this research conducted on the mental health of healthcare workers working at the forefront in the fight against the pandemic, the reasons such as healthcare workers' workload, lack of equipment, uncertainties about when the pandemic will end, and burnout revealed that healthcare workers have experienced higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms in the third peak period compared to the second peak period. It is critical to provide psychological counseling to healthcare workers across the country, regulate working conditions, and arrange treatment as needed owing to this situation.

Abstract: Global industrial chains (GICs) have become a hallmark of the world economy
underpinning the global production cycle. Since the reform and opening up was introduced in 1978, China has taken an active role in global value chains (GVCs) and become the world's factory floor. Under the external shocks to GICs, such as US trade frictions with China and the COVID-19 pandemic, China's traditional comparative advantages in manufacturing which include its labor force and costs are waning. This has manifested in a wave of industrial relocations from China to other countries as well as China's weakening international competitiveness. We took stock of the concepts and journey of GVCs and elaborated the intrinsic relationship between GVCs and the new development pattern of "dual circulations". We also analyzed the trends of GVCs, the current status and problems of China's industrial chains, and China's market heft, complete industrial chains and the digital economy as new strengths for industrial chain upgrade. In our conclusion, this paper put forth some policy recommendations for China's industrial chain upgrade in the context of dual circulations.

1. Introduction
Global value chains (GVCs) are a natural trend of the global division of labor and a result of the global allocation of resources by multinational corporations. Historically, global supply chains centered around Europe and North America as manufacturing hubs before evolving into a global supply chain system with Europe, North America, Germany and Japan at the first echelon and the Four Asian Tigers at the second echelon. Since the dawn of the 21st century, China has climbed up the GVC ladder and replaced Japan as Asia's trade hub. The United States, China and Germany have become three regional hubs of the GICs system. After nearly three decades of development, GVCs are faced with multifaceted challenges under the superimposed effects of China-US trade frictions and the COVID-19 pandemic. The fragility of modern supply chains is particularly evident in the context of changes in the world today unseen over the past century and exacerbated by COVID-19. In the midst of the pandemic, supply chain

disruptions for some industries upended the highly concentrated GICs system, prompting countries and firms to rethink their supply chains from the dimensions of security, stability and diversification.
Amid rapid restructuring of the global production network, China needs to upgrade its industrial chains to keep pace with changing GVC layouts while creating a new, high quality development pattern. In this context, the CPC Central Committee has made an important, science-based assessment and strategic choice to "create a new development pattern with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other".1 Under the new development pattern, the coordination, efficiency and security of domestic and international value chains are China's top priority. Based on this analysis, this paper reviews relevant concepts and theories of GVCs, examines the trends of GVCs, and offers some policy recommendations on China's industrial competitiveness and industrial chain upgrade based on supply chain strengths in the context of the "dual circulations".
2. GVCs and the New Development Pattern
2.1 Concepts of Industrial, Supply and Value Chains The idea of industrial chains originated from British classical economist Adam Smith's discussions
on the division of labor. Early Western economists believed that industrial chains were primarily driven by internal activities within individual manufacturing companies. With the expansion of capitalist production, Alfred Marshall (1962), the founder of the neoclassical school of economics, extended the division of labor to one between firms, laying the foundation for the modern industrial chain theory (Marshall, 1962). Although the concept of industrial chains originates from Western neoclassical economic theories, Western academics have yet to systematically investigate industrial chains as an independent tier of economic organization (Zhang and Wu, 2011). Instead, they focus their researches on the manifestations of industrial chains (Shao and Li, 2007; Cheng, et al., 2008).
Overall, two intrinsic characteristics can be found in the definitions of industrial, value and supply chains: (i) The division of labor in production. From the perspective of economics, the division of labor is an intrinsic attribute of industrial, value and supply chains. The idea of industrial chains stems from British classical economist Adam Smith's statement on the division of labor and its economic growth effects. Baldwin (2013) believed that the division of labor in production had undergone two critical rounds of unbundling, i.e. the first round of division of labor that started with the Industrial Revolution driven by steam engines and the second round of division of labor driven by progress in information and communication technologies (ICTs). Each division has led to a further geographical diffusion of production. (ii) Production cycle. Industrial, value and supply chains are manifestations of economic circulation on the supply side. Industrial chains, value chains or supply chains embody a chain or network structure of R&D design, processing and manufacturing, and marketing. They comprise a production cycle and are the manifestations of economic circulation on the supply side. When such production cycle is confined to a country or region, a domestic value chain is formed and constitutes the bulk of a domestic circulation. When it is extended to the international division of labor, an international value chain comes into existence and becomes the core of an international circulation. In this sense, a "dual circulations" development pattern is manifested as GVCs on the supply side.
Yet, differences exist in the definitions of industrial, value and supply chains. The first difference is between materials and value. Supply chains provide goods and services and reflect the supply, demand and distribution of materials. Supply chain management aims to match supply with demand at the lowest cost and with the highest efficiency. Value chains transmit the value embodied in products or services and reflect value creation and profit distribution. The second difference is between macro and

micro dimensions. Industrial chains form the supply and demand relationship for the exchanges of raw materials, technologies, intermediate inputs and services between upstream and downstream enterprises. Supply chain links are the foundation for industrial chain production, and industrial chains integrate various sorts of supply chains. While supply chains have more to do with the management and decisionmaking at the firm level, government authorities make policies based on broader considerations of industrial and value chains. Moreover, industrial chains are the material basis of value chains and the vehicle for value realization as well as value addition. Value chains reflect value addition in each stage of an industrial chain. A corporate supply chain, once deployed on a global scale, becomes a global supply chain as the basis for the emergence of global industrial and value chains.
2.2 Necessity of the New Development Pattern: From a GVC Perspective The past three decades have seen great transformations in the nature of international trade.
Technological, institutional and political developments have enabled the global distribution of increasingly fragmented and scattered production processes. Countries specialize in various production processes and intermediate inputs, such as parts and components, under a global production network. This has prompted increased trade in intermediate inputs within a country or among nations, which accounts for close to 2/3 of global trade. Instances of trade in intermediate inputs are common in our economic life. Xing and Detert (2010) discovered from an anatomy of iPhone's value chain that value addition from assembly and processing in China accounted for less than 3.60 US dollars (3.60%) from each 100 US dollars' worth of an iPhone while the majority share of value addition was captured by Germany, Japan and the US. Such GVC division of labor is evident from high-tech products such as aircrafts, automobiles and iPods (Linden et al., 2009) to consumer necessities, Barbie dolls (Tempest, 1996) and sneakers.
These studies have been followed by improvements in the measurement of GVCs at the macro and micro levels. Having been widely applied in the trade sector, GVC theories and methods have been placed at the forefront of international trade research, about one third of the latest papers on international trade are related to GVCs (Inomata, 2017). Some scholars referred to the GVC theory as the New-NewNew trade theory. Some scholars argued that even if GVCs are not synonymous to international trade, they are typical manifestations of international trade (Park et al., 2013).
New developments in the global division of labor and international trade have led to the emergence of new theories and research methodologies for international trade (GVC accounting), which call for new development strategies.
Firstly, GVCs are a supply-side manifestation of domestic and international dual circulations. The mutual reinforcement between domestic and international circulations is reflected in the coordination, efficiency and security of domestic and international value chain operations. Featuring a chain or network structure comprising global R&D, manufacturing and marketing, GVCs consist of coordinated and efficient interactions between domestic and international value chains.
Secondly, GVC management concepts embody the new development pattern of "dual circulations" and its underlying concepts. The new development pattern of "dual circulations" marks a furtherance of the new development concept. In establishing a new development pattern, the key is to make concerted progress in innovative, balanced, green, open and shared development as aspects of the new development concept. As an integrated set of management philosophies and methodologies, the GVCs management strategy is underpinned by the core concepts of integration, cooperation, coordination and shared benefits. The supply chain management system encompasses product R&D and design, manufacturing and processing, transportation, distribution, and sales with the participation of various stakeholders, including manufacturers, suppliers, warehouse operators, distribution centers, and distributors. All those links are correlated with each other, and any missing step could cripple an entire supply chain. This is why GVCs management requires consolidation, cooperation and coordination for shared benefits, which

coincide with the new development concept. In fostering a new development pattern, China must rely on domestic circulation as the mainstay
if it is to climb up the value ladder, escape low-end lock-up, and enhance industrial competitiveness. Since reform and opening up was launched in 1978, China has taken an active part in the international circulation by vigorously developing processing trade, and made great economic achievements under an export-oriented economic growth model. In this process, China has continuously improved its industrial system and become a country with the most complete industrial sectors in the world, which includes all industrial sectors under the United Nations classification. Despite significant upgrades, China's industries remain at the mid- and low-end processes of the industrial chain and are vulnerable to trade restrictions by developed countries, which pose grave problems to China's supply chain security. Sanctions against Chinese companies like ZTE and Huawei have revealed that China cannot rely on foreign countries for critical technologies. With its massive domestic market, China should create a new development pattern with domestic circulation as the mainstay, promote demand-driven indigenous innovation, develop critical technologies, and climb up the value ladder.
3. Directions and Trends of GVCs Restructuring
The distribution of GVCs has always been subject to various factors with dynamic adjustment. So long as the economies of scale and comparative advantages exist, the COVID-19 pandemic will not reverse the regionalization of GVCs. In fact, this process has been accelerated by the political factor of a changing international order, the economic factor of market and technological changes and the security concerns of industrial chains.
3.1 Access to Economies of Scale and Comparative Advantages as the Base The economies of scale and comparative advantages determine the continuation and deepening
of cross-border division of labor. In different stages of development across countries, cross-border production will continue to contribute to the economies of scale and comparative advantages amid a changing international order, the digital economy, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
A changing international order affects the system of the intra-product division of labor but cannot shake the foundation of intra-product division of labor. By transforming the way production is organized, technology progress lays the foundation for the intra-product division of labor. With technology progress, geographically dispersed production generates sufficient economies of scale and comparative advantages. Since the second "unbundling" of globalization, the trends toward cross-border and fragmented production will not reverse with a changing international order. Led by the US with the participation of Canada and Mexico, a North America regional production network took shape as early as before the end of the Cold War. With the sophistication of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the end of the Cold War, the United States dominated a liberal international order, and East Asia began to participate in the global production network, which marks a regional dispersion of intra-product division of labor. Amid a changing international order, the only change is the system of intra-product division of labor rather than the reality of intra-product cross-border division of labor. Intra-product division of labor refers to the designation of participants in specific links of the division of labor at various geographical locations. The division of labor system stays in a state of dynamic adjustment.
Technology revolution will further deepen the intra-product division of labor and reduce the cost of transaction within and between production processes. The impact of technology revolution on the intra-product cross-border division of labor is investigated with the digital economy as an example. The digital economy has further reduced the cost of transaction between production processes. The digital economy comprises digital industrialization and industrial digitalization. While the former is new demand created by new supply and drives economic growth, the latter is focused on transforming

the way production is organized.2 Digital production further extends production beyond the boundary of firms and further refines the intra-product division of labor. However, digital production is essentially a means for lowering the cost of transaction and raising the efficiency of production. In this sense, digital production has similar effects on globalization compared with earlier information and communication technologies (ICTs), and the only difference lies in the magnitude of impact.
In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the economies of scale and comparative advantages in production continue to drive the intra-product cross-border division of labor. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is an industrial revolution spearheaded by artificial intelligence (AI), new materials, molecular engineering, graphene, virtual reality, quantum information technology, controlled nuclear fusion, clean energy, and biotechnology. This new round of industrial revolution is characterized by higher productivity, less pollution, changing ways of life, and flexibility and adaptability.3 The Fourth Industrial Revolution will vastly enhance productivity and transform the way production is organized. South Korea, Singapore, Germany, Japan and Denmark boast the highest levels of automation in the world, and fully participate in GVCs with relatively low cost of labor and high productivity.
3.2 Regionalization and Localization of GICs Since the cross-border intra-product division of labor will not change, the question of GVCs
restructuring becomes one that relates to the cross-border distribution or choice of location. The choice of production sites is subject to exogenous factors such as the international order and market, and the COVID-19 challenges to supply chain security are new factors of influence.
A changing international order is shaping the regional layout of GICs. In its major-power competition with China, the United States sought to decouple from China's industrial chains, thereby suppressing China's development through GVCs disruptions. The United States launched an attack against China in the high-tech sector, and on March 23, 2018, then US President Donald Trump placed tariffs on imports from China's aviation and aerospace, information and communications technology, and machinery sectors based on the results of a Section 301 investigation. Further restrictions were imposed against global investments from Chinese high-tech firms, targeting at China's high-tech exports. The United States also launched attacks on China's high-tech industrial chains. In March 2016 and April 2018, the United States issued injunctions prohibiting US high-tech firms from supplying components, software, equipment and other technological products to ZTE, a Chinese telecom manufacturer. These attacks not only stifled ZTE but weakened China's telecom industry chain. Since then, the United States has also put Huawei, a telecommunications equipment company, on its trade blacklist, prohibiting global suppliers with US technology from shipping goods to Huawei. As a result, Huawei's 5nm Kirin chip production came to a halt. Meanwhile, the US lobbied its trade partners to ban Huawei gear, forcing them to comply. The US attacks on China's high-tech sector will drive China to innovate and seek alternative suppliers from the high-tech industry chain.
Security considerations will lead to industrial chain regionalization and diversification. In many parts of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has halted production and impeded imports, setting the scene for industrial chain disruptions. Some countries have ceased to completely rely on cross-border production to protect their industrial chain security. For instance, the Japanese government considered relocating enterprises back to Japan to form independent and secure value chains under its control. Soon after the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, China provided medical supplies to countries around the world. Recognizing the health industry's importance to national security, then US President Donald Trump decided to relocate the health industry back to the US with the expectation to form an independent health industry. Yet history tells us that in the era of globalization, it appears unfeasible

for countries to move entire industrial chains back to their home soil for security considerations. The Fukushima nuclear accident led to a temporary crisis of global high-tech supply chains. However, Japan remains an important source for the supply of high-tech components globally, and security concerns did not lead high-tech firms from the US and Europe to diversify away from Japan on a mass scale. In a delicate balance between efficiency and security, efficiency gained the upper hand.
Regionalization and diversification are a compromise between efficiency and security. It is all but impractical for countries to move entire industrial chains back to their home turf. Large countries like China and the United States possess relatively complete industrial chains. Yet it goes against the principles of economies of scale and comparative advantage for them to build complete supply chains in their home soil. The very basis for global intra-product division of labor is the comparative advantages of countries for different production processes. On one hand, small countries with incomplete industrial systems are unlikely to forge complete industrial chains on their own. On the other hand, developing countries have managed to grow their economies based on factor cost advantage before completing industrialization. No matter for developed or developing countries, the creation of independent industrial chains is faced with a trade-off between cost imposition and industrial chain independence. It is inadvisable for developing countries to cope with rare and temporary supply chain crises at the expense of economic development. While leading nations seek to regionalize and diversify their supply chains, smaller countries continue to participate in industrial chain systems dominated by major countries.
With China's new comparative advantages of market heft and complete industrial sectors forged closer industrial chains in East Asia, and the COVID-19 pandemic has sped up the relocation of industrial chains to Asia. Market is a critical driver of industrial agglomeration. China has become a center of global industrial and supply chains partly because of its market opportunities for Asian countries. Since reform and opening up, China's economic strengths and external demand have been increased. Meanwhile, advanced economies have seen their domestic demand stagnate since the 1980s, especially after the global financial crisis of 2008, and supply chains started to concentrate in emerging markets. As can be seen from data in Table 1, major Asian economies (from economic rather than geographical perspective) exported more to China, Japan and South Korea combined than they did to the United States in 2019. While exports from Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to China, Japan and South Korea combined accounted for 0.308, 0.305, 0.242 and 0.239 of their total exports, respectively, exports from the same countries to the United States accounted for 0.232, 0.106, 0.097 and 0.127 of their total exports China and the United States accounted for similar shares of exports from Japan and Thailand. South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia exported significantly more to China than to the US. Vietnam exported much less to China than to the United States. The external markets of these Asian countries are in East Asia. China's comparative advantage in the manufacturing sector has evolved from low labor cost to a complete industrial system based on in-depth GVCs participation. With

laudable efforts in containing the COVID-19 pandemic, East Asia took the lead among the three global manufacturing networks to recover. Given China's large market and manufacturing prowess, East Asia's regional value chain connections will further strengthen. Well-functioning industrial and supply chains in East Asia will attract external investments that further boost East Asia's regional value chains and extend industrial chains outside the region. In this manner, East Asia will enhance its position as a global manufacturing hub and serve as a destination for an accelerating relocation of global industrial chains.
The regionalization and diversification of global industrial chains stem from the joint effects of international order, market size, security and efficiency. Foreseeably, global industrial chains and supply chains will relocate to East Asia at an accelerating pace.
3.3 New Pattern of the Global Economy Shaped by the Digital Economy In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), the manufacturing industry is increasingly influenced by
the transformative forces of AI. Focusing on core technologies, talents and standardization, leading nations are preparing to spearhead a new round of international technological and industrial competition. Digitalization and ICT applications are identified as top priorities for the smart development of the manufacturing industry and its industrial chains.
According to the White Paper on the Global Digital Economy: New Dawn of Recovery under the COVID-19 Pandemic(2021), published by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), in the year 2020, the global digital economy reached an aggregate output of 32.6 trillion US dollars, accounting for 43.7% of global GDP aggregate, and the digital economy generated a value addition worth 24.4 trillion US dollars. China's digital economy stood at 5.4 trillion US dollars, trailing only to the United States. Despite the widening gaps, it should be noted that China has made great achievements in the digital economy sector, which has breathed tremendous new momentum into China's economic development.
By gathering global participants, digital platforms increase the efficiency of cross-border search and coordination and allow small businesses to participate. By aggregating mass options, the e-commerce market increases the transparency of pricing and comparison and achieves cross-border flow of goods on a mass scale. The transfer of global business costs and risks and the rising importance of knowledge and intangible assets have increased the risks for fostering digital capabilities and labor skills. Production automation has reduced the value of labor cost arbitrage and made it possible for decisions to be made geographically close to customers. Firms may derive significant efficiency from new technologies of production and logistics, but they require end-to-end integration to unleash full potentials. In this manner, the digital economy is influencing the pattern of the global division of labor in all respects. According to the 2018 World Trade Report by the World Trade Organization (WTO) (2018), over half of global trade in services and over 12% of cross-border trade in goods have achieved digitalization. The WTO also forecasts that driven by digital technologies, global trade will add an additional two percentage points each year from 2016 to 2030 (Yang et al., 2020).
4. Current Status of and Problems in China's Industrial Chain Development
4.1 Evolution of China's Industrial Chain Layout China's industrial chain layout has experienced five stages of development (Hu, 2020). Stage 1 (1949-1964): Implementation of the 156 Projects. With aid from the former Soviet Union,
China carried out the "156 Projects", giving priority to heavy industries and national defense. The "156 Projects" were distributed in 17 provincial-level regions with the eastern, central, western and northeastern regions accounting for 2.73%, 24.84%, 28.10% and 44.33%, respectively. Most of Soviet aid went to the northeastern region with a solid industrial foundation.
Stage 2 (1965-1978): The Third-Front Movement. For national defense purpose, China launched

a massive campaign of military, industrial and transportation infrastructure construction in more than a dozen provinces in interior regions away from coastlines. The Third-Front regions added fixed assets worth 114.5 billion yuan, or 33.58% of national total. As a primary region for the Third-Front development, the western region accounted for 80.56% of total investment for the Third-Front Movement.
Stage 3 (1978-1998): The eastern coastal region took the first step of reform and opening up. In this stage, the eastern region as a share of China's total GDP increased from 43.56% to 52.67%, and industries concentrated in the eastern region.
Stage 4 (1999-2008): Balanced regional development. Since the late 20th century, the Chinese government has started to implement a balanced regional development strategy and successively implemented strategies to develop China's western region, revitalize the northeast, promote the rise of the central region, and guide industrial relocation to the central, western and northeastern regions.
Stage 5 (since 2008): Overseas industrial relocation. Since the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, excess domestic capacity and rising operating cost have prompted Chinese companies to invest overseas. The implementation of the going global strategy and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has facilitated the overseas relocation of China's industries.
4.2 Current Status of China's Industrial Chain Development
4.2.1 External circulation of China's industrial chain lost momentum Overall, trade dependency measures the reliance of China's industrial chains on external demand
and supply. Moreover, trade dependency is a crude indicator of the status of external circulation in China's industrial chains. Here, trade dependency is defined by total trade volume as a share of GDP and can be further decomposed into import dependency and export dependency. Overall, the external circulation of China's industrial chains experienced volatility in its status from 2000 to 2019, which soared at first before spirally decreasing. Specifically, the status of China's industrial external circulation increased swiftly in 2001-2006 after China's WTO entry before reaching its peak (64.48%) in 2006. From 2007 to 2009, China's trade dependency decreased sharply amid the global financial crisis. From 2010 to 2019, China's trade dependency brieflyrised due to a recovery in the global economy before steadily decreasing. In 2019, China's trade dependency stood at 35.68%, and the status of its external industrial circulation became less important compared with 2000. Export and import dependencies have shown similar trends with trade dependency, which is an indication that China's industrial chains have become dominated by the domestic circulation.

Figure 3: Share of the Secondary Industry for Various Provincial Jurisdictions in China in 2020
Source: Statistical communiqués for various provincial-level regions in 2020.

The past few decades have seen remarkable progress in China's industrial upgrade. As can be seen from Figure 3, most provinces have experienced an upgrade in their industrial structure, as manifested in a sharp decline in the share of their secondary industries and a rising share of the tertiary industry amid economic development. In 2020, various provinces within the same region shared similarities in their industrial structure. As can be seen from Figure 3, the secondary industry accounted for similar shares in the economy of provincial jurisdictions in North China except for Beijing, including Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia. In Eastern China except for Shanghai, the secondary industry accounted for similar shares in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Shandong provinces. In the central region, the secondary industry made up for similar shares in Henan, Hubei and Hunan provinces.
China's secondary industry is concentrated in the eastern coastal region and the central region. While eastern provinces continue to account for dominant shares of the secondary industry, there has been a slight trend of industrial relocation to the central and southwestern regions. As can be seen from Figure 4, Jiangsu and Guangdong provinces boast the highest shares of the secondary industry in national total, reaching 11.54% and 11.34%, respectively, and the percentage is even higher for Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi and Shandong in East China, Henan, Hubei and Hunan in Central China, and Sichuan in Southwest China. Judging by change in each province's secondary industry as a share of national total from 1998 to 2020 (Figure 5), Beijing, Hebei, Tianjin and Shanxi in North China and the northeast have seen the greatest decline in their shares of secondary industry. The share of secondary industry increased the most for Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces in East China, Henan, Hubei and Hunan in Central China, Sichuan, Chongqing and Guizhou in Southwest China, and Shaanxi in Northwest China.
4.3 Problems in China's Industrial Chains
4.3.1 Premature deindustrialization: China's manufacturing industry as a share of the economy declined The manufacturing industry best reflects a country's technological and economic strengths. About
80% of technology progress and innovation applications occur in the manufacturing industry, where progress in labor productivity is the most evident and can significantly boost economic development. The manufacturing industry also best embodies industrial chain division of labor. Given these traits, the current status of China's industrial chain development can be best analyzed with the manufacturing industry as an example. Despite great achievements in manufacturing development, China's manufacturing industry has accounted for a decreasing share of the economy. As can be seen from Figure 6,

China's manufacturing output has been steadily increasing since 2010, doubling from 13.0 trillion yuan in 2010 to 28.1 trillion yuan by 2019. However, China's manufacturing industry as a share of GDP has been on the decline, down from the peak of 31.90% in 2011 to 28.4% in 2019, and stayed above 28.00% for most of the time.
China is the world's leader in manufacturing value-added. In 2019, China's manufacturing valueadded accounted for 28.00% of the global manufacturing's total, exceeding the share of 17.00% for the United States. Compared with developed countries, China's manufacturing development remains at a low level. For instance, China ranks first in terms of the output of iron and steel, copper, cement, chemical fibers, shipbuilding, and automobiles. Yet, these industries have medium and low levels of technological intensity. China heavily relies on foreign countries for high-end chips, industrial software and advanced CNC machine tools.
Since 2013, China's urban employment growth rate started to decrease, and since 2014, manufacturing workforce has started to shrink at an accelerating pace. By 2019, China's manufacturing industry created close to 38.32 million urban jobs, down 8.92% from 2018. Private manufacturing enterprises and individual businesses created 59.08 million jobs, up only 2.28% from the manufacturing workforce in 2018. These figures indicate a decrease in the share of the manufacturing industry. With the deepening and evolving industrial division of labor, China's service-based manufacturing has expanded. Hence, the manufacturing industry as a share of the economy will experience a structural decrease under the traditional statistical approach. Before China joins the rank of high-income countries, policymakers should be cautious of a premature deindustrialization trap.
4.3.2 China's manufacturing industry at the low end of the value chain with a limited value addition Despite China's industrial movement towards mid- and high-end processes, China's overall
industrial value addition has yet to increase and trails far behind strong manufacturing nations. As the world's manufacturing floor, China's manufacturing industry initially focused on processing exports, which led to a huge surplus but also became locked up at low value production processes.
In 2017, China's manufacturing industry recorded a value-addition rate of 24.56%, and the manufacturing value-addition rates of the United States, Japan, Germany and the UK all exceeded 45%. Within the manufacturing sector, China's internationally competitive textile sector and communication devices, computers and other electronic equipment manufacturing sector generate far smaller value-

added compared with other major industrialized countries. In 2017, China's textile sector generated a value addition rate of 22.41%, and this figure was generally above 30.00% or even 40.00% for other leading industrialized countries. China's communication equipment, computers and other electronic device manufacturing sector had a value addition rate of merely 19.36%, which was somewhat higher than Mexico's (17.18%) and eclipsed by the US figure of 49.56%. Due to its relatively low product value addition rate, China did not fully realize the benefits of globalization. For example, in an analysis of iPad and iPhone's value composition conducted by McKinsey, it was reported that the cost of raw materials account for 31%; the cost of distribution and retail comprise 15%. From each iPad, Apple Corporation's profit represents 30%, and the cost of labor input in the Chinese mainland only equals 2%. For the iPhone, Apple Corporation's profit accounts for 58.5% of the sales price while the cost of labor input in the Chinese mainland only represents 1.8%.
4.3.3 Relying on foreign-controlled critical technologies Since reform and opening up was launched in 1978, China has achieved rapid economic
development based on its market heft, technology imitation, low-cost factor supply, among other comparative advantages. This path of development is a fast track for late-moving countries to overtake more advanced countries. Following this path of imitation, however, China has lost sight of the importance of fundamental industrial capabilities and remained at the mid- and low-end processes of industrial value chains. Its high-end industries are underdeveloped and heavily dependent on foreign technologies. China has yet to increase product premiumization, standardization, and reliability. Weak industrial fundamentals have been the biggest hurdle to China's industrial development. China has yet to develop complete fundamental service systems such as econometrics, standardization, certification, and information services, and lessen its dependence on overseas supplies of fundamental software, operating system, and algorithms.
In 2018, the Science and Technology Daily listed 35 critical technologies that China relied on foreign supplies and measured China's gaps with foreign suppliers. These critical technologies were controlled by developed countries led by the US, the EU and Japan. China's self-sufficiency for critical components, materials and devices was only one third. Advanced CNC machine tools, chips, lithography machines, and sensors were subject to foreign technological monopoly. In those sectors, China had yet to achieve technological breakthrough. According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT)4 for more than 30 large enterprises, out of 130 types of critical basic

materials, the surveyed enterprises had no domestic suppliers for 32.00% of critical materials, relied on imports for 52.00% of critical materials, and had to import 95.00% high-end chips, over 70% smart processors, and most memory chips. Currently, China's weak industrial foundation is manifested in a lack of chips, processors, and fundamentals across many industries.
5. China's Strengths for Industrial Chain Upgrade
Since reform and opening up was initiated in 1978, China has actively integrated into GVCs. Since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, China has adjusted its policies to come to terms with international trade rules. By broadening openness, scaling down the negative list, and offering a conducive business climate, China has emerged as an attractive destination for multinational firms to set up factories and R&D centers, becoming the world's factory floor. China became the world's largest goods exporting nation in 2009 and the world's largest manufacturing nation in 2010. By the end of 2019, China's manufacturing value-added reached 3,901.96 billion US dollars, accounting for 27.20% of China's GDP. Since the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, China has contributed more than 30% of world economic growth and integrated into core processes of GVCs as a key participant.
5.1 Large Industrial Volumes and Complete Industrial Chains In embedding into value chains, China's manufacturing industry has ascended the GVC ladder and
formed incomparable industrial chains. After years of independent development, China has formed the longest, largest and relatively complete industrial chains. According to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, China is the only country with all manufacturing sectors and ranks high in the world in terms of the value-added of 22 manufacturing sectors. China ranks the first in terms of output of 230 out of 500 types of major industrial goods in the world. A complete modern industrial system ensures China's economic resiliency, allowing China to effectively maintain industrial and supply chain stability despite external shocks beyond its control.
5.2 New Comparative Advantages Are Taking Shape China's traditional advantages for resource endowment, such as labor cost and demographic
dividends, have diminished in recent years. However, China's new comparative advantages are emerging. In terms of production inputs, China's cost advantage for primary production factors, especially cheap labor, is giving way to strengths in advanced production factors such as digital technology. In the decade following the global financial crisis of 2008, China's manufacturing compensation per worker rose from 4,915 US dollars in 2009 to 9,061 US dollars in 2018. This 7% annual average growth rate exceeded not only the world average by close to six percentage points, but the growth rates of India, Indonesia and Mexico. As mentioned before, China has the second largest digital economy in the world. By integrating with the real economy, the digital economy will undoubtedly become a new cornerstone for China's manufacturing competitiveness.
In terms of technological innovations, China's exogenous innovation dividend based on technology transfer from the developed world is giving way to endogenous innovation supported by a large domestic economy. Since reform and opening up was launched in 1978, China has established a relatively complete innovation system through industrial transfer, technology importation, assimilation, integrated innovation, and strategic emulation. The problem is that multinational firms tend to retain core technologies in their home soil and transfer mature technologies to host countries. Their R&D in host countries is focused on adaptations to the local market needs. The dividends of such technology transfer have been more or less exhausted. China's large and multitiered market offers a broad and inclusive environment for businesses to thrive, giving rise to endogenous innovation led by independent, coordinated and integrated innovations.
In terms of the domestic market environment, China's strengths in consumer market, brand

awareness and development opportunities give rise to purchaser-driven GVC champions. China is home to the world's largest middle-income group with a broad and diverse domestic consumer market. An ultra-large market is China's new comparative advantage. Market potentials underpin China's economic stability and welfare improvement. Market heft is the basis for China to cope with socio-economic risks and challenges and maintain industrial and supply chain stability. China has made great improvements in industrial services and business climate. Modern services have expedited high-end and flexible servicebased manufacturing development. For instance, telemedicine requires low-latency 5G network gear and AR devices; culture and entertainment services also require digital devices that enable digital features.
6. Policy Implications
Barriers to Global Supply chains stem from the short-term shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic. The current priority for China is to stabilize GICs and ensure GICs security. Amid the pandemic, China-US competition has escalated. Early preparations should be made for GICs regionalization as a long-term trend.
6.1 Enhancing Fundamental Manufacturing Capabilities and Industrial Chain Modernization Based on China's Ultra-Large Market
As the world today experiences changes unseen in a century, China should strive to improve fundamental industrial capabilities and industrial chains as part of its new development pattern characterized by domestic economic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. A new round of great transformations is sweeping across the world today. Amid in-depth adjustments in the international economic and political order, uncertainties and instabilities are on the rise.
In addition, China already has the basic conditions for domestic economic circulation. It has a large and diverse domestic consumer market and the world's largest middle-income group. Yet, the supply side of China's consumer market lacks sophistication compared with the international consumer market. Domestic demand for mid- and high-end goods and services has yet to be effectively satisfied by domestic supplies. China should propel household consumption upgrade from the supply side, increase the effective supply of goods and services in its mid- and high-end and emerging consumer markets, and vigorously introduce high-quality goods and services from the international market (Ni and Ji, 2020). From a supply-side perspective, China boasts the largest and most complete industrial system, and the economic foundation for the domestic circulation to play a dominant role. Under the new development pattern, as pointed out by Huang (2020), "we should enhance the reliance of GVCs on China while expanding opening up and bolstering domestic circulation. This calls for stronger manufacturing and industrial chain capabilities."
6.2 Enhancing Manufacturing Competitiveness and Prevent Industrial Chain Relocation in the Window Period of Pandemic Control
With its shocks to the world economy, the COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed GVC restructuring. China's success in pandemic control and economic recovery have won a window period to take an initiative in GVC restructuring. To some extent, the pandemic has slowed the migration of China's labor-intensive manufacturing to Southeast Asia. Amid rising factor cost and trade protectionism, China's industrial and supply chains have started to relocate elsewhere. The pandemic alarmed the developed world of the importance of supply chain security. Countries have vowed to re-shore strategic industries such as medical supplies and critical materials and localize the manufacturing of critical products. Yet those attempts to re-shore supply chains have been marred by the pandemic, thus delaying manufacturing relocation from China. This creates a rare window period for China to stabilize and upgrade its manufacturing industrial chains. China should take this opportunity to ramp up R&D, build up manufacturing competitiveness, and curb manufacturing relocation. It should seize this period of

98
"supply vacuum" facing developed countries gripped by the pandemic, strengthen traditional export advantages, support firms to explore the international market, and serve as a destination for the transfer of international orders.
With powerful, stable and resilient supply chains, China's economy swiftly recovered from the pandemic, providing a vital force for global supply chain operations. China's supply chain stability has become a key attraction to global capital backflows. Following this trend, China should enhance capabilities for central and western regions to serve as destinations for industrial relocation, create a group of world-class industrial zones, and combine the central and western regions' factor strengths, such as raw materials, land and energy, with the eastern region's strengths in capital and technology. The goal is to establish a domestic division of labor system with reasonable echelons, close ties and efficient coordination. While stabilizing domestic industrial chains, China should strive to bring industries back home, optimize industrial layout, and establish high-quality modern industrial clusters. China should stabilize manufacturing supply chains and prevent manufacturing relocation, focusing on key enterprises and processes of GICs. Firstly, we should establish core industrial zones led by key enterprises and encourage them to set up regional headquarters, R&D centers, and settlement centers. Secondly, we should step up business promotion, strengthen supply chains, develop industrial ecosystems, and foster "implicit champions" and "niche champions" that lead global or nationwide markets. Thirdly, we should reduce the cost of transaction for the division of labor among enterprises within individual clusters by leveraging the economies of scale and intensive operations. Enterprises within an industrial cluster should forge alliances to increase their bargaining power with upstream and downstream enterprises.
6.3 Developing Complete Domestic Industrial Chains and Regional Value Chains The United States, Germany, Japan and China lie at the heart of GVCs, and peripheral countries
become actively embedded into core value chains, forming regional value chains in North America, Europe and Asia. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, economic decoupling between China and the US is likely to accelerate, and the depth of China's participation in GVCs may decrease. This requires China to proactively foster and develop domestic and regional value chains. After the pandemic, GVC restructuring will accelerate. Leveraging its window period of an early economic recovery, China should deepen cooperation with GVCs and enhance its capabilities to coordinate, control and dominate future regional and global supply chain networks.
China should step up industrial chain cooperation with neighboring regions and important countries involved in the BRI, strengthen ties with the industrial and supply chains of the European Union, Japan and South Korea, and take the initiative in the new round of GVC restructuring through "China+X" industrial chains under the BRI. In addition, China should localize and diversify its supply chains. A national supply chain strategy and supply chain local substitution initiative should be implemented. In critical areas, upstream and downstream enterprises of domestic industrial chains should work together to create independent, secure and reliable domestic supply chain systems. China should strive to substitute high-value imported commodities with domestic replacements via R&D and product upgrades. For products for which no domestic substitute can be found, China should seek new suppliers from the international market, diversify supply chains, and win more time for breakthroughs to be made in critical technologies.
Priority should be given to enhancing the East Asian regional value chain and developing the BRI regional value chain. On the one hand, it is suggested to develop a regional value chain system led by China in East Asia. With their export-oriented policies, East Asian economies have established a mature division of labor system during the rapid expansion of globalization. With a large market, China may scale up investments in East Asia under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership RECP rules for trade and investment facilitation, enhance economic interdependence with East Asia, and create and lead a regional industrial chain network. On the other hand, proactive efforts should be made to develop

the BRI and establish industrial ties with European countries and minimize the adverse impact of US decoupling from China's high-tech sector.
6.4 Creating a Top-Down Mechanism for Domestic Industrial Relocation to Central and Western Regions In serving as a destination for industrial relocation, China's central and western regions are faced
with numerous challenges. While some are structural challenges stemming from national economic trends, others can be overcome by improving supporting industrial capabilities, business climate, and innovation factors such as professionals at the national and local levels. Institutional problems and challenges from the international environment can be addressed at the national level.
Firstly, China should breathe new momentum into policy-making incentral and western regions. A new mechanism of cross-regional land requisition and compensation balance should be put into place, allowing land quotas to be transferred between eastern and central and western regions and cities within the same province. Credit issuance should be increased to industries that meet national industrial policies and energy conservation and environmental protection requirements. Preferential reserve ratio requirement and relending policy should be given to central and western provinces receiving relocating industries. Preferential local tax rates should be granted to central and western regions. Fiscal transfer payments should be ramped up to central and western regions. Tax breaks should be granted to major infrastructure, industrial, high-tech, and exporting projects in line with national industrial policies.
Secondly, China should speed up the development of new special economic zones in the central and western regions. Unlike the balanced approach of establishing one national strategic economic zone in one province, we should create a group of new special economic zones in regional central cities of the central and western regions. In those special zones, we should implement integrated reform and policy measures, tolerate trials and errors, and offer more preferential policy incentives, tax breaks and customs arrangements referencing the policy practices of Southeast Asian countries for serving as destinations for industrial relocation. The special economic zones should be encouraged to attract populations and technologies and increase industrial capacity.
Thirdly, a top-down mechanism should be established to facilitate domestic industrial relocation. China should set up a steering group for industrial relocation to China's central and western regions responsible for the policy-making, planning and supervision of industrial relocation. China should formulate a plan for industrial relocation to central and western regions and identify priorities to avoid disorderly competition and repetitive development. The central and western regions should host a group of world-class industrial projects to facilitate industrial clustering. A special fund of industrial relocation should be established to support local governments or enterprises to relocate industries. Provinces in central and western regions should be paired with tier-one cities in the eastern region, so that cities with GDP above 1 trillion yuan in China's eastern coastal region will assist sister central cities in the central and western regions. Priority should also be given to achieving seamless infrastructure connectivity and grid-based major infrastructure development. Inappropriate policy measures should be corrected under a supervision and evaluation mechanism for industrial relocation.

SUMMARY
Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic is an extraordinary challenge for all countries and affects the psychological wellbeing of healthcare professionals working with people suffering from COVID-19 and puts them at a high risk of mental health problems. The aim of the study was to identify stress-related factors that affect the mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine.
Subjects and methods: A total of 1098 Ukrainian healthcare workers were surveyed using an online questionnaire consisting of questions relating to a) socio-demographic characteristics; b) perceptions of the COVID-19 related situation; and c) stress and protective factors. Respondents were divided into two groups, depending on whether they pr ovided care to the patients with COVID-19 or not.
Results: Of the 1087 healthcare workers, 863 (79.4%) were found to have anxiety / fear caused by the COVID-19. No significant difference was detected between professionals who did and did not provide personal assistance to patients with COVID-19 concerning anxiety / fear related to COVID-19 (p=%DVHGRQORJLVWLFUHJUHVVLRQPRGHO2(6)=263.70, p=0.000) the most significant predictive factors for anxiety / fear caused by the COVID-19 were factors related to safety and risk perception (the risk of getting infected, dying, infecting loved ones, perception of the threat of the epidemic spread), information factors (constant news about COVID-19), as well as factors related to the organisation of care (lack of staff in health care facilities).
Conclusions: Negative risk perception, high consumption of COVID-19 news, and shortage of staff in health care facilities were significant predictors of anxiety / fear caused by the COVID-19.
Key words: COVID-19 - mental health - healthcare workers - anxiety - stress

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has become an immense challenge for healthcare workers worldwide (Mehta et al. 2021, Baud et al. 2020). The new virus has had a profound effect on the psychological wellbeing of healthcare employees working on the front-line, placing them at a high risk of mental health problems (Cabarkapa et al. 2020). Disastrous outcomes such as burnout, insomnia, distress, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depressive symptoms have been reported among healthcare workers treating patients with COVID-19 (Lai et al. 2020, Pappa et al. 2020, Carmassi et al. 2020, Giusti et al. 2020, Azoulay et al. 2020, Pinchuk et al. 2021). According to previous pandemic experience, mental health disorders have been reported even after the end of an outbreak, suggesting long-term implications (Mak 2009, Lancee 2008).
There is a growing number of reports indicating increased stress among health workers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (Sanghera et al. 2020, Chen et al. 2020, Chung & Yeung 2020). Thus, stress symptoms are observed not only among healthcare

staff directly dealing with COVID-19 patients, but also among those who are not on the frontline (Vizheh et al. 2020). It is worth mentioning that lockdown along with strict biosecurity measures during the COVID-19 pandemic turned out to be powerful stress factors for healthcare workers, including increased workloads, decreased access to social support, lack of information about COVID-19, fear of infecting friends and family (Koh 2020).
Risk factors increasing the vicarious traumatization in healthcare workers include young age, female gender, as well as absence of social support, isolation, stigmatisation, large amounts of work, nursing, lower level of specialised training, and lack of work experience (Li et al. 2020). Furthermore, the following factors reduce the negative impact of an epidemic on the mental health of medical personnel: a warm and friendly atmosphere at work, improving the health status of infected colleagues; stopping the spread of infection among medical staff; organisation of coordinated and flexible work of all departments in the institution; previous professional experience; high level of commitment to professional ethics and integrity (Duan & Zhu 2020).

The aim of this study was to identify stress-related socio-psychological factors that affect the mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study Design
A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted from 04.10.2020 until 05.11.2020. Data were gathered from an online questionnaire.
Study Sample
The survey of 1098 healthcare workers across Ukraine was conducted using a specially developed online questionnaire.
Data Collection Tool
For the study, a self-administered online questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire was created based on the experience and results of a survey conducted during the SARS epidemic in 2003 by I. Khalid and colleagues (Khalid et al. 2016). The questionnaire consisted of 4 sections. The first 10 questions focused on socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents, the remaining 37 questions were grouped into 3 blocks of factors associated with COVID-19 stress: 1) perceptions about COVID-19 related situations; 2) stress factors; 3) protective factors. However, not all respondents provided complete answers to all groups of questions, thus the absolute values for individual categories of questions ranged from 1039 to 1087.
Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to illustrate socioGHPRJUDSKLF LQGLFDWRUV 3HDUVRQ V FULWHULRQ  ZDV applied to compare group differences in categorical variables (socio-demographic characteristics). The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the severity of each stress factor in the groups of respondents. A p<0.05 value was considered statistically significant. Logistic regression analysis was utilized for the classification and prediction of anxiety and fear related to COVID-19 in healthcare workers based on stress factors obtained in the testing groups of respondents. Odds ratio and 95% CI, and p-values of the Wald test for each independent variable were reported. According to the logistic model, an operating characteristic curve (ROC) was created, an area under the ROC curve (AUC), and the corresponding cut points were displayed. The diagnostic value of stress factors for anxiety was evaluated. The results of the study were processed using the statistical package of the licensed program TIBCO Statistica 13.4 (Lavrakas et al. 2019).

Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate
All procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and the national research committees as well as with The Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and its amendments or comparable ethical standards. As the participation in the study was voluntary and the study was conducted without any intervention, meaning that it involved no more than minimal risk, the Research Ethics Committee approved that informed consent was provided immediately preceding the respondents completing the questionnaire.
RESULTS
Among the 1087 respondents, the majority were female healthcare workers 870 (80.1%). The most represented age categories of healthcare workers were from 41 to 50 years - 280 (25.8%), 31-40 years - 262 (24.1%), and over 60 years 250 (23%). Fewer respondents were aged under 30 - 178 (16.4%) and from 51 to 60 - 117 (10.8%).
Most of the participants in the online survey were employees of primary healthcare centres - 198 (18.2%) and family medicine clinics - 143 (13.2%). A large number of subjects represented inpatient medical institutions (37.3%): central district hospitals - 137 (12.6%), city multidisciplinary hospitals - 135 (12.4%) and regional hospitals - 134 (12.3%). The rest of the physicians - 340 (31.3%) were from other healthcare institutions.
The majority of the healthcare workers were from outpatient clinics - 202 (18.6%), psychiatry 137 (12.6%), and therapeutic departments - 129 (11.9%). The representation of medical staff from other medical departments (pediatrics, intensive care unit, surgical, LQIHFWLRXVWKHU) ranged from 1.9% to 5.2%.
More than half of respondents were doctors - 630 (58.0%). Chiefs of departments - 157 (14.4%) and nurses - 143 (13.2%) also participated in the study, followed by 31 clinic chiefs (2.9%) and 126 (11.6%) professionals in other occupation positions.
Approximately every fifth surveyed healthcare professional was a family doctor (n=229 /21.0%). The number of psychiatrists and therapists was also relatively high, 172 (15.8%) and 113 (10.4%), respectively. At the same time, the participation of representatives of other medical specialties (pediatrics, intensive care medicine, cardiology, surgery, infectious diseases, obstetrics and gynecology, addiction, e.t.c.) ranged from 1.0% to 6.4%.
Regarding the marital status of the medical staff, at the time of the survey, more than two-thirds of them were married - 736 (67.7%), 186 (17.1%) - unmarried, 126 (11.6%) were divorced, another 39 (3.2%) were widows or widowers. More than half of the respondents had children - 670 (61.6%). The majority of the surveyed healthcare workers were living with a husband / wife - 698 (64.2%), 101 (8.5%) - with their parents, the remaining 213 (19.6%) ± alone.

All respondents' answers were divided into two groups, depending on whether they provided care to patients with COVID-19 directly (group A, n=639) or were indirectly involved in the treatment process (group B, n=448). Thus, direct medical care for patients with COVID-19 was provided by 58.8% of the specialists who participated in the survey.
We relate the personal involvement in dealing with COVID-19 patients by healthcare workers with a range of socio-demographic indicators.
The results of the study suggest that the age of healthcare workers may affect the delivery of personal care to patients with COVID-19 (p=0.0027). In the age groups up to 30 years, from 31 to 40 and from 41 to 50 years, there were significantly more specialists who provided personal assistance to patients with COVID19, compared to those who did not. Among specialists over the age after 50, the number of respondents who did and did not provide personal assistance was relatively equal.
Regarding the gender of the staff, no difference was found between those who provided personal care to patients with COVID-19 and those who did not (p=0.3163).
Marital status of a specialist was found to affect the care delivered to patients with COVID-19 (p=0.0321). Widowers and divorced professionals dealt with COVID-19 patients in relatively equal numbers, while married professionals provided care in the majority of cases. The most pronounced difference in rates was observed in the group of single respondents, only 32% of whom did not deliver personal care to patients with COVID-19 (Table 1).

The results of the study showed that the profile orientation of the department influenced the provision of personal care to patients with COVID-19 by specialists. Thus, most professionals from intensive care units, outpatient, therapeutic department, and pediatrics gave personal care to patients with COVID-19. A relative majority of surgical specialists (54%) also provided personal assistance to those with COVID-19. To a lesser extent, personal care was delivered by specialists from the psychiatric department (35%), administrative (42%), and other departments (26%).

Almost all specialists in infectious disease departments provided personal assistance to patients with COVID19 (p<0.0001).
Significant differences between groups A and B were found for a number of studied stress-associated factors (Table 2, Figure 1). Specialists who provided personal assistance perceived the risk of personal infection and the threat of pandemic spread to be more pronounced. They were more confident in the willingness of the health care institution to provide assistance to patients with COVID-19, as opposed to specialists who did not provide personal care (p<0.01). According to the types of response to the COVID-19 related situation, specialists who did not provide personal assistance to patients with COVID-19 were more likely to quit their jobs or get sick leave, to feel that others were avoiding them because of their possible contact with COVID-19 (p<0.01). Professionals who provided personal assistance were more distressed due to their increased workload compared to employees who did not work with COVID-19. Regarding the stress factors, healthcare professionals who did not provide personal assistance were experiencing more profound stress due to the possibility of transmitting COVID-19 to their relatives and felt a potential conflict between duty and personal safety (p<0.01). They, unlike those who provided care to people with COVID-19, were less likely to experience stress due to physical exhaustion or fatigue, difficulty to get to work, and absence / insufficiency of personal protective equipment. Regarding the protective factors, the absence of COVID-19 infection among the staff was more important for the specialists who provided personal care to patients with COVID-19 compared to those who did not (p<0.01). No significant difference between both groups of respondents was found concerning the other studied factors that might influence personal care delivery to patients with COVID-19 (p>0.05).

Psycho-affective response in the form of anxiety / fear caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was detected in 863 healthcare workers (79.4%), 224 (20.6%) declared absence of such manifestations. It is noteworthy that no significant difference was detected between professionals of both groups concerning anxiety / fear related to COVID-19 (p=0.0776). To identify the association between the 36 independent variables, which determined stress / protective factors and feelings of anxiety / fear related to COVID-19 in healthcare workers, logistic regression was used. Logistic regression allowed us to select significant predictive factors and build a final best predictive model (Table 3). As a result of an iterative process, the best logistic regression model based on 6 independent predictors was chosen 2(6)=263.70, p=0.000). The following 6 parameters were included in the logistic regression model:
 The threat of a COVID-19 pandemic spread.
 Risk of death from COVID-19.

 The risk of getting COVID-19.
 Probability of transmitting COVID-19 to relatives or friends.
 Constant news of new cases of COVID-19.
 Lack of staff in healthcare facilities.
It is noteworthy that the higher value of the Wald statistics determined the higher significance of the corresponding predictor for risk of anxiety. ROC analysis has been used to assess the sensitivity and specificity of predictors for the absence and presence of anxiety (Figure 1). Since AUC >0.8, we could identify that the model had a high predictive power. According to the results of the model for classifying healthcare workers who experienced (yes) or not the feeling of anxiety / fear related to COVID-19, the model predicted correctly in 60.5% (not) cases and 94.1% (yes) cases, and incorrectly in 39.5% (not) cases 5.9% (yes) cases.

DISCUSSION
The results of the study are in line with the results of other international publications on the effect of COVID19 on the mental health state of healthcare workers (Pappa et al. 2020, Sanghera et al. 2020, Vizheh et al. 2020).
Thus, 79.4% of medical workers in Ukraine experience stress and anxiety associated with COVID-19, and this does not depend on whether they provide direct care to patients with COVID-19 or not. However, it should be noted that this study did not involve measuring the clinical level of symptoms of anxiety and stress, and it may turn out to be different for the abovementioned groups.
The stress of professionals who provide care for people with COVID-19 is influenced by increased workload, exhaustion and fatigue, difficulty getting to work, and lack of protective equipment. At the same time, professionals who do not directly provide care to patients with COVID-19 are more worried about the possibility of transmitting COVID-19 to the relatives and have potential conflict between duty and personal safety. They are also more likely to quit their jobs or get sick leave and are more worried about avoiding them in the community because of their possible contact with coronavirus. Thus, while healthcare professionals who provide care for COVID-19 patients are an obvious risk group that deserves special attention, healthcare workers who are not involved in care for people with COVID-19 also experience significant stress and need support. These findings correspond with previous research (Vizheh et al. 2020), highlighting the need in development of broad support systems for healthcare professionals.
The most significant protective factor in our study was the absence of COVID-19 infection among the staff, which was more important for the specialists who provided personal care to patients with COVID-19 compared to those who did not. According to other researchers (Monistrol-Mula et al. 2022, Theofilidis et al. 2021, Labrague & de los Santos 2020) protective factors also might include organisational support; social support; and personal factors, like values and beliefs, adaptability/ flexibility, experience, and self-esteem/self-efficacy. Therefore, support programs should address different levels of factors to enhance resinience in healthcare workers.
Predictive factors for stress and anxiety associated with COVID-19 are factors related to safety and risk perception (the risk of getting infected, dying, infecting loved ones, perception of the threat of the epidemic spread), information factors (constant news about COVID-19), as well as factors related to the organisation of care (lack of staff in health care facilities). Thus, ensuring the safety, proper informing of staff, and appropriate organisation of the facility work can affect the level of anxiety and stress of health care workers associated with COVID-19. This information can be used to design further programs to promote the mental health and well-being of healthcare professionals, such as selfcare programs (Nawaz et al. 2020) or recomme-

dations for healthcare facilities on work policies and organisation (Hamouche 2021).
This study has a certain number of limitations. Firstly, it refers to the cross-sectional design of the study and the absence of follow-up. Secondly, the chain-referral sampling initiated in social networks among medical professionals may not be representative of the general population. Thirdly, the questionnaire was fulfilled only by medical workers who had access and competencies to fulfill online questionnaire.
CONCLUSION
This study proves that the mental health of healthcare workers in the context of overcoming the COVID19 pandemic requires particular attention and further investigation not only concerning the stress-related risk factors, but also their long-term effect to ensure the wellbeing of health care professionals and efficacy of heath care delivery.
According to our findings, fear and anxiety related to COVID-19 were regarded of significant importance for both healthcare professionals who did and did not provide care to patients with coronavirus infection. Among the factors that determined the risk of fear and anxiety associated with COVID-19 in all healthcare workers, the risk of getting infected by COVID-19 took the first place. Both factors that cause occupational stress and those that influence coping with it impact personal care delivery to patients with COVID-19 by healthcare professionals in an individual manner. The data obtained in this study provide a strong necessity for the development and implementation of preventive and rehabilitation measures, aimed at stabilization of the psycho-emotional state of healthcare professionals and improve the quality of medical assistance.

SUMMARY
Background: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) experience significantly higher prevalence of other mental disorders, which amplifies their need for overall support. The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in restrictions and limited access to different services with great challenge for families and children with ASD.
Subjects and methods: We used an electronic SurveyMonkey questionnaire to examine the experiences of 114 caregivers of FKLOGUHQ ZLWK $6' :H FRPSDUHG D OHYHO RI VXSSRUW E\ WKH FKLOG¶V VFKRRO FKDQJHV LQ FKLOG EHKDYLRU DQG SULRULW\ QHHGV IRU families of ASD and ASD with comorbidities (ASD+) children, during pandemic, and (b) developmental history and diagnosis for ASD and ASD+ children before the pandemic.
Results: Our research shows significant behavioral difficulties in the population with ASD and ASD+ that arose in the field of altered living conditions and overall functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistically significant results comparing ASD to ASD+ children we found in area of getting additional help and support before the outbreak of the pandemic (47.1% vs 16.0%, p=0.002), as well as in worsening of sleep problems, statistically significant more common in children with ASD+ (ASD+ 47.7% vs. ASD 25.7%, p=0.046).
Conclusions: Our findings can contribute to the faster development and implementation of protocols for dealing with situations such as pandemics, related to the vulnerable population of children with ASD and their caregivers.

INTRODUCTION
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social communication deficits, restricted interests, repetitive behaviors, and with an estimated global prevalence of 1% (APA 2013). It is a complex condition that significantly affects everyday life as well as the quality of life of the patient himself and that of his/her caregiver. Symptomatology that is often a presentation of comorbid state is very often misunderstood in everyday clinical practice as part of ASD clinical presentation. Individuals with ASD commonly experience significantly higher prevalence of other mental disorders compared to typically developed individuals (Romero et al. 2016). These comorbidities often exacerbate their need for overall support. It is generally considered that persons with comorbidity will have more severe impairments as a result of having more than one disorder (De Filippis 2018). It is estimated that nearly 70% of people diagnosed with ASD have at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder, and approximately 40% of them may have two or more

comorbid psychiatric disorders (Hossain et al. 2020). Common comorbidities in individuals with ASD are Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), mood alterations, sleeping and eating problems, mental retardation, behavioral problems, anxiety disorders, etc. (Lai et al. 2019). ASD continues to remain underdiagnosed in many countries (Elsabbagh et al. 2012). Serbia still does not have a national register of people with ASD8VLQJWKHVRFDOOHG³SURWHFWLYHGLDJQRVLV´LV common, avoiding the real, lifetime diagnosis of ASD. 0RUHRYHU ³JROG VWDQGDUG´ GLDJQRVWLF DVVHVVPHQW instruments, are rarely used, resulting in an inaccurate estimate of people diagnosed with ASD, which also includes the comorbid conditions (Lakic 2012, Stupar et al. 2015). The lack of exact diagnostic assessment hinders proper treatment, support, and total functioning improvement (Nik Adib et al. 2019). High functioning cases of ASD are often missed and they have been DVVHVVHGDV ³QRUPDOGHYHORSPHQW´IRUD ORQJSHULRGRI time (Elsabbagh et al. 2012). Therefore, it is logical to presume that individuals diagnosed with ASD are those with more severe and less functional forms of the

disorder. It can also be expected that their caregivers could have a higher level of stress and experience lack of social support (Elder et al. 2017).
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has resulted in drastic change of usual life style (Pfefferbaum & North 2020). The disease itself is characterized by a large spectrum of symptoms, high virulence and still an insufficiently predictable course (Chopra et al. 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many restrictions and limitations into everyday life, restrictions designed to protect the general population and prevent occurrence of the disease (Yuki et al. 2020). Pandemics are not unheard of in human history, however there is VWLOOOLWWOHH[SHULHQFHLQPDQDJLQJWKHSDQGHPLFV¶HIIHFWV on mental health and wellbeing (Guner 2020). COVID19 restrictions and limited access to different services have already been a great challenge for families with children and adults diagnosed with ASD.
Research on COVID-19 can inform the rapidly evolving knowledge base and identify strategies for developing resources to help families affected by ASD in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (Victor & Ahmed 2019, Colizzi et al. 2020). To this end, a primary step is to understand the needs of individuals affected by ASD as well as the needs of their caregivers.
The aim of this study was to compare: a) level of VXSSRUWE\WKHFKLOG¶VVFKRROFKDQJHVLQFKLOGEHhavior, and priority needs for families of children with ASD and ASD with comorbidities (ASD+) during pandemic, and b) developmental history and diagnosis for ASD and ASD+ children before the pandemic.
We want to engage knowledge in supporting diverse individuals and communities affected by neurodevelopmental disorders.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The Survey
Participants completed an electronic SurveyMonkey questionnaire developed by the Research Team from McGill University, Montreal, Canada. The survey was developed and pilot-tested with parents of children with neurodevelopmental conditions and was specifically designed to document the experiences of caregivers and/or parents of children (of all ages) with a neurodevelopmental condition before and during the pandemic. Survey questions were based on COVID-19 policy guidance recommendations for persons with disabilities and included topics such as response to the pandemic, access to care, and barriers and facilitators to keeping safe.
The questionnaire was translated from English to Serbian, independently by two researchers. The translations were then compared and combined. After this phase, back translation was performed by an independent consultant from the McGill University Research Team. The final Serbian questionnaire contained 149 of questions in 15 of sections and was designed to be completed in 20-30 minutes

(link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Za1DmF18g7MGr U2NtPfWh4VYcVAwq38G57r4aZ-ykNc/edit#responses).
Procedure
Caregivers of children with ASD were invited to participate in this study. The databases used to recruit participants belong to the child psychiatrist on the team as well as the parent association (NGOs) and specialized schools with whom we partnered. An email with the link to the survey was sent to parents and caregivers in the databases. The email included a brief explanation of the survey and its purpose. Participants were asked to forward the survey link to other caregivers of children diagnosed with ASD. Clicking the link automatically opened the survey. Data were collected from September to November 2020.
Participants
The survey was completed by 114 participants (parents and caregivers), 70 of which have children with an ASD only diagnosis, and 44 have children with ASD with some comorbid condition, disorder or disease (ASD+).
Statistical analysis
The data are presented in the form of arithmetic mean and standard deviation, i.e. in the form of absolute and relative numbers. The comparison of continuous values was performed by the t-test, and the comparison of categorical variables by the Chi-square test. We used a significance threshold of p<0.05. Statistical data processing was done in the software package R.
Ethics
The study procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approvals of the Ethical Committee of the Clinical Center of Nis, Serbia and McGill University, Montreal, Canada. All participants were informed about the study and all provided informed consent via an online system.
RESULTS
The survey was completed by 114 participants. They were caregivers of 70 individuals with ASD diagnosis (ASD), and 44 with ASD and comorbidities (ASD+). Most participants were women (80.0% in the group with ASD and 84.1% in the group with ASD+), average age  \HDUV ELRORJLFDO SDUHQWV  RI $6' individuals 95.4% of ASD+). Over half indicated having completed higher education (69.0% ASD and 52.3% ASD+). Majority of the participants had full or part time work (72.8% with individuals with ASD and 65.9% ASD+). All examined characteristics were uniform between the groups. Demographic characteristics of the caregivers and children by diagnosis (ASD vs. ASD+) are presented in Table 1.

From the moment when the caregivers sought the help of experts, until the diagnosis of ASD or ASD+, 1-3 months have passed for 20.2% children, 4-6 months for 11.4%, and 7-11 months for 7.0%. But, most often the diagnosis is made after one year (in 25.4%), or two or more years (25.4%), after initial contact with mental health professionals. There is no significant difference between the ASD and ASD+ groups.
Caregivers answered questions about the level of support before the pandemic, as well as the impact of the pandemic on the behavior and overall daily functioning of their children which is presented in Table 3.

We obtained data regarding services before pandemic outbreak and problems during the pandemic. To the question if the school / kindergarten that the child attended provided additional help/support services before pandemic, we obtained statistically significant results, comparing patients who have only ASD to ones with ASD+ children. Namely, school/kindergarten that the child attended provided more often additional help and support services to children diagnosed with ASD, before the outbreak of the pandemic compared to respondents with ASD+ (47.1% vs 16.0%, p=0.002) (Table 3).
During the pandemic, worsening of sleep problems was registered in 34.2% of the total sample, statistically significant more common in children with ASD+ (ASD+ 47.7% vs. ASD 25.7%, p=0.046) (Table 3). When it comes to changes in behavior and everyday life skills, as well as general functioning, there was no statistically significant difference between these two groups. However, we obtained clinically significant data that during the pandemic, there was worsening of problematic behavior present in 43.0% of the total population and uniformly between groups (42.9% and 43.2%, p=0.170). Everyday life skills deteriorated during the pandemic in 19.3% of the total sample and were equalized between groups (14.3% and 27.3%, respectively, p=0.172). Mental health deteriorated in 31.6% of the total sample and was uniform between groups (68.6% and 56.8%, respectively, p=0.355). The other important area of overall functioning is worsening of repetitive behavior, and it was observed in 39.5% of the total sample, i.e. in 45.7% of ASD and 29.5% of ASD+ during pandemic (p=0.101). Also, we observed worsening of social interaction in 22.8% of the total population which was equalized between groups (27.1% and 15.9%, respectively, p=0.265). Deterioration in communication was observed in 27.2% of the total sample, i.e. 27.1% ASD and 27.3% ASD+ (p=0.922). Sensory problems worsened in 22.8% of the total population, respectively 20.0% ASD and 27.3% ASD+ (p=0.281). Worsening of education problems was observed in 31.6% of the total population, i.e. 30% of ASD and 34.1% of ASD (p=0.899). During the pandemic, health

problems remained unchanged in 93.9% of the total sample, i.e. in 97.1% of ASD and 88.6% of ASD+ (p=0.179). There were no significant changes in feeding problems and issue of insecurity during the pandemic compared to the previous period.
When asked about caregiver's top three priorities for families whose child is affected by some developmental disorder in Serbia, they most often stressed the need to improve mental health services (65.8%), relatively evenly among ASD and ASD+ groups (Table 4). Second in line is better protection of human rights of persons with special needs, 61.4% (ASD 52.9%, ASD+ 75.0%). In third place is the improvement of the education system (59.6%), without significant differences by groups. Other needs highlighted by parents as very important for people with ASD in Serbia are: service development (43.9%), finance (56.1%), greater community awareness (36.8%), and more information relevant to the child's condition (36.0%) and improvement of health services in the field of physical health (27.2%).
DISCUSSION
When it comes to comorbidities, our results differ from the data available in literature where ADHD presents the most common comorbidity of ASD. Our results show the absence of ADHD as a comorbidity, which can be interpreted as a cultural influence on the diagnosis of ADHD (Taylor & Timimi 2004, Mazzone & Vitiello 2016). In Serbia, diagnosis of both disorders DOVRLVQRWEDVHGRQ³JROGVWDQGDUGV´7KHUHVXOWVVKRZ that ASD is diagnosed after the age of four in more than 52% of cases. The explanation can be found in the fact that ASD in clinical practice is replaced with the GLDJQRVLV 'LVKDUPRQLF GHYHORSPHQW´ ;aviera et al. 2015), most often in order to prevent stigmatization (Pejovic-Milovancevic et al. 2018). Among pediatricians, general psychiatrists and psychologist the prevailing tendency is to wait until the child is 36 months old. Underdiagnosing of ASD is also present in developed countries (Lai et al. 2019, Elsabbagh et al. 2012). On the other hand, ADHD is often recognized DV D ³QRUPDO GHYHORSPHQW´ DQG ZLWKLQ $6' $'+'

appears to be difficult to recognize as a comorbid diagnosis. It can also be seen that the wait for an ASD diagnosis is also long (in 48.8% of cases it lasted longer than a year).
The presumption of our study was that altered living conditions and daily functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic could have a particular impact on the ASD and ADS+ populations. Pandemic conditions certainly disrupt daily routines, and an important part of the clinical presentation of ASD is hypersensitivity and poor response to change (Umucu & Lee 2020).
The results of our study show that in both groups, ASD and ASD+, there was a worsening of both autism symptoms and general behavioral problems. This result is consistent with the findings of other researchers who have dealt with behavioral changes in children with ASD during altered pandemic conditions, even with very similar results (Patel et al. 2020).
Our results also reveal that in both groups there was deterioration in repetitive behavior patterns (as much as 39.5%), acquired skills of daily self-care, social interaction and sensory problems, with additional difficulties in education. A natural course of social communication problems and sensory problems in people with ASD, has either improvement, or the condition has remained unchanged over the years (Hasen et al. 2014, Mazurek et al. 2012). Our findings of deterioration could represents a significant change and confirms the potential negative impact of the emerging pandemic conditions on this population. Also, our findings are consistent with a similar study, during the COVID-19 pandemic, where it was found that in their examined population of parents of children with ASD there was a worsening of problematic behavior patterns, problems with aggression, self-harm and sensory problems (Mutluer et al. 2020). In addition, participating caregivers report deterioration in social communication, increased stereotypes, sensory hypersensitivity and aggression during the COVID-19 pandemic (Mutluer et al. 2020). Research on this topic by other authors also reveals much more intense (in 35.5% of respondents) and much more frequent (in 41.5% of respondents) behavioral problems in the population with ASD whose parents participated in this study, compared to the period before the pandemic (Colizzi et al. 2020). Lifestyle changes during a pandemic can also be classified as a potentially traumatic experience, especially given that individual reactions of people with ASD to altered pandemic conditions are similar to symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Peterson et al. 2019). This view is based on the study of specific symptoms of PTSD in people with ASD (aggressive behavior, self-harm, sleep and concentration problems, common in people with ASD after trauma) (Storch et al. 2013). It can be observed that the main finding of PTSD symptoms in children with ASD, namely,

increased behavioral problems, aggressive behavior, irritability, increased stereotypes, worsening of social communication, as well as problems with feeding and sleeping, are all symptoms that overlap with obtained in behavioral changes in children with ASD during the COVID-19 pandemic, as supported by the findings of our research. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that the current, prolonged pandemic situation can cause such symptoms, and professionals who deal with the mental health of this population should notice the appearance of these symptoms on time, or their worsening, for a prompt therapeutic response (Narzisi 2020).
The results show that the worsening of ASD symptoms and behavioral problems has occurred during the pandemic, however, the difference between the groups was not significant. This may indicate that the primary disorder (ASD) presents a major risk for symptom exacerbation of this vulnerable group rather than its comorbidities. Namely, prolonged time of confinement in the house and changes in daily routines with insufficient understanding of the resulting changes can affect these deteriorations. However, perhaps the factor that has the greatest impact on such worsening of symptoms and overall functioning is the lack of previous help from experts dealing with this population and changes in the school system (online teaching, termination of schooling and direct participation in previous school routines, which also affects the structure of daily functioning 2¶6XOOLYDQ HW DO  :H EHOLHYH WKDW WKLV IDFWRU should be especially considered in relation to planning future support for this population in the changed general conditions of functioning. Namely, the results we obtained show that sufficient education provided by school or another institution had only 9.6% of respondents, which is a significantly smaller number than before the pandemic. As many as 67.5% had no education provided at all, which may be a significant additional factor in the general deterioration of the functioning of this population.
Challenges that parents face in getting support for their child during the pandemic, are related to getting adequate social assistance/support for the child, lack of school education and the protection of fundamental rights. Caregivers of children with ASD+ are significantly more committed to the protection of the human rights of individuals with special needs, compared to those with ASD children only. This is expected, given that the needs of their children are objectively greater. In 65.8% of cases, both groups of caregivers are in favor of improving health services in the field of mental health, in contrast to the needs of improving health services in the field of physical health, for which 27.2% of caregivers are in favor.
The overall satisfaction with the received support during a pandemic is estimated as low. Most basic factors contributing to the parental dissatisfaction are: FKLOG¶V EHKDYLRUDO SUREOHPV ODFN RI VRFLDO VXSSRUW DQG lack of adequate health and educational services.

CONCLUSIONS
Our research shows significant behavioral difficulties in the population with ASD and ASD + that arose in the field of altered living conditions and overall functioning during the COVID 19 pandemic. Understanding its impact on this population is crucial for planning psychosocial and therapeutic interventions, as well as those related to the education of these individuals, and educational treatments related to everyday life skills (Peterson et al. 2019).
By identifying all aspects of this problem, we can contribute to the faster development and implementation of protocols for dealing with situations such as pandemics, related to the vulnerable population of children with ASD and their caregivers. Therefore, such research is positioned as a priority in order to see global needs and barriers and develop strategies to address the problems of the ASD population and their caregivers in changed and more complex living conditions.
Limitations of study are that the questionnaire was distributed exclusively through electronic communications and social networks. Therefore, the questionnaires were filled out on a voluntary basis only by those who wanted and who are otherwise users of these networks. It is possible that the findings of this study might be more prominent in the excluded group of families. Also, self-report measures may lead to different response biases or memory recall, which impedes generalization of our findings.

Predicting COVID-19 cases in various scenarios using RNN-LSTM models aided by adaptive linear regression to identify data anomalies
LUIS RICARDO ARANTES FILHO, MARCOS L. RODRIGUES, REINALDO R. ROSA & LAMARTINE N.F. GUIMARÃES
Abstract: The evolution of the Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus pandemic has revealed that the problems of social inequality, poverty, public and private health systems guided by controversial public policies are much more complex than was conceived before the pandemic. Therefore, understanding how COVID-19 evolves in society and looking at the infection spread is a critical task to support efficient epidemiological actions capable of suppressing the rates of infections and deaths. In this article, we analyze daily COVID-19 infection data with two objectives: (i) to test the predictive power of a Recurrent Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory (RNN-LSTM) on the daily stochastic fluctuation in different scenarios, and (ii) analyze, through adaptive linear regression, possible anomalies in the reported data to provide a more realistic and reliable scenario to support epidemic control actions. Our results show that the approach is even more suitable for countries, states or cities where the rate of testing, diagnosis and prevention were low during the virus dissemination. In this sense, we focused on investigating countries and regions where the disease evolved in a severe and poorly controlled way, as in Brazil, highlighting the favelas in Rio de Janeiro as a regional scenario. Key words: COVID-19, machine learning, RNN-LSTM, Brazil, favelas, Rio de Janeiro.
INTRODUCTION
The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19), has severely affected humanity in various segments, such as the public health, economy, and political sectors. Moreover, the disease raises severe infections and has a high spreading capability, which makes it lethal in many cases. By August 2021, about 200 million cases have been counted, with approximately 4.5 million deaths, and as indicated by various studies the normality recovery, even with the available vaccines (Sinovac, Pfizer, Astrazeneca, Moderna, Janssen), will be slow and difficult (Tian et al. 2020, Lauer et al. 2020, Anjos 2020, The Lancet 2020, Sharma et al. 2021).
Thus, actions to monitor and control the virus spreading play a fundamental role in reducing the number of infected people and, consequently, the number of related deaths. In this sense, this work brings two complementary machine learning approaches to understanding the stochastic nature of COVID-19. Firstly, we test a prediction strategy for COVID-19 based on Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber 1997a,b) attempt to establish relationships in data that have long-term temporal dependencies through memory cells (memory

PREDICTING AND TREND ANALYSIS OF COVID-19 CASES

neurons, context nodes) that retain information for long periods during training epochs. Such a deep learning model is able to learn intrinsic information in time series data, allowing learning and inferring predictions with good accuracy and precision1. The concept of Deep Learning (DL) corresponds to techniques directed at artificial neural networks to explore and amplify the power of nonlinear data analysis using a large number of intermediate layers (Deng et al. 2014, Goodfellow et al. 2016, Vasilev et al. 2019). The LSTM-RNN algorithms were implemented in Python using Keras2.
We consider COVID-19 infection reported daily from January to August 2020 (Voz das Comunidades 2020, Worldometer 2020), analyzing the daily transmission fluctuation in a period where the main suppression factor would be social isolation (about six months before vaccination starts). In this study, we focus on observing the evolution of confirmed cases in some countries, especially in Brazil, including data related to favelas in Rio de Janeiro. Such scenarios allow us to infer how robust the LSTM models are to improve the understanding, monitoring and prediction of the infection transmission rate. Therefore, we have applied LSTM models based on specific cause and effect criteria, strictly related to each COVID-19 time series behavior, verifying the effectiveness of these criteria on its fluctuation and evolution in different scenarios. We provide a background of events in the countries that had their first contact with the virus and how the authorities and society have dealt with the pandemic. We looked at certain criteria linked to the disease's behavior and its impacts, such as how symptoms occur, the average time to diagnosis, time to treatment, and the effects of epidemiological control interventions made by the authorities, such as lockdown actions (Tian et al. 2020, Lauer et al. 2020, Zhou et al. 2020, Chen & Yu 2020).
We have analysed data from 12 different countries on a grid of parameters resulting in about 288 predictive time series models. The application of these models in specific regional scenario, as Rio's favelas, helps to identify how the disease evolves in communities that lack basic health structure and conditions that make both social distance and lockdown actions extremely difficult (Voz das Comunidades 2020, Worldometer 2020). In most of these virus transmission scenarios an important aspect to be discussed is the quality of data collection, subject to outliers such as underreporting. Therefore, as a complementary approach we use Adaptive Linear Regression to detect data anomalies (outliers) in the daily cases of COVID-19 infections. This approach allows the data to be treated with more confidence by getting closer to the actual pandemic behavior after removing the outliers values. In this way, the models can come closer to identifying the actual scenario caused by human influence on pandemic control (Taylor & Letham 2017). At this stage, the anomaly detection approach was focused on two specific countries, Brazil and the USA, which, in addition to presenting the anomalies in accounting for daily infection cases, have the worst scenarios related to a large number of infected people and deaths.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We describe, in section Related Works, some published results related to the approaches of this paper. In section Materials and Methods, we explain the methodology that indicates the main steps in selecting and collecting the data to feed the LSTM models, explaining how these models can be parameterized and trained, and how the predictions are validated by handling the data to remove anomalies in the time series.

we present the main results related to both approaches. The section Conclusions, touches on the critical interpretation of these approaches, as well as a discussion of our work in progress capable of improving results by updating the data.

RELATED WORKS
To contextualize the research presented in this article, we describe below some published works whose approaches are in the same analytical context as those discussed in the previous section.
The work presented by Kirba et al. (2020) indicates a comparison of several approaches for predicting COVID-19 cases. The researched models correspond to ARIMA, NARNN, and LSTM models. The analyzed data were the total number of confirmed cases in countries such as Denmark, Belgium, Germany, France, the UK, Finland, Switzerland, and Turkey. According to Kirba et al. (2020), the model with the best prediction performance was the LSTM model, hence the authors present the prediction of the total number of cases in 14 days for the selected countries. In the same line, the authors Chimmula & Zhang (2020) present a DL model to predict the outbreak of COVID-19 in Canada. These authors evaluated LSTM models to predict trends in the data of COVID-19 cases and, so, they indicate by these models the moment when the cases start to decrease.
Recently, there have been many studies on the prediction of COVID-19 growth using DL techniques. However, few of them consider the end of the epidemic. At the forefront of this goal Yan et al. (2020), shows the first LSTM model to predict daily cases considering the end of the epidemic and compares with two other approaches based on Logistics and Hill mathematics models. The main result achieved for this study was the best forecast model concerning real data on the number of cases in Tianjin, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Italy. The novelty method proposed, uses Fully connected layers to emulate the disease incubation period combined with an LSTM model to find factors that influence potential cases. The authors pointed out that their approach can better handle multiple characteristics, such as the number of cumulative diagnoses, the number of deaths, city lockdown, the number of new diagnoses, the growth rate of deaths, etc. On the other hand, the authors point out that the logistic regression model loses its performance when there are multiple features in the model. The improved method used 21 days of input data to predict 7 days. For all regions studied, this method had performed better and more accurate results than traditional logistic and hill equation prediction algorithms.
Arora et al. (2020) present a model for predicting positive cases of COVID-19 for 32 states in India by evaluating the performance of recurrent neural network models and alternative LSTM models. In the same paper, the authors also present an approach that combines DL techniques such as Convolutional LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM to predict the number of positive cases on a daily and weekly frequency. Arora et al. (2020) also points out that, because of their performance, the same models may be suitable for analysis in other countries. A similar approach has been explored by Yudistira (2020), who uses LSTM models to check the disease expansion rate.
The approach proposed by Tomar & Gupta (2020) tries to make it easier to count COVID-19 cases to avoid the burden on the agents involved in identifying the case and controlling the infected people. Thus, the authors developed a LSTM network model to predict the total number of COVID-19 cases in India, indicating models that can predict the next 30 days of disease progression. Highlighting the

importance of applying ML methods to different problems Lalmuanawma et al. (2020) have developed a study exploring different approaches related to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to problems arising from COVID-19, which include both prediction and clinical analysis tasks, medication and the monitoring of infected people.
Regarding the performance of prediction models for COVID-19 cases Anirudh (2020) points out the challenges in the development of models with an epidemiological nature discussing approaches related to models such as SIR, SEIR, SEIRU, SIRD, SLIAR, ARIMA, SIDARTHE, and their performance in predicting the peak of the disease, the spreading evolution, and transmission rates.
In relation to the field of analysis of time series dynamics Pereira et al. (2020) presents a model to identify the behavior of the disease in several countries and the particular Brazilian scenario. The model uses clustering algorithms to verify the epidemic similarities in various regions where the disease is at an advanced stage.
In summary, all the works mentioned above demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of the computational nonlinear models to improve the data analysis related to the COVID-19 dynamics. Although better than other approaches, the DL techniques still does not allow good predictions about the emergence of second and third waves, as well as the end of the pandemic. However, such works helped us to choose better settings for our LSTM hyperparameters and encouraged us to consider the outliers, which are still little explored so far by COVID-19's monitoring and forecasting models.
Basically, inspired by the previous published work discussed in this section, we define our new analytical approach as follows: (i) we consider as input the daily measure of new COVID-19 cases from different scenarios (country level and also more regional levels , with emphasis on the favelas of Rio de Janeiro); (ii) we tested, adjusted and validated for each scenario an RNN-LSTM prediction model; (iii) we identify and discuss several anomalies that may result in scenario-specific outliers; (iv) we refined the analysis using the Linear Regression technique to impute possible values neglected by public policies. Based on the Prophet tool (Taylor & Letham 2017), we combine linear regression and statistical data imputation within a machine learning paradigm that we call here Adaptive Linear Regression. Materials and analytical methodology related to these approaches are detailed in the next section.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
To present the materials, methods and analysis used in this work, we defined the main stages of our study. First, we developed all data analysis and prediction models from the identification of COVID-19 outbreaks in scenarios with extreme fluctuations. Such patterns reflect a lack of control over infection suppression in competing scenarios (countries, regions, states, cities and local communities). Thus, this work seeks to address the daily COVID-19 complexity at different population scales with the aim of generating information that helps to reduce the rate of infections and, consequently, deaths caused by the disease in specific spatiotemporal scales.
Thus, based on identified cause and effect characteristics for each time series, we build LSTM models for each scenario. After modeling and parameterization, we train and validate each LSTM model. Validation occurs through statistical analysis of each series and forecast evaluation considering anomalies and outliers. If there is any anomaly in the time series, the data will be

submitted to the Statistical Imputation process, imposing an adaptive regression to the analysis. Figure 1 shows how the processes occur for the development of the models and data analysis. The methodology diagram aims to briefly indicate how each process is done to cover all the proposed methods and analysis of this approach, thus indicating to the readers all the main steps of the methodology to guide them in the manuscript reading.
The two approaches described in the first section are complemented by four methodological principles (different colors in the methodological diagram (Figure 1)), which constitute our analytical approach. The methods and parameters introduced in the diagram in Figure 1 are described in detail following the methodological order of approaching the data. It starts with the description of the input data considering the LSTM model, indicating the inputs to obtain predictions through a subsampling method. All necessary introductory material on the fundamental concepts of LSTM neural networks is described in detail in the Appendix. It then proceeds to describe the behavior of the disease (fluctuation of daily cases of SARS-Cov-2 infection) in the context of input data adopted by the LSTM models. We then proceed to select the parameters for training the models, including the number of models generated and the computational cost described as the processing time required for a predefined hardware. Methods related to the statistical treatment of fluctuations found in the daily data of reported COVID-19 cases are also explicitly considered in the approach. The main materials and methods related to adaptive linear regression models to find anomalies in data are based on the Prophet package. Data abnormalities are then considered and identified. Finally, the data with the anomaly are treated and normalized for insertion into LSTM models.
Data Scenario in the Context of LSTM Models
The effects of the pandemic differ in many aspects in different countries and their internal regions. In Brazil, such effects become at some point more diverse and unpredictable, since each state, region

and city has had different strategies to face the pandemic. Therefore, our LSTM models are designed to understand the spread of the disease in distinct scenarios, with more attention to the case of Brazil and in communities, such as favelas, where basic hygienic and sanitary conditions are limited. In a such complex scenario, where long-term effects get easily out of control, daily infection cases monitoring, when possible, is most desirable.
A further point of interest concerns the personal diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is well known that each studied scenario had a different approach to testing for COVID-19. According to Worldometer3 Brazil has a low level of testing 6.94 per million (1M) inhabitants compared to other countries Italy 75.48 / 1M, USA 73.28 / 1M and South Korea 21.35 / 1M. Figure 2 shows testing data from 4 countries in completely different situations regarding mass testing of their population, with Brazil being the one with low levels on the moving average of 7 days for testing per million inhabitants. Thus, methods that can predict the evolution of the disease in places with lower testing rates become essential.

Figure 2. Brazil has a low level of daily COVID tests according to Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) publication data (Ritchie et al. 2020).
For this purpose, we have developed LSTM models to deal with each country and region aside. Data used to feed the predictive models refer to the Our World in Data (Ritchie et al. 2020) database from January to July 2020. For particular regions, we have applied a database concerning the occurrence of cases in communities (favelas) in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil, provided by Voz das Comunidades (2020) from April to August 2020.
As each county exhibited different behaviors in dealing with the pandemic, we looked at the main features that distinguish them, such as the decrease in their infection rate or a significant evolution in the number of daily cases of COVID-19. Such observations provided a basis for predictive models that learn from different and simultaneous fluctuations in the time series data. In this way, we have

selected and grouped each country into different control situations corresponding to the pandemic stage in each nation. Countries have been grouped as follows:
Critical Group: Brazil, USA, India, South Africa and Russia;
Attention and Impact Group: Australia, Portugal, China, Italy and Switzerland;
Successful Group: South Korea and New Zealand.
The Critical Group corresponds to the countries where the COVID-19 pandemic grew out of control, leading to a large number of daily cases and deaths. In these countries, the politicization of the pandemic has caused important divergences in society, undermining the measures to control it. In these countries, the number of daily cases still evolves in many days, and it is difficult to decrease the number of infections and deaths. Figure 3 shows the evolution of COVID-19 cases on the logarithmic scale for the critical group.

Figure 3. COVID-19 daily cases evolution for critical group countries in log scale. Source Ritchie et al. (2020).
The Impact and Attention Group consists of those countries which at the onset of the outbreak have not taken effective epidemiological control policies and restrictions, which has resulted in a high number of cases and deaths over a short time. In such cases, the restrictive control epidemiological policies have been controlling the growth of the epidemic. This group also corresponds to countries that have adopted epidemiological control policies which are becoming less effective and are on the verge of showing growth in the number of daily cases. Figure 4 shows the evolution of daily cases on the logarithmic scale for the attention and impact group.
The Successful Group consists of those countries that have adopted severe control measures and, thus, these countries have been able to contain the pandemic. Such countries adopted strong restrictive measures on people's circulation, a high testing rate per million inhabitants, and a high potential to track and control the infected people. It should be pointed out that China has adopted

severe epidemiological policies, however, these actions took place after the outbreak of the disease. Figure 5 shows the evolution of cases on the logarithmic scale for the successful group.
By looking at these different scenarios (shown in the figures 3, 4, and 5), we avoided a global model to predict daily cases, so we considered a different model for each country or region. That is, we conducted different training steps for each country and region.

PREDICTING AND TREND ANALYSIS OF COVID-19 CASES

Thus, we present a methodology to develop prediction models for daily COVID-19 cases based on the observation of different epidemic scenarios. As input, the prediction models receive the number of days in which the time-series learning strategy must be done to estimate future points, i.e., the number of predicted cases. Different types of models indicate possible ways to feed a time-series forecasting model that can observe N points in time {t = n, t = n - 1, t = n - 2, t = n - 3, ..., t = 1} to estimate the correspondent next values {t = n + 1, t = n + 2, t = n + 3...}. An output y in time {t = n + 1} may be dependent on the correspondent inputs X {t = n, t = n - 1, t = n - 2, ..., t = 1}.
In the artificial neural networks context, the definition of inputs and outputs is highly important to the behavior and performance of regression, classification, and predictive models. For example, in a time series, every input X[i] corresponds to the features that must be learned and mapped to their respective outputs y[i]. Machine learning models, which are the models described in this paper, work as learning a target function f that maps the points of the time series (x) to their respective outputs y, that is, the next points in the time series (prediction points), so that y = f (x).
Our prediction models require the correct declaration of inputs and outputs for their proper use. For time series, the input X and output y data must be arranged according to the framework and definitions of the LSTM models {1..1, 1..N, N..1, N..N}. We have arranged the data for the prediction of the LSTM models by sub-sampling through a rolling window method (Zivot & Wang 2007).
The Rolling window methodology consists in choosing some parameters that will be key factors for the analysis and forecast sensitiveness of a model, such as window size, m, that is, the size of an input that corresponds to the number of consecutive window observations. The size of the rolling windows depends on the size of the time series, T. An additional parameter is the prediction horizon, h, i.e., the output prediction size of the models. This prediction horizon depends on the features of the data and the intended application. Figure 6 shows how the inputs and outputs pass through the time series creating rolling windows through the data. In this paper, each time series of daily COVID-19 infections has been applied to the rolling window sub-sampling method where each window is subjected to pattern learning by LSTM networks that estimate the prediction horizon, i.e., the model outputs to predict new daily cases.
The architecture of LSTM models was defined after a set of test and training approaches where the parameters were varied for each training epoch. Those parameters were set according to the RMSE value in the tests, i.e., we chose the architecture that provided the best RMSE value for the predictions. Table I summarizes the model architecture setting the main described LSTM hyper-parameters.

are activated by the ReLU function. The developed LSTM models are based on the so-called N...N architecture (many input points allow the prediction of many output points) (Figure 7).
Parameterization of LSTM Models Based on Cause and Effect Criteria
We have attempted to contextualize the dynamics of the disease corresponding to how the infections spread and the time over which an infected person is diagnosed with the disease, thus resulting in a new case. The goal of this contextualization is to establish scientific criteria in the parameterization of LSTM models for the prediction of new daily cases of COVID-19 and, consequently, observing the eventual progression or stability of the pandemic.
These LSTM models are highly sensitive to parameter values set for the chosen input and output days. Thus, it is important to understand the dynamics of the infection and how new cases are reported to establish strong criteria for choosing these days. This characteristic of RNNs can lead to some inconsistencies in replicating the prediction results. Hence, we have defined the following rules for choosing the parameters for the input and output days of the model:
Disease behavior: How soon are the first symptoms noticed?
Identification period: After the appearance of the first symptoms, for how long are healthcare actions taken? Such as seeking medical attention or tests to identify the COVID-19 infection.
Time of disease treatment: How long does a person identified with COVID-19 reduce their viral load and recover from hospital treatments?
Authorities Control Actions: After identifying a large number of infected people and establishing an epidemic state, how soon are epidemiological control actions, such as lockdown, taken?
Disease Behavior. According to Tian et al. (2020), the infections related to COVID-19 can present different scenarios, such as severe cases, mild cases, cases without pneumonia, and asymptomatic cases. This study covered about 262 patients in several hospitals in Beijing in February 2020, when COVID-19 cases in China became internationally notable. Several cases and symptoms affect the way people seek medical assistance to identify what is the cause of the infection. The common symptoms observed in the study conducted by Tian et al. (2020) include fever, cough, fatigue, loss of olfactory and taste sensors, and headache, the combination of one or more symptoms characterizing the severe condition. The important observation made by Tian et al. (2020) was that the average period of virus incubation in the patient, that is, the period until the first symptoms of the disease appear, was 6.7 days. The same behavior was observed by another study by Lauer et al. (2020) that considered the characteristics of the disease and its spread in 181 patients who had symptoms. Lauer et al. (2020) observed that the estimated virus incubation period varied between 4.5 to 5.8 days, and the development of symptoms occurs between 8.2 to 15.6 days.
Identification Period. According to studies that pointed out the time when the infected person develops the first symptoms of the disease, the identification period criterion is related to the time when a person, aware of infection symptoms (not necessarily aware of the infection by COVID-19), seeks medical care. According to Tian et al. (2020) the average time these patients sought medical assistance was about 4.5 days after the occurrence of first symptoms. Regarding the study made by Lauer et al.

An Acad Bras Cienc (2022) 94(Suppl. 3) e20210921 11 | 37

LUIS RICARDO ARANTES FILHO et al.

PREDICTING AND TREND ANALYSIS OF COVID-19 CASES

(2020) 97.5% of the people sample took an average of 11.5 days to show the illness symptoms and consequently seek medical care.
Time of disease treatment. After the initial symptoms identification and the seeking of medical care, a relevant measure for controlling LSTM models is connected with the time necessary for a patient to be recovered of the disease. This pertinent remark has been discussed by Zhou et al. (2020) and turns out to be a crucial factor that implies decisions to isolate patients, make resources available for treatment, and then make projections regarding the availability of intensive care unit beds specifically for severe respiratory illness. Thus, Zhou et al. (2020) observed the average time from infection discovery to the end of hospital treatment in a group of 41 patients hospitalized in the Western District, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, from February to March 2020. They discovered that viral load reduction in hospitalized patients occurs in a period of 24 to 40 days after identifying COVID-19 infection. The shortest period to eliminate and reduce viral load was 18 days, while the longest was 48 days. There were no significant differences in this period for men and women and considering the ages in people over 65 and under 65. Regarding the time a patient was discharged from the hospital, the average period was 32 to 46 days. The shortest period observed for a patient to be considered recovered was 24 days, while the longest was 56 days. No major differences in time were observed with respect to the age of the patients or with respect to the gender of the patients.
Authorities Control Actions. The epidemiological control action criterion adopted by authorities (governments, public officials, scientists, etc.) is related to the first months in which the COVID-19 event was observed in a country. Due to the observation of the days when the disease affects the population and how long people seek medical assistance (Lauer et al. 2020, Tian et al. 2020, Zhou et al. 2020) taking control actions become difficult and must be done in an emergency scenario. The first countries to experience an outbreak with the Sars-CoV-2 virus were China and Italy. According to Chen & Yu (2020), in China, the actions has taken followed a total emergency criterion, as there was no knowledge of the disease COVID-19 and the number of hospitalizations and the number of cases could collapse the health system. In Italy, the epidemiological actions were slowly, although already known the epidemic in China. Chen & Yu (2020) consider that strict actions should be taken as outlined below:
1. identify those infected and take them to hospital treatment for infectious diseases;
2. locate and quarantine all those who have had contact with those infected;
3. sterilize environmental pathogens;
4. promoting the use of masks and disclosing to the public the number of infected, suspected, under treatment and daily deaths and cases;
5. provide for closure of all public and private activities that promote crowds of people. Establish a closure of all non-essential activities for some time.
Observing these control actions, in the Chinese case provided an epidemic regression in about 14 days (Tian et al. 2020). According to Chen and Yu (2020), after the detection of the COVID-19 outbreak, between January to February 2020, a considerable and accelerated decline in the number of cases from February 18 onwards. This was highlighted when the daily number of infected people dropped

PREDICTING AND TREND ANALYSIS OF COVID-19 CASES

from 44 to 2 in a period of 11 days, evidencing the efficiency of the actions adopted by this country. In cases where control actions were slow, the number of infections and deaths have an expressive growth, it was observed in Italy, the USA, and Brazil. In these countries, the epidemic of COVID-19 has been politicized and underestimated, the lack of adopting rigorous epidemiological actions has resulted several cases and deaths. Looking at the overall pandemic scenario, by August 2021 only in Brazil and the USA about 63 million cases and approximately 1.3 million deaths were counted. We cannot underestimate the pandemic's severity, since around the world more than 200 million cases of infections and approximately 4.5 million deaths have already been recorded (Ritchie et al. 2020, Worldometer 2020, Voz das Comunidades 2020).

Cause and Effect criteria
Based on the scenarios described above where some typical time windows, of cause and effect, were empirically found, we decided to make the LSTM model more realistic from them. Therefore, the choice of parameters for the LSTM models summarizes this contextualization in a pandemic Cause-Effect principle.
As Cause object we have chosen the criteria of Disease Behavior and Identification Period, which are consistent with the initial perception of symptoms and the identification of the disease, observing both the clinical evaluation and testing methods. The Cause object represents the number of input days for the prediction in the LSTM models.
As Effect object we have chosen the criteria of Time of Disease Treatment and Authorities Control Actions that are consistent with the actions to combat the pandemic itself. It represents the intensive action of health professionals as the adoption of severe control actions to decrease the number of infected people. The Effect object represents the number of output days for the prediction in the LSTM models. According to the established criteria, the input values of the models have been chosen as:
Days when the first symptoms appear: 5, 7 and 10 days on average;
Days when symptoms are detected and medical diagnosis occurs: 10 and 15 days on average;
In this way, the cause object comprises the range of 5 to 15 days as input parameters for the forecasting models. According to the established criteria, the output values of the models have been chosen as:
Considering the period in which the identification of the disease occurs (5 to 15 days) and the period which the treatment lasts from 32 to 40 days average, the range of this criterion is between 15 to 25 days after disease detection;
Considering the period of action occurring as soon as the COVID-19 outbreak is detected, implying the crowding of hospitals and an increasing number of deaths, the effect of control actions is observed from 10 to 15 days. We can estimate that the range of this criterion occurs between 25 to 40 days after the identification of the epidemic.
In this way, the effect object comprises the range of 15 to 40 days as output parameters for the forecasting models. Thus, the Table II indicates the parameters of input and output days for the LSTM

models to estimate the daily infection cases of COVID-19. We set all the LSTM models with 1000 training epochs, and the processing time of each one has varied according to the input/output parameters.
Table II. Input and output parameters for LSTM models.

Input days
5 7 10 15

Output Days Range 1 15 15 15 15

Output Days Range 2 20 20 20 20

Output Days Range 3 25 25 25 25

Output Days Range 4 30 30 30 30

Output Days Range 5 35 35 35 35

Output Days Range 6 40 40 40 40

Thus, we have developed 288 prediction models to forecast new daily cases of infection for each country in the groups, estimating at least 15 days of the decrease or progression of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we only selected the LSTM models that achieved the best validation result based on RMSE score. Processing time for all 288 models took 3 days on a 6 Gigabyte NVIDIA Ge-Force GTX-1060 platform.
After training the models and choosing the best prediction results, we perform a careful analysis of the time series to identify the quality of the data regarding the daily cases of COVID-19. In this process, we seek to identify if the data are being correctly computed, if there are inconsistencies in the time series, if there are anomalies coming from the sources themselves, such as data collected from health agencies, and finally, if there are unexpected seasonalities that do not match the actual behavior of COVID-19. After going through this analysis the prediction models can be validated.
Thus, we discuss these issues and approaches in the next subsections dealing with statistical analysis and time series treatment.
Dealing with the under-reporting case problem
The fast spread of the COVID-19 epidemic around the world has had an important impact on the health systems of several countries. Although some have shown greater resilience, such as New Zealand and South Korea, due to mass testing and restrictive measures such as lockdown, others have not been sufficiently prepared, for political and ideological choices (The Lancet 2020). In this context, countries like Brazil and USA have presented high rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. In addition, technical and structural problems have repeatedly shown cases of underreporting on weekends in Brazil, even when the trend indicates that the number of cases is growing or remaining at a high level above 30,000 daily cases. In order to present a closer picture of the real number of cases throughout the epidemic in the country, we conducted a study to identify anomalous values4 in the historical series of case records and applied techniques to input values where the data present behavior of outlier in relation to the real dynamics of the disease in Brazil.
4The definition for anomaly depends on the domain of the problem, but in general we can assume that an anomaly is an outlier point. "An outlier is an observation that appears to deviate markedly from other observations in the sample NIST/SEMATECH (2013)."

PREDICTING AND TREND ANALYSIS OF COVID-19 CASES

Daily Cases

Abnormal weekly seasonality in Brazil daily cases

The Brazil and the USA are experiencing similar situations in this pandemic, with high numbers of new cases, above 30,000 on average, and more than 1,000 daily deaths. However, as we can see in Figure 8, notifications about the disease show different behaviors in both. The number of cases in Brazil reported by state health agencies and compiled by Worldometer specialists5 show recurrent decreases at the end of the week and the beginning of the week, while in the USA6 this weekly seasonality is not demonstrated.

In order to deal with the seasonality effects of the data in both countries and to identify anomalies in the time series, we used Prophet, an open source framework for time series forecasting proposed for Taylor & Letham (2017) and released by Facebook's Core Data Science team7. This framework was initially developed for business forecasts and enable estimate non-linear trends fitted with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects to predict future and detect anomalies. It has been employed in COVID forecasting, for example, Wang et al. (2020) using the characteristics of historical data to predict the number of accumulated confirmed cases, recovered, death, and active confirmed cases of COVID in the global and regional context for some countries (Brazil, Russia, India, Peru, and Indonesia).
The Prophet is based on assumptions of an additive regression model y(t):

y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + t,

(1)

where g(t) is a trend function to model non-periodic changes of time series, s(t) is a component to model seasonality representing periodic changes, such as the periodicity a week or a year, h(t)

contributes information about holidays and recurrent events, and finally the error term t represents any idiosyncratic changes which are not accommodated by the model (Taylor & Letham 2017).
Prophet was created to permit further customization of the model using intuitive and easily interpretative options for improving the quality of the forecast. These parameters can be adjusted by non-experts in time series analysis, enabling optimizations and better results. Because the framework handles the main problems of scale such as computational and infrastructure, this way it is possible making forecasts without specific knowledge about time series training and methods only with a focus in the data generating process. Moreover, the Prophet have automated means of evaluating and comparing ensemble models to detecting when they performing poorly (Taylor & Letham 2017). Then, we use the Prophet in a context we call Adaptive Linear Regression (ALR). In this context, the algorithm admits incorporation of prior knowledge to find the best regression curve, thus behaving as a machine learning solution.
In this study, we have used Prophet to show that in Brazil there are anomalous values related to delays in the transmission of daily cases and the under-reporting of COVID-19 cases on weekends and Mondays. Although many countries have experienced difficulties in estimating the real number of infected people, in Brazil this is aggravated due to a small testing rates. According to Ribeiro & Bernardes (2020), the main factors which contribute for this are "the absence of adequate laboratory infrastructure and qualified people, which are often not available in the appropriate quantity; difficulty in buying tests due to high international demand and low availability of suppliers; logistical difficulty in the national distribution of tests in a country of continental dimensions such as Brazil".
We known that it is very difficult to model perfectly the COVID-19 dynamics because there are several factors can influence dissemination speed, for example, when countries close borders or determine lock-down and as a result of human behaviors like as social distancing. It changes all the time as the infection spreads, for this reason, the main goal of our approach was to demonstrate that in Brazil the disease cases show abnormal periodic changes (weekly) in time series. For that, we create an instance of Prophet to fit a model using data of Brazil and the USA simulating this seasonality, because both countries present similar characteristics in this pandemic.
Figures 9 and 10 show the results of fitted model using the number of daily cases (black circles) in Brazil and USA respectively, the band with 80% of uncertainty intervals (green band) and anomaly points (red circles).The importance size was determined based on the distance between the value and the upper or lower limit of the uncertainty band.
We perform trends analyses for Brazil and the USA using the options to identify weekly seasonality. Brazil presents an abnormal seasonality (weekly) that can be corroborated by the fact of presenting fewer anomalous points than the USA in this analysis. This behavior (weekly) does not reflect the real dynamics of the disease anywhere in the world. This evidence can be confirmed by analyzing of the components of weekly seasonality for both countries (Figures 11(a) and 11(b)). This demonstrates that in Brazil there is a great decrease in the registration of cases on weekends and Mondays.

Identifying anomalies in the data This way is very important to identify and handle anomalies (outliers) in time series data of cases in Brazil to reflect better the true situation of COVID spread in the country. Outlier identification depends

on how you able to define the unnatural behavior of the data. The methods of general-purpose for this are based on robust statistics, such as least-squares techniques, residual variance ratios among others (Tsay 1988).
Basically, our motivation was to initially identify the points in the data series that correspond to very high numbers of the cases (upper outliers) linked to notification delays, so that these points

were removed to did not influence the identification of cases of underreporting on weekends (lower

outliers). Thus, it was possible through a statistical method of data imputation to correct the time

series of daily cases with the objective to demonstrate a scenario closer to the reality of the COVID

epidemic in Brazil.

Detecting outliers in time series is particularly challenging because the process is based on

old data. In the cases of diseases like COVID where the outbreak revealed nonlinear and chaotic

characteristics (Chen & Yu 2020), this process can be even more complex. Normally, three issues with

regards to outliers can be specified: Outlier labeling, when we need to flag potential outliers for further

investigation; Outlier accommodation, when we cannot determine potential outliers and more robust

statistical techniques can be employed to take into account these observations; Outlier identification,

when we apply formally test to reveal whether observations are outliers (NIST/SEMATECH 2013).

Most of the methods for detecting outliers are based on the notion that the data have a normal

distribution, but our data with Skewness = 0.7962709 and Kurtosis = -0.4209722 clearly don't present this expected distribution8. This way, as the normality assumption for the data, is not valid, we decided

to use a method based on a robust moving window test over data to detect outliers. The Median

Absolute Deviation (MAD) is a method that defines the variation of the data related to the median, this

is a stronger measure than the standard deviation. Because the median used as a measure of central

tendency shows the advantage of being very insensitive to the presence of outliers. Additionally,

the MAD is independent of the sample size (Leys et al. 2013). This method enables detect outliers

continuously based on old data without the necessity to repeat tests, showing a low rate of false

positives.

The calculating of MAD involves finding the median of absolute deviations from the median and

can be expressed as:

MAD = b  median(abs(x - m))

(2)

where m is the median of values from vector x, the dimension of this vector is defined from the data days window used. The b constant is linked to the assumption of normality of the data, but disregarding the abnormality induced by outliers, the standard value defined for the normal distribution is b = 1.4826 Leys et al. (2013). We assumed b = 1 related our data distribution.
Our approach is based on the use of graphs to define the best adjustment of the time window size to be considered for the calculation of the median and the threshold value to remove the

8Skewness and Kurtosis are statistics of data distribution, the first measures lack of symmetry and the second is a measure of the heaviness of the distribution tails. A normal distribution (symmetric data) Skewness is zero, and Kurtosis equal three (NIST/SEMATECH 2013).

upper peaks relative to lag communication of daily cases, and in a second step identify lower peaks related to underreporting outliers. The elimination of upper peaks is necessary as they influence the determination of the expected variation in the data. Figure 12 shows results about outliers identification on Brazil's daily cases of COVID using MAD. For outliers related to lags on cases notification (upper peaks), the method applies a rolling window on data (red curve) with 10 days and median + 3 * MAD as a threshold (blue curve), the data values above this curve are labeled as outliers (black dots) (Figure 12(a)). It is important to mention that the threshold can only be computed until the final centralized window. For all data after this final window, the last computed threshold is used, that is why the blue curve is flat between xlast-5 and xlast. After the identification of peaks, these anomalies points were modified using a median in a centered window with 15 days to correct the weekday trend and permit detect the points of underreporting cases. For outliers related to underreporting daily cases, the rolling window applied has 10 days and median + 0.5 * MAD as a threshold enable detecting valleys points (Lower Outliers) for all values below the blue curve (Figure 12b). It is important to note that this approach seeks to determine the bulk of the data in a way that is not influenced by any outliers, where the tuning of parameters (threshold and window) aims to identify how much deviation from the mass of the data should be considered an anomaly and how far in time should one look to characterize points that not fit well with the data. The main advantages of this method are: simple and robust moving window outlier test over the data; the data do not have to be normally distributed and periodic; they don't have necessary to be positive.

Applying statistical imputation to handle with outliers
Whatever the domain of data considered: industrial, biological, financial, social, and health. All of them potentially generate data series that suffer from the same problem, the missing values (Moritz & Bartz-Beielstein 2017). The use of statistical methods to replace unknown, unmeasured, or missing data with a certain value is called data imputation. In general, imputation can be performed by replacing these data with the mean of the variable considered, although better results can be achieved with the use of methods that take into account the correlation between values of data series. Its application

PREDICTING AND TREND ANALYSIS OF COVID-19 CASES

is mostly used in surveys, but some computer experiment applications employ imputation to handle missing values NIST/SEMATECH (2013).
According to Moritz & Bartz-Beielstein (2017), time series imputation is considered a special sub-field of the imputation research area, where the main techniques like Multiple Imputation, Expectation-Maximization among others can't be applied directly, because they rely on inter-attribute correlations. While univariate time series (one attribute) use the inter-time correlations. An univariate time series can be defined as a sequence of single observations o1, o2, o3, ..., on on at successive points in time t1, t2, t3, ..., tn. The univariate time series is considered one column of observations and time is in fact an implicit variable (Moritz et al. 2015).
There are a lot of methods that can be employed to treat missing values using simple imputation like mean or learning approach like Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) Sorjamaa (2010). However, only since 2017 after imputeTS package of R proposed for Moritz & Bartz-Beielstein (2017), came into being an approach with algorithms considering time series aspects, because classical methods like mean imputation usually don't perform well in this context. It is practically impossible to point out a single method as the best in all cases, as performance generally depends on the intrinsic characteristics of the data. On one hand, data with a strong trend or seasonality perform better with methods based on Kalman Filter or Seasonally Decomposition/Splitting. On the other hand, sometimes imputation with mean values can be an appropriate method (Moritz & Bartz-Beielstein 2017).
In this context and based on the difficulty of evaluating the performance of the imputation algorithms for real missing data like ours (Figure 13), because a performance comparison can only be done for simulated missing data (Moritz et al. 2015). We adopted the StructTS9 pointed out by Moritz et al. (2015) as one of the best general methods in their research comparing various methods for univariate time series imputation in R. Another reason which guided our choose was the fact that this method presented the best result in a dataset with behavior similar to our data (no seasonality/with trend).

We have adopted the following steps to handle the anomaly values of COVID daily cases in Brazil: Step 1 - Apply imputation by next observation carried backward to fill the gap at the beginning of the time series;
9StructTS function implement imputation by Structural Model & Kalman Smoothing (Moritz & Bartz-Beielstein 2017).

LUIS RICARDO ARANTES FILHO et al.

PREDICTING AND TREND ANALYSIS OF COVID-19 CASES

Step 2 - Apply imputation by last observation carried forward to fill the gap at end of the time series;
Step 3 - Perform imputation using interpolation based on seasonal Kalman filter on a structural model (StrucTS).
The Kalman filter provides the means to update the state of new observations, where the state space form (SSF) is the key to handling structural time series. Basically, the state represents various unobserved components such as trends and seasonals. Forecasting is made by extrapolating these components into the future using state-of-art smoothing algorithms related to the Kalman filter to obtain the best estimate for missing values. Important to note that both prediction and smoothing depend on parameters which model stochastic behavior of variables have been estimated, these parameters called hyperparameters, are also based on the Kalman filter. The reason for this is that the prediction errors expressed in terms of one-step-ahead predictions from the likelihood function emerge as a by-product of the filter. The space framework provides a way to estimate hyperparameters carried out in the frequency domain besides allowing to modeling of non-linear effects and structural change (Harvey 1990).

RESULTS

Forecast Results for Country Groups

The forecast results concern the models that achieved the best performance regarding the RMSE score. The RMSE metric is applied to check the differences between the predicted values (Predictedi) and the true values (Truei) of the time series. It is calculated by the Equation 3 according to Willmott (1982).

The obtained results are described in Table III. We explain the most expressive results obtained in the evaluation of 288 prediction models for daily cases of COVID-19 in 12 different countries. The table III shows the best validation result based on the analysis of the RMSE score, the input days, the output days (prediction), and the combination of parameters that reveal the best and the worst results of the validation.
Description of results for the Critical Group: The results for Brazil and India are similar concerning the input and output parameters that produced the best RMSE scores in the time series validation. Brazil and India obtained as best prediction models those that received 15 days as input (as an object of Cause) and produced 20 days of output (prediction) (as an object of Effect).
The LSTM models for Russia and South Africa demonstrate similar indices in the RMSE score and produce the best result in the prediction for the next 15 days receiving as input days a maximum of two weeks. The results observed for the USA indicate the worst performance in the group, the model that obtained the best result allowed the analysis of 15 days to predict the next 30 days. Figure 14 shows the validation results obtained with the best performing models for the countries of the critical group on a linear scale.

Description of results for the Impact and Attention Group: For this group, we point out the results obtained for China, because the models are more suitable to the chosen parameters of the LSTM models. As explained earlier, the disease behavior can be observed on average in 5 days, and the effectiveness of control actions can be observed on average in 15 days with respect to the initial identification of the pandemic. The parameterization with the criteria explained in subsection "Parameterization of LSTM Models Based on Cause and Effect Criteria", allowed the development of a model with good performance in validating the number of daily cases, enabling the possibility of replicating these results for specific locations, provided that the environmental variables are understood and modeled. Also, the obtained result for China indicates that the efficiency of severe control actions strongly influences the containment of disease spread. For other countries such as Italy, Australia, Switzerland and Portugal, the results were similar, after a minimum of 10 days as input from the models to a 15-day average forecast. Figure 15 shows the validation results obtained with the best performing models for the countries of Impact and Attention Group on a linear scale.
Description of Results for the Successful Group: In this group, we point out the similarities between the countries and the results obtained regarding the validation of the RMSE score. Results for this group indicate that the model could identify the peak of the disease and the progressive reduction in the number of cases. Both South Korea and New Zealand have developed severe control actions to reduce new infections in the population. Thus, for every 10 days observed on average, prediction with

good model performance occurs between 15 and 20 days. Figure 16 illustrates the validation results obtained with the best performing models for countries in the successful group on a linear scale.
Observing these results indicates that the chosen LSTM models for daily case prediction are adequate when compared to the true values of the time series, as illustrated in figures (Figure 14, Figure 15, and Figure 16).
It is important to understand that each country presents a different behavior so that to obtain a better result for the validation of the models, a specific and exact parameterization of events in each country is necessary. Identifying the incubation period of the virus, the transmission rate, the time a person seeks medical care, and testing rate are all important tasks to modeling this kind of

In order to report the performance of the models in forecasting new daily cases of COVID-19, we have selected the models that had the best performance concerning the RMSE index. The selected countries include Brazil, India, China, and New Zealand, thus covering all three control groups. The benchmark values (updated values) refer to cases collected after the development of the models, thus considering new information in the system. In this way, the obtained results of the respective models are presented.

The further deployment of LSTM models for daily case prediction may contribute to the analysis of specific regions to understand the local evolution of infections. Easily interpreted and parameterized models allow several possibilities to develop and compare new prediction models.
In this paper, we seek to yield sufficient conditions to apply these models to regional data from cities, neighborhoods, villages, and regions to estimate accurately the epidemic behavior and new cases of COVID-19. The subsequent section indicates the application of this approach to several communities in Rio de Janeiro to observe model performance in predicting new daily cases of COVID-19.
LSTM modeling and forecasting results for favelas in Rio de Janeiro
By adopting the same setup made in the COVID-19 daily case forecast for countries, we have applied the methodology for regions and communities in Brazil. We have chosen a few regions, including the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Applying the case prediction models for favelas becomes a critical instrument to help us to adopt actions or policies that can mitigate the effects of the pandemic in the communities. In Rio de Janeiro communities only, COVID-19 has killed about 850 people with 7385 cases of infection until August 2020. In Brazil, the COVID-19 epidemic has killed about 600,000 people until August 2021.
The daily case data comes from the local health units, and all the information is available on the website Voz das Comunidades Voz das Comunidades (2020), the data started to be updated on April 10, 2020. This data comes from the following sources: Prefeitura do Rio de Janeiro, Governo Estadual do Rio de Janeiro, Clínica da Família Zilda Arns, Clínica da Família Pavão-Pavãozinho e Cantagalo, Centro de Saúde Escola Germano Sinval Faria - ENSP, Clínica da família Victor Valla, Clínica da Família Maria do Socorro Silva e Souza, Clínica da Família Valter Felisbino de Souza, Unidade de Saúde da Familia João Candido, Clínica da Família Anthídio Dias da Silveira, Clínica da Família Rinaldo De Lamare, Cms Dr Albert Sabin e Comitê SOS Providência.
The obtained outcomes concern the LSTM model parameterization explained before. To simulate a closer scenario to reality, we have modeled the environmental parameters observed in the favelas to infer the number of input and output days (prediction).

For countries that have controlled the COVID-19 evolution, in (c) we show the forecasting China, and in (d) we show the results for New Zealand in both countries, the predictions show a progressive growth in the number of cases.
Favelas are regions with high population density and low-income inhabitants. This pandemic reveals a phenomenon in which social isolation measures, such as lockdown, are impractical due to the social structure established in these places (Anjos 2020). The effects of COVID-19 in Brazil go beyond infections and are related to social inequity associated with the lack of jobs and of conditions that ensure dignity, food, and health (Boehm 2020, Anjos 2020).
According to Anjos (2020), people who live in favelas and do not fit into essential services, cannot practice social isolation because they have an extreme need to work to ensure their survival and provide resources for their families. Figure 18 shows the evolution of daily cases in the Rio de Janeiro favelas according to the collected information.

Figure 18. The different behaviors of COVID-19 evolution in Rio de Janeiro favelas, based on the time series of daily cases. (a) shows the entire series; (b) shows a window for the first 80 days since the first reported case, in this scenario it is possible to observe a progressive growth in the number of infections; (c) shows a window having an extreme peak of cases; and (d) shows a window that the time series presents similar behavior to the first 80 days, this shows that controlling the epidemic in the favelas is difficult, and this problem grows when there is an underreporting of cases and deaths.
According to Anjos (2020), 70% of favelas inhabitants had a significant reduction in their basic income due to the pandemic effects. Thus the need for survival surpassed any action to control the pandemic. According to (Boehm 2020) in Brazil 13.6 million people live in favelas, in a survey conducted by Agencia Brasil (Boehm 2020) these people do not feel confident about their safety or public health services.
Therefore, we adopt as input parameters a range from 5 days to 15 days and for the prediction a range from 5 days to 10 days. These parameters were adopted to allow a short prediction horizon so that the epidemic control actions can be made with more agility. Table IV indicates the results obtained in the prediction of daily cases of COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro favelas.
The best results were observed by introducing seven days to predict the next five days. The results show that the epidemic has a faster evolution and observing these events in 7 days is enough to predict the cases in the favelas more accurately. Figure 19 shows the results of the model validation for predicting daily COVID-19 cases in Rio de Janeiro's favelas.
To evaluate the performance of the prediction, we established a data input counting up to August 9, 2020. Figure 20 shows the result of the prediction for the chosen model indicating the true values of daily COVID-19 infection cases, the predicted values, and the values updated until August 25, 2020.

Forecasting for Brazil With Treatment of Daily Cases Anomalies
The main objective of this work was to propose an approach capable of modeling the different dynamics presented by the COVID pandemic in some countries and also in particular areas such as poor communities. In this context, one of the aspects identified is that the data referring to this disease may present inconsistencies such as delays (impounded daily cases communication) or seasonality on weekends. In this way, we intend to present a scenario closer to reality in terms of the reaction to

the situation of daily cases of COVID in Brazil using statistical methods for imputation of values, thus allowing a more reliable forecast.
Our data was handled with StructTS function from imputeTS package, this function employs the Kalman filter over a structural model (Figure 21), which enables considering trend and seasonal influences improving forecasting and even imputation results (Moritz et al. 2015). The methods based on the Kalman filter provide really good results for time series with a strong trend like our data of daily cases from COVID in Brazil similarly a common long-term observation for stock prices (Moritz et al. 2015, Moritz & Bartz-Beielstein 2017).

After statistical imputation, we use the adjusted LSTM model for forecasting daily cases in Brazil to compare with official data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health (Figure 22).
The results demonstrate that probably Brazil experienced a more dissemination of COVID than the official information presented, reaching a total of 3,572,551 at the end of July infected people against 2,992,600 official data. This situation can be even more serious since the data mentioned here

In (b) we show the same prediction under-treated data using the statistical imputation method. Here it is observed that the prediction results obey the time series regime, since the unexpected seasonality was treated and removed from the time series. Thus, we observe that the application of this statistical imputation method allowed us to produce a more reliable prediction that obeys the natural evolution behavior of COVID-19.
report only the number of cases officially confirmed through exams, the problem is that Brazil tests proportionally much less than most countries in the world10. The underreporting of COVID-19 cases can be up to 7 times higher than the official numbers according Ribeiro & Bernardes (2020), further aggravating the situation of the population in a situation of vulnerability, especially in the needy communities of large cities (The Lancet 2020).
CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we present an approach for applying RNN-LSTM models to predict COVID-19 in specific scenarios. We also incorporate adaptive linear regression analysis to detect anomalies and statistical imputation, with the aim of making the data more compatible with the complexity of each scenario. The forecasting models were investigated based on a set of criteria inherent to the stochastic dynamics of the pandemic (such as the behavior of society and government authorities in facing the crisis in

each scenario). Approximately 288 different prediction models were evaluated. We validate models in 12 countries, including Brazil and Favelas in Rio de Janeiro. We discussed the importance of this type of approach to help authorities with pandemic control actions, to more accurately and quickly predict new cases of COVID-19.
An important finding is that prediction models based on RNN-LSTM require careful parameterization in this context, avoiding random choice of parameters. Therefore, we have developed models that incorporate data quality assessment in each specific environment where the prediction of the daily number of COVID-19 cases is monitored (different countries and specific regions).
Eventually, we achieved the best forecasting results for the countries which showed the closest similarity to the established criteria of Cause vs. Effect. Regarding the prediction results obtained for Brazil, they also point to an evolution of the observed disease until August 2020, as can be seen by the predicted values and the updated values of the time series. Another important point is the application of these models to specific regions, as is the case of the Favelas of Rio de Janeiro. By developing the models, we have been able to verify the real situation of the favelas, providing support so that the competent authorities can act to control the epidemic. Our study also supports the prediction of cases of COVID-19 infection in small countries and regions with many social difficulties, poverty, and social conflicts in which vaccine distribution and humanitarian aid are extremely difficult.
We also emphasize that the parameterization and the models developed in this work can be applied to several problems that go beyond epidemiological situations and can also be fed by different sources of information, that is, two or more time series. Therefore, improvements to the methodology presented here are underway, also considering an update of the data for the different investigated scenarios. Given the stochastic nature of the daily cases analyzed, complementary techniques (e.g. Spectral Fluctuation Analysis (Veronese et al. 2011) are being incorporated to try to more robustly characterize the different scenarios. New results, including the high suppression rates achieved due to mass vaccination, which started in 2021, will be published further.
Although data collection and validation problems are common in the most diverse areas, this type of limitation and low quality of the information in health-related areas is extremely serious, as it directly impacts the safety and quality of life of each citizen. In the case of COVID data, incorrect reporting of the actual number of cases leads to a false impression that the disease cannot actually harm health in general. This denial view, partially imposed by low-quality data analysis, contributes to the growth of fatal cases as well as economic and geopolitical crises. Thus, our main purpose in analyzing the anomalous behavior of officially reported data was to shed light on a situation that potentially masked the true impact of the disease in the world, especially in Brazil, which has already been confirmed by other studies.
We provide all supplementary material on Github repositories. These repositories contain source code to predict daily cases of COVID-19 using LSTM network models. Basically, the package has a main module (core) and sub-modules with functions to tuning models and predict daily cases using time series data. The datasets are available at https://github.com/marcosmlr/docs_lstm_covid/blob/ master/DatasetsCOVID.ipynb and approaches at https://github.com/marcosmlr/lstm_covid.
Finally, it is important to highlight that the new strains of COVID (eg Delta), vaccination programs and the emergence of third waves in each scenario still pose major challenges for COVID prediction based on mathematical and computational epidemiological models, given the nature of such factors

are not yet fully known and incorporated into existing models. Highlighting scenarios in which the disease is expanding rapidly and its vaccination campaigns have barely begun. Such countries or regions often have outdated information and severe underreporting. Therefore, further studies are needed within a more specialist scope such as parameterization and the models developed in this work. This perspective must be considered within a scope that goes beyond epidemiological situations. In this context, the ecosystem that feeds the database to face the pandemic and its effects can and should improve substantially.

PREDICTING AND TREND ANALYSIS OF COVID-19 CASES

APPENDIX - LSTM BASIC CONCEPTS
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) applicable to classification and pattern recognition in sequential data and time series, such as voice, language, and textual data. Their data classification, clustering, and predictive capabilities come from the feature of allowing or not allowing the learning process in memory cells that are represented by connections among the neurons in the network (Gulli & Pal 2017, Manaswi et al. 2018, Vasilev et al. 2019).
RNN has a similar structure to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) (Goodfellow et al. 2016) network with the addition of loops and interconnections in the neurons of the intermediary layer. In this type of neural network, the learning of a given element depends on the previous elements in the data series. The figure A1 shows a simple RNN described with an architecture similar to the classic MLP network, however it is possible to check the interconnections and loops in the intermediate neurons. The recurrent layer has interconnections between neurons established in the same layers (Buduma & Locascio 2017).

Figure A1. Basic Structure of a RNN.
This architecture ensures that output at time {t = n} is dependent on inputs at time {t = n-1, t = n-2, ..., t = 1}. The training process is done by the backpropagation algorithm Goodfellow et al. (2016), if the data sequence is long there is the possibility of the function converging to local minimums or maximums, making learning slow and inefficient due to the simple architecture of the neural network, as pointed out by Manaswi et al. (2018).
Time series data applications require a more robust and improved type of topology that can take into account the input history. An RNN includes the ability to maintain internal memory with feedback and, therefore, support temporal behavior. The proposal of Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997b) called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, improves the classic RNN networks. LSTM

has been developed to deal with the problem of training convergence in large sequences of input data.
The LSTM networks try to establish relationships in data that have long-term temporal dependencies. This network includes memory cells in the intermediate layer (memory neurons) that hold information for long periods during training epochs. These cells are activated according to gates (g) (gate units) that control the information flux by activating each memory cell at a time, further details about LSTM Cell structure can be seen in Sak et al. (2014), Gulli & Pal (2017), Manaswi et al. (2018).
The recurrent connections add memory to the network and allow it to learn and take advantage of the ordered nature of the time series. The internal memory indicates that the output (prediction) of the network is dependent on the recent context in the input sequence and not the data that has just been selected as an input to the network (Manaswi et al. 2018).
There are several models and representations of LSTM networks to produce a sequence of predictions by a sequence of inputs, such of them are described bellow:
1. Model one to one: One input point generates only one output (prediction);
2. Model one to many: One input point generates N output points(predictions);
3. Model many to one: N input points generates only one output point (prediction);
4. Model many to many: N input points generates a sequence of N output points (predictions).
Figure A2 shows some LSTM models with different input/output relationships.

Figure A2. LSTM networks with sequences of inputs generating the outputs. In (a) we show a 1 to 1 model, in (b) we show the 1 to N model, in (c) we show the N to 1 model, and in (d) we show the N to N model. In this work, all the LSTM prediction models work as a N to N model.
In this paper, we try to develop an LSTM neural networks approach focusing mainly on the construction and parameterization of the models, checking how the models behave when time series data with several complex characteristics are applied. The models described at first subsections of Materials and Methods, featuring an N:N modeling (Figure A2), thus we seek to understand how the choice of inputs and outputs impact the predictive ability of the models. In this article, we also

point out that, for the validation of the predictions, the data went through a deep statistical analysis, verifying in each series possible anomalies that affect the prediction capacity of the neural networks.
We point out that all models, as well as access to data and anomaly analysis models, are available online for access by the scientific community and society in general (https: //github.com/marcosmlr/docs_lstm_covid/blob/master/DatasetsCOVID.ipynb, https://github.com/ marcosmlr/lstm_covid). Each model can be trained and validated via the Google Colab platform without the need to purchase more sophisticated hardware or tools, this kind of feature allows these models to be applied in places that do not have powerful and sophisticated computing structures.

Background: Exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause severe mental health problems, the dynamics of which remain unclear. This study evaluated the mental status of frontline health care workers (FHWs) and suspected infected patients (SIPs) during different periods of the COVID19 outbreak.
Materials and methods: Demographic and psychological data were collected through a cross-sectional survey of 409 participants in a hospital from 20 January to 7 August 2020. COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into three periods owing to the time, place, and scale, including the national outbreak period (a nationwide pandemic period from 20 January to 8 April 2020), sporadic period (a stable period from 9 April to 10 June), and local epidemic period (a local pandemic in Beijing from 11 June to 7 August 2020). Acute psychological disorders (APDs), including symptoms of anxiety and depression, were assessed using the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety/Depression Scale (SAS/SDS).
Results: A total of 206 FHWs and 203 SIPs completed the electronic questionnaire. Overall, the prevalence rates of anxiety and depression among SIPs were 3.9 and 19.4%, respectively, while significantly higher prevalence rates (17.7 and 25.1%) were found among FHWs, P-value < 0.05. Psychological status among SIPs did not differ significantly across the three periods. The FHWs were more vulnerable, as their SAS and SDS scores and almost all the dimension scores were significantly higher during the local epidemic period than during the national outbreak and sporadic periods (all P-values < 0.001). The prevalence of anxiety (34.41%) and depression (41.94%) was significantly higher during the local epidemic period (P < 0.001). Logistic and linear mixed models showed that age, sex, and doctor-patient ratio especially, independently influenced most dimension scores of SAS and SDS among FHWs (P < 0.05).

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) currently represents an unprecedented threat to human health worldwide (1, 2). The first cases of this novel coronavirus (3, 4) were reported in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. Subsequently, the virus was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) by the World Health Organization. The disease has a very strong infectious ability, such that it rapidly spread within a few months and finally became a worldwide health threat. The World Health Organization announced that as of 30 March 2021, 126,372,442 cases had been diagnosed, and 2,769,696 persons had died from COVID-19 due to the high mortality rate and lack of effective treatment (5). The primary routes of transmission include short-distance person-to-person contact, respiratory droplets, and aerosols. The pandemic has relentlessly affected normal social order, caused social panic, and seriously influenced public mental health (6), especially for those frequently exposed to highrisk environments.
Frontline health care workers (FHWs) are the most important force in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting public health (7). However, due to factors such as direct exposure to infectious individuals, a shortage of protective equipment, prolonged separation from family and friends, and even stigmatization (8), FHWs often experience acute psychological disorders (APDs), such as anxiety and depression (9-11). As early as May 2020, the International Council of Nurses reported that more than 90,000 medical workers had been infected with COVID-19. This figure is likely to be conservative because countries were busy combatting the pandemic. Studies (12, 13) have shown that during the outbreak of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), many frontline staff were infected in their workplaces, which often provoked their loss of emotional control and finally the emergence of APDs.

The effective control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan was followed by a short period of tranquility. However, the calm soon ended in June 2020 with a local outbreak in the Xinfadi Agricultural Wholesale Market in Fengtai District, Beijing. At this time, increasing numbers of medical staff devoted themselves to handling the drastically increasing number of suspected infected patients (SIPs). The state of the spread of COVID-19 worldwide is not positive. Such a serious situation requires not only effective treatment programs but also more medical staff on the frontlines to combat the pandemic. Although doctor-patient mental health is a concern among scholars, the periods covered in most studies are relatively short (3, 14). Therefore, this study investigated the dynamic changes in APDs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic among health care workers and inpatients over a relatively long period, with the main purpose of providing important evidence for psychological interventions.
Materials and methods
Study design, participants, and data collection
This study was a cross-sectional survey conducted from 20 January to 7 August 2020, to observe the different psychosocial status of FHWs and SIPs during outbreaks of COVID-19 (Figure 1). During this time, a total of 503 FHWs were sent to isolation wards to combat the COVID-19 epidemic, each of whom worked in a totally closed environment for 3 weeks. According to the COVID-19 prevention policy, 914 consecutive SIPs were hospitalized in the isolation ward for a definitive diagnosis. A total of 41% of FHWs and 29% of SIPs in our hospital during this period were sampled for the psychological health status survey. All the data were collected by questionnaire on a professional online assessment platform.1 Participants completed anonymous self-evaluation forms in the Mini Program provided by WeChat APP linked to the survey website using their own cell phones with each patient submitting questionnaire only once. The exclusion criteria included old age

epidemic in Wuhan was effectively controlled, and the number of local confirmed cases in Beijing remained stable, without a remarkable increase. This period was defined as the sporadic period. From 11 June to 7 August 2020, a new COVID-19 outbreak occurred in the Xinfadi Agricultural Wholesale Market in Fengtai District, Beijing, and the number of cases increased rapidly. This period was called the local epidemic period.

(80 years or above), blurred vision, communication disorders, illiteracy, non-use of cell phones, or refusal to cooperate. All participants were enrolled from isolation wards in Beijing Friendship Hospital, which is a third-level grade A general hospital in Beijing affiliated with Capital Medical University. During the COVID-19 outbreak period, the isolation wards mainly received patients with suspected infection from fever clinics. SIPs were screened by throat swab nucleic acid tests at least twice with an interval of 24 h. The results were reviewed by the team of chief examiners. If COVID-19 infection was confirmed, the infected patients were transferred to a designated hospital for further treatment. The other patients were released from the isolation wards. All the enrolled participants signed informed consent forms, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Friendship Hospital (2020P2-161-01).
The demographic characteristics included age, sex, area of residence (Fengtai District or other districts), education status (high school or below, bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctoral degree), marital status (single, married, and divorced), and number of children in the participant's family (no children, one or more children). Participants were classified into three groups according to the enrolment date: national outbreak period, sporadic period and local epidemic period (Figure 2). The COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan lasted from 20 January to 8 April 2020, and the number of local infected cases in Beijing increased during this period, which was defined as the national outbreak period. From 9 April to 10 June 2020, the

Assessment criteria
The symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed with the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety/Depression Scale (SAS/SDS) (15, 16). These scales have been widely applied in clinical practice and scientific research, showing good reliability and convincing results in the Chinese population (17-19). The SAS and the SDS both include 20 items, with each item scored on a scale from 1 to 4, indicating none or a little of the time, some of the time, a good part of the time, and most or all of the time. The participants responded according to their psychological and physical symptoms within the past week. According to convention in China, the threshold score of anxiety on the selfreported scale is 50. Scores in the range of 50-59 indicate slight anxiety, scores from 60 to 69 indicate moderate anxiety, and scores above 70 indicate severe anxiety. For depression, the cutoff score is 53, with scores in the range of 53-62 implying slight depression, scores ranging from 63 to 72 indicating moderate depression, and scores above 73 indicating severe depression.
Physical symptoms of anxiety and depression can manifest in multiple systems, such as the cardiovascular, digestive, respiratory, skeletal and muscle, urinary, and reproductive systems. The related physical complaints are often composed of factors in several dimensions. The SAS/SDS includes only the abovementioned physical symptoms. Therefore, the SAS/SDS is an appropriate instrument for dimensional analysis and theoretically supports the detection of the cause of mental disease.
A four-factor structure of the SAS/SDS (20, 21), which is generally stable and significantly correlated with relevant variables, was adopted in this study. The SAS contained four factors: anxiety and panic (items 1, 2, 3, 4, 18), somatic control (items 5, 9, 13, 17, 19), vestibular sensations (items 6, 10, 11, 12, 14), and gastrointestinal/muscular sensations (items 7, 8, 15, 16, 20). The SDS also consisted of four dimensions: core depression (items 1, 3, 6, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20), cognitive depression (items 10, 11, 12, 16), anxiety (items 4, 13, 15), and somatic control (items 5, 7, 9). Items 2 and 8 were not included.

with standard deviations (SDs) and analyzed by ANOVA tests among the three-period groups. Categorical variables, including sex, area of residence, education status, marital status, and the number of children, were described as frequencies (%) and analyzed by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Bonferroniadjusted tests were used for multiple comparisons. Univariate and stepwise multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate the factors influencing anxiety and depression status. All the collected characteristics were entered into the multivariate logistic regression models, and only significant variables remained in the final models. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated for each variable. Linear mixed models were used to calculate the influencing factors with the SAS score, SDS score and dimension score. SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.) was used for statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were tested at a significance level of 0.05 (two-sides).
Results
Demographic characteristics of the enrolled health care workers and patients
A total of 203 health care workers assigned to isolation wards during the COVID-19 pandemic period from January to August were enrolled and completed the survey. The demographic characteristics of the enrolled FHWs are shown in Table 1. Across the three periods (national outbreak period, sporadic period, and local epidemic period), there was no significant difference among the medical staff assigned to the isolation wards in terms of age, with most staff being approximately 30 years old (F = 0.724, P = 0.696). The number of female workers was almost double the number of male workers

(P = 0.801). The FHWs surveyed in the local epidemic period had lower education levels than those surveyed in the previous periods, with 34.41% of FHWs having a master's degree or higher vs. 54.10 and 57.14% in the national outbreak period and sporadic period, respectively (P = 0.011). The FHWs surveyed in different periods showed no significant differences regarding other demographic characteristics, including marital status, number of children in the participant's family, and area of residence. Notably, the workload differed significantly across the three periods and presented an upward trend. The doctorpatient ratio was only 0.75 during the national outbreak period and rose to 4.21 during the local epidemic period, which meant that medical resources were so limited that one doctor had to treat 4-5 patients in the isolation wards during the local epidemic period. A total of 206 SIPs in the isolation wards were enrolled and completed the survey. As shown in Table 1, the demographic characteristics of patients in the isolation wards were similar among patients surveyed during the national outbreak period, sporadic period and local epidemic period (all P-values > 0.05).
The psychological status of participants in the isolation ward during the COVID-19 pandemic
The psychological status of health care workers in the isolation wards was significantly poor during the local epidemic period (Table 2). The SAS and SDS scores and the scores for almost all the dimensions of the SAS/SDS, except for the second dimension of the SDS (P = 0.09), were higher in the local epidemic period than in the national outbreak and sporadic periods (all P-values < 0.001). The health care workers assigned to isolation wards during the local epidemic period had SAS and

SDS scores of 44.14 ± 14.32 and 50.53 ± 13.36, respectively, which were 8-10 points higher than the scores in the national outbreak and sporadic periods (Figure 3A). Furthermore, the proportion of health care workers with anxiety (34.41%) and depression (41.94%) was higher during the local epidemic period (P < 0.001). The prevalence of anxiety and depression in FHWs during the national outbreak period and sporadic period was 1.6 and 13.1% and 6.1 and 8.1%, respectively. The overall incidence of anxiety and depression in FHWs was 17.7 and 25.1%, respectively.
The psychological status of the patients in the isolation wards was stable overall (Figure 3B) and showed no significant

differences across the three periods (Table 2). The prevalence of anxiety and depression among the SIPs was 0 and 21% during the national outbreak period, 5.7 and 8.6% during the sporadic period, and 4.4 and 21.7% during the local epidemic period, respectively. The average incidence of anxiety and depression among the SIPs was 3.9 and 19.4%, respectively.
There were evident changes in health care workers' and patients' psychological status across the three periods (Figure 4). A comparison of the SAS and SDS scores of the patients in the isolation wards showed an approximately equilateral triangle indicating similar values in each period.

Factors influencing anxiety and depression among doctors in isolation wards during the COVID-19 pandemic
The multivariate logistic regression models (Table 3) showed that age (OR = 0.248, 95% CI: 0.068-0.905) and the doctor-patient ratio (OR = 2.434, 95% CI: 1.705-3.476) were independent factors of anxiety, while for depression, only the doctor-patient ratio was an independent factor (OR = 1.718, 95% CI: 1.369-2.156).
The linear mixed models (Table 4) showed that age influenced the total SAS (P = 0.011), total SDS (P = 0.029), F1 (P = 0.007), F2 (P = 0.011), F3 (P = 0.026), D1 (P = 0.038),

and D4 (P = 0.014) scores. Sex also independently influenced the total SAS (P = 0.030), F2 (P = 0.037), F3 (P = 0.040), and F4 (P = 0.049) scores. The doctor-patient ratio independently influenced most of the dimension scores, including total SAS and SDS, F1, F2, F3, F4, D1, D3, D4, and D5 scores (all P < 0.005).

of anxiety and depression among FHWs was 17.7 and 25.1%, respectively, which was significantly higher than the incidence among SIPs (3.9 and 19.4%). Furthermore, the occurrence of APDs in patients was basically stable during the three different periods, but the figures for FHWs fluctuated drastically across periods. The scores in the local epidemic period were

significantly higher than those in the previous two periods. In addition, age, sex, and doctor-patient ratio were independent risk factors for APDs. It is worth noting that the doctorpatient ratio was the strongest influencing factor for almost all dimensions of the SAS and SDS (only the cognitive dimension in the SDS was not related).
Theoretically, the closeness of contact with COVID-19 determines the risk of being infected and the degree of APD occurrence (22, 23). A recent study (24) based on 43 investigations showed that anxiety and depression were more frequent in FHWs than in non-FHWs. Previous studies (25) showed that anxiety and depression rates were 20.8 and 29.2%, respectively, in infected patients. Among FHWs, the anxiety and depression rates ranged from 38.5 to 44.6% and 21.7 to 50.4%, respectively (22, 26). In our study, the prevalence was consistent with previous studies. It was reported that the reasons for the higher prevalence of APD among FHWs were sociodemographic factors, current and past medical history, psychological and social factors, and job-related factors (24).
The brain is the central organ of stress adaptation that is responsible for sensing and judging the degree of stress and reacting accordingly physiologically and behaviorally (27). Acute and chronic stress can lead to imbalances in the neural circuits of cognition, anxiety and emotion, which in turn affect the physiology and behavior of the whole body through neuroendocrine, autonomic nerve, immune, and metabolic mediators (27, 28). Therefore, when the experience of tension and danger goes beyond the body's short-term adaptive capability, neural circuits become blocked, which results in mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression (28). This can explain why the occurrence of anxiety, depression and other psychological disorders was significantly higher

among FHWs than among SIPs and other groups. FHWs were continuously exposed to health-damaging circumstances (29), while SIPs could be discharged after a short stay in the hospital when they tested negative.
In the present study, we found that the doctor-patient ratio was the strongest risk factor influencing the occurrence of APDs among FHWs by affecting various dimensions of the SAS and SDS, including anxiety and panic, somatic control, vestibular sensations, gastrointestinal/muscular sensation factors, core

depression, anxiety, and somatic factors (20, 21). A higher doctor-patient ratio implied that FHWs had to care for and manage more patients. In addition, the high proportion of older individuals among SIPs meant that FHWs wearing protective clothing had to be more careful and perform more communication, medical documentation and complex treatments. Simultaneously, the increasing number of SIPs led to higher working hours and workload, causing FHWs to suffer higher psychological and physical pressures (30-33).

In the early periods of COVID-19, Chinese government and hospitals took effective measures to address mental health problems, for example, adopting the psychological protection measures provided by the International Guidelines for Psychological Crisis Intervention, establishing psychological expert groups in hospitals and creating network mental health consulting services (6). Necessary training regarding professional knowledge, mental health, and protective equipment can build the confidence of health care workers, help them overcome the panic linked to the pandemic, and reduce nosocomial infections, thus reducing the occurrence of APDs (23). Above all, the findings suggest that in the long-term fight against COVID-19, more attention should be given to the workload of FHWs, including the doctorpatient ratio, working hours, and night duty arrangements. In addition, the establishment of critical care isolation wards is particularly important.

One strength of this study is that it tracked the dynamic changes in mental health status among participants in different periods. As a result, it provided objective and reliable results regarding the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. A self-rating scale, the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety/Depression Scale (SAS/SDS), was adopted in this study. In addition, an in-depth dimensional analysis was conducted to show the main symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, several limitations exist in this study. First, the mental changes experienced by FHWs before and after isolation could not be followed up on due to the cross-sectional survey design of this study. Second, the convenience sampling methods and limited sample size might lead to selection bias. Third, the SAS and SDS have no diagnostic efficacy, even though they have been used in many psychological studies worldwide.
Conclusion
The present study reveals that FHWs have a much higher chance of experiencing APDs than do SIPs. Furthermore, the prevalence of anxiety and depression among SIPs remained relatively stable, while the prevalence among FHWs fluctuated drastically, with the highest incidence of anxiety and depression occurring during the local epidemic period. Analysis of the related risk factors proved that age, sex, and especially the doctor-patient ratio were independent risk factors for APDs. Our findings suggest that psychological assistance measures should be implemented not only in the anti-epidemic period but also before and after exposure to COVID-19. In addition, more concern and attention should be given to the workload of FHWs.

Aim: We examined the anxiety levels and coping strategies among sta and students of a tertiary educational institution during the COVID- pandemic and determined the association between anxiety level and coping strategies.
Method: Through an online survey, we used Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) to measure the level of anxiety associated with the COVID- crisis and Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE) to assess the coping responses adopted to handle stressful life events. Coping strategies were classified as adaptive and maladaptive, for which the aggregate sores were calculated. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the predictors of anxiety adjusted for potentially confounding variables. Results from participants were available for analysis.
Results: The mean score (SD) of the CAS was . ( . ). The mean scores of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies were . and . , respectively. Multiple linear regression revealed that maladaptive coping [Adjusted B coe cient = . , p-value < . ] and presence of comorbidities [Adjusted B coe cient = . , p-value = . ] significantly predicted anxiety.
Conclusion: Maladaptive coping and presence of comorbidities were the predictors of coronavirus anxiety. The apparent lack of anxiety in relation to COVID- and movement restriction is reflective of the reported high level of satisfaction with the support and services provided during the COVIDoutbreak in Malaysia. Adaptive coping strategies were adopted more frequently than maladaptive. Nevertheless, public education on positive coping strategies and anxiety management may be still be relevant to provide mental health support to address the needs of the general population.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is a serious global health problem that poses threats to both the physical and mental wellbeing. A meta-analysis found that the pooled prevalence of anxiety was 31.9% among the general population during the COVID19 pandemic (1). Another review indicated that anxiety level has increased 3-fold during the COVID-19 outbreak among the general population (2). The anxiety generated could be due to a multitude of reasons including the health risk posed by the virus on themselves and their families, the economic burden on themselves and the fallout at large (3), as well as the enforced social isolation during the pandemic (4). Anxiety is a natural response to stress. The symptoms of anxiety include nervousness, restlessness, fatigue and weakness, palpitations, trouble concentrating and insomnia (5-7). Significantly, studies have suggested that prolonged anxiety can reduce quality of life and weaken the immune system (8, 9) and as a result increases the risk of the SARS-Cov2 infection (10). Further, the restrictive measures imposed to curb the spread of the virus, and the associated changes in lifestyle and work arrangements, as well as the severe limitations in social and physical activities have exacted a heavy toll on people. Over an extended period of time, this could result in mental fatigue and stress. It is not surprising, therefore, that frequency of anxiety has been reported to be an increasing health problem arising out of the pandemic.
The pandemic situation that the world is facing now is not new, albeit, it is much more serious in many aspects compared to outbreaks in the recent past. Likewise, many people affected by previous pandemics have experienced and endured similar situational threats and stress at the individual level. During previous outbreaks, many studies have been carried out to address the issue of mental health and anxiety arising therefrom, and how people handle such problems (11-13). In these studies, it was demonstrated that there is an association between anxiety levels, mental resilience and coping styles (14-16).
With regards to teaching and learning, the seriousness of the current pandemic has led most educational systems to adopt online teaching modes, especially in higher education institutions, with all its challenges to teaching and support staff and to students. Transitioning from traditional face-toface to online teaching-learning can be an entirely different experience and/or challenge for both the learners and the educators. Regardless, this is a change that they must adapt to within a short time frame in the face of limited alternatives. They are compelled to adopt online platforms that they may or may not prepared for, depending on the expertise and previous exposure to information and communications technology (ICT) (17). It was pointed out by Doucet A, et al. (18) that the readiness of the staff and students to adapt to these changes needs to be assessed to allow for appropriate implementation of supportive measures. In the same paper, it was also emphasized that there is no one uniform pedagogy that can be applied

across all online subjects which, understandably, will be quite varied each with its own unique requirements both in terms of presentation and delivery of the subject matter. All these issues could present a significant challenge and stress for the entire university community (17). Lastly, there is the issue of equity in higher education, an example in case is students from economically challenged background who may face problems of affording online learning devices and/or reliable internet services (19). Essentially, both staff and students alike have to adapt to the changes in operational, teaching and learning modes, and at the same time cope with the uncertainties related to the evolution of the SARS-Cov2 virus, the course of the pandemic and thus movement restriction as well as their own infection risk.
As a result, questions on the psychological welfare of members of the teaching community has aroused the interest of the research community, hence, the numerous studies to address this issue. Islam et al. (20) reported that 18.1% (19) and Nayan et al. (21) reported 22% of university students from Bangladesh suffered from serious anxiety. Factors reported to be associated with COVID-19 related anxiety among Bangladeshi university students include lagging academic performance (19) and negative attitudes. A study on Middle-Eastern students from Jordan gave a similar prevalence of 21.5% (22); reported predictors of anxiety were chronic illness and, surprisingly, those with higher income. Yang et al. (23) reported that the prevalence of mild, moderate and severe anxiety among University students in Sichuan Province, China were 31.5, 8.1 and 5.8%, respectively, with medical students and those who paid more attention to pandemic information being more likely to be affected. Another study reported the prevalence of mild, moderate and severe anxiety among medical students in India were 41, 16 and 4%, respectively (24). A local study addressing the impact of COVID-19 related anxiety on mental health among Malaysian university students found that 30.5% experienced mild anxiety, 31.1% moderate anxiety and 26.1% severe anxiety; factors associated with anxiety included age over 20 years, Chinese ethnicity, decrease in family income, spending a lot of time watching COVID-19 related news and lastly, history of personal illness and of SARS-CoV-2 infection among friends and relatives (25).
The next question that would be expected is how people facing the stress and anxiety posed by the pandemic cope, and in what way the coping strategies adopted relates to mental health. A study from the United Kingdom (United Kingdom) found that both adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies were used, including socializing with loved ones, exercising, keeping occupied with work or studies, meditating and keeping positive, avoiding negative news on COVID-19, gaming, and taking alcohol (26). An online survey to examine coping strategies used among netizens, nationalities unspecified, found that a large proportion (68.9%) reported that they just hoped for the best, over half (53.2%), just kept themselves busy while around

30 to 35% used religion, or share their concerns with others (15). Mental disengagement was found to be the most common coping method used by university students in China to handle their anxiety; this was followed by avoidance and seeking social support (27).
With regards to the relationship between coping methods and anxiety, a study among nursing students showed that mental disengagement was predictive of moderate to severe anxiety and lack of humor predictive of severe anxiety (14). Another study done among Polish University students (28), reported that anxiety was significantly and inversely correlated with task-oriented coping style, while anxiety was significantly and positively correlated with emotion-oriented coping style and avoidance-oriented coping style.
From the above, it is apparent that literature on the relationship between coping methods and anxiety in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is generally lacking, both in numbers and coverage. Hence the attempt of the present study to provide some additional data on coping strategies used and their relationship with anxiety among the UTAR community of staff and students. We propose to determine baseline information on the frequency and level of anxiety in this study population, the predictors of COVID-19 anxiety, the frequency of different coping strategies adopted, and the association, if any, between coping strategy and anxiety. Indeed, to date, there has been only one study on anxiety and associated risk factors in Malaysian students (25), and none that address the question of coping strategies and their association with anxiety. Further, we observed that the WHO questionnaire (29) mentions multiple aspects which are deemed relevant and may have an association with anxiety levels, including compliance with preventive measures, satisfaction with support and resources, frequency of updating COVID-19 news, selfrisk perception, preparedness, and perceived self-efficacy, and unwanted behavior. Therefore, in the present study, we also explored these factors which are less often addressed in the literature, in comparison to questions on the associations with knowledge, attitude, and socio-demography.
Materials and methods
Participants
A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among staff and students of Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) City campus which consists of 11,541 members (administrative staff, n = 414, academic staff, n = 717; students, n = 10,410). All administrative and academic staff and students of UTAR in Sungai Long Campus were invited to participate in the survey which was conducted between September 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021. This study was part of a broader study which included other aspects related to the COVID-19 pandemic

such as knowledge, behavior, self-risk perception (probability, susceptibility and severity) and self-efficacy (protective and avoidance ability) (30).
Sample size was calculated using GPower 3.1 (Linear multiple regression: fixed model, R2 deviation from zero) (31). Assuming partial R2 of 0.05 (32), effect size (F square) of 0.0526, power of 0.95 and level of significance 0.05, with 18 predictors a minimum sample size of 250 was needed.
Ethical clearance and procedure
This study was approved by the UTAR Scientific and Ethical Review Committee (approval number: U/SERC/138/2020). Prior to responding to the survey, each participant was informed about the purpose of study, requested to provide signed informed consent and advised about the right to refuse participation and to withdraw at any time.
Instruments and scoring method
The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) was used to measure the level of anxiety associated with the COVID-19 crisis (33) and the Brief COPE to determine the respondent's primary coping styles (34). The CAS is a 5-items mental health screener with 5point Likert scale ranging from "Not at all" (score 0), "Rarely to twice or less" (score 1), "Several days" (score 2), "More than 7 days" (score 3), and "Nearly every day" (score 4) over the last 2 weeks. The total score ranges from 0 to 20. A cut-off score of  9 indicates dysfunctional anxiety (33).
The Brief COPE, an abbreviated version of COPE (Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced) is a 28-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess the coping responses adopted to handle stressful life events (34). It contains 14 subscales with 2 items in each subscale, rated by a four-point Likert scale ranging from "I haven't been doing this at all" (score 1), "I've been doing this a little bit" (score 2), "I've been doing this a medium amount" (score 3), and "I have been doing this a lot" (score 4). The higher the score of each subscale, the greater the likelihood for use of that particular coping strategy by the respondent. The 14 subscales in Brief COPE can be classified as "adaptive" and "maladaptive" coping methods. Adaptive coping strategies comprises the first eight scales which consist of active coping, planning, positive reframing, acceptance, humor, religion, using emotional support and using instrumental support. Maladaptive coping comprises the latter six subscales which include self-distraction, denial, venting, substance use, behavioral disengagement and self-blame (34). The scores for the adaptive and maladaptive coping were calculated individually and totalled for each participant; the respective scores were used separately in multiple regression analysis.

The World Health Organization questionnaire "Monitoring knowledge, risk perceptions, preventive behaviors and trust to inform pandemic outbreak response" (29) was used to determine the (i) prevention - own behavior, (ii) frequency of updating news on COVID-19, (iii) satisfaction with support and resources, (iv) self-risk perception (probability and severity), (v) preparedness and perceived self-efficacy, and (vi) unwanted behavior. Prevention (own behavior) was assessed by 10 questions [Scores based on a 7-point Likert scale, options being "Not at all" (1 mark) to "Very much so" (7 marks). The frequency of updating news on COVID-19 was scored based on a 7-point Likert scale [Options include "Never" (1 mark) to "Several times a day" (7 mark)], and satisfaction with support and resources provided with options being "satisfied" and "not satisfied". Risk perception was explored using three questions covering probability of contracting the infection, susceptibility to the infection and the severity of the illness if infected. Preparedness and perceived self-efficacy comprised two questions on self-protection ability and disease-avoidance ability. Scoring was based on a 7-point Likert scale. In both cases the scores for the individual items were summed to give an aggregate score for statistical analysis. Lastly, unwanted behavior was interrogated using 6 items [Options include "Does not apply" (score 0), "I don't plan to do that" (score 1), "I plan to do that" (score 2), and "I already did that" (score 3)].
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed by using the IBM SPSS Statistics Version 21.0 for Windows. Participants who failed to respond to any one item included in any scale were excluded from statistical analysis. For descriptive statistics, data are presented either as mean ± standard deviation to describe continuous variables or frequency (percentage) to describe categorical and numerical variables. Simple linear regression was conducted to identify factors associated with the coronavirus anxiety. Variables with p-values <0.25 were selected for further analysis using multiple linear regression to obtain adjusted B coefficients and their standard errors using the enter method. Variables with a p-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Further analysis was performed to determine if compliance with preventive measures, frequency of updating about the COVID-19 pandemic, perceived self-risk, preparedness and perceived self-efficacy, and behavior have mediating effects on the relationship between maladaptive coping and the coronavirus anxiety. This was based on 5000 bootstrap resamples and employed the PROCESS macro in IBM SPSS version 21 (35).

Results
Characteristics of respondents
Out of 11,541 UTAR staff and students being approached, 435 accessed the online survey and 434 consented and completed the online survey. The demography of participants which comprise 93 staff members and 341 students is presented in Table 1. The mean age of staff members was 36.6 years (range 19-74 years) and that of students was 21.6 years (range 18- 35 years), with females making up 67.7% among staff and 58.4% among students. With regards to the educational level, more than half (55.9%) of staff members had a postgraduate or professional degree and 88.5% of students were pursuing an undergraduate degree. Overall, 88.7% were single and 92.9% reported absence of any comorbidity. In terms of living arrangements, 73.7% resided within red (high risk) zones; just over 95% lived in household of 2 or more people; 35% of the participants lived in households with children and 32.3% in households with elderly people.
Compliance with preventive measures, satisfaction with support, frequency of updating information on COVID- , risk perception, self-e cacy and behavior
The majority (74%) were compliant with the public health measures recommended, more so among the staff members. Likewise, the large majority (82.5%), were satisfied with the support services provided, staff and students equally so. Just under 30% reported that they update themselves regarding the COVID-19 status very frequently (score 6-7), of whom about 10% do so several times a day (Table 2).
Coping methods
Brief-COPE exhibited good internal consistency in this study (Appendix 1); the Cronbach's alpha coefficient for subscales ranged from 0.576 (Planning) to 0.936 (Substance use) which is comparable to that reported (18). The frequency of response for the 28 items of the Brief-COPE are summarized in Appendix 2.
For analysis, the Brief COPE items were categorized into adaptive and maladaptive coping methods, following the recommendations of Meyer (2001) (36). Based on this model (Table 3), the proportion of respondents who use the various adaptive coping strategies ranged from a low of 12.9% (humor) to a high of 70.5% (acceptance); the average aggregate score was 35.7 ± 9.4. It is observed that about a fifth (20.3%) of the respondents used religion. The proportion of respondents who

frequently adopt maladaptive coping, with the exception of selfdistraction (33.9%), was quite low, ranging from 4.8% (substance use) to 10.4% (venting).
Further analysis was performed to see if there was any difference in the preference of coping methods between staff and students (Appendix 3). It was found that almost half the staff (49.5%) use positive reframing frequently as a means of coping compared to students (35.8%), a difference that was statistically significant (p = 0.016). A statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) was found only for the use of religion, with staff (36.3%) being more reliant on this mode of coping compared to students (15.8%). There was no

significant difference between these two groups with respect to the remaining subscales.
As shown in Table 4, the aggregate scores (average) for adaptive and maladaptive coping were 35.7 (55.8%) and 19.3 (40.2%), respectively.

Table 5 is a summary of the descriptive analysis of anxiety level related to COVID-19 according to the CAS scale. As recommended, scores ranging from 0-8 are considered to indicate low level anxiety while scores of 9 or higher to indicate high level anxiety or dysfunctional anxiety. The results show that 430 respondents (99.1%) had scores ranging from 0-8, of whom 261 (60.1%) scored zero which is indicative of the absence of any symptoms of anxiety (henceforth referred to as normal). The remaining 169 (38.9%) will be considered to have mild-moderate level of anxiety. Only a very small number of the respondents (n = 4; 0.9%) had scores that indicate the presence of dysfunctional anxiety. There is no significant difference in the anxiety scores between staff and students.
Predictors of anxiety
Based on multiple linear regression analysis (Table 6), the factors associated with coronavirus anxiety score were maladaptive coping [Adjusted B coefficient (standard error) =

4.106 (0.902), p-value <0.001] and presence of comorbidities [Adjusted B coefficient (Standard error) = 1.376 (0.610), pvalue = 0.025]. The mediating effects of compliance with preventive measures, frequency of updating about the COVID19 pandemic, self-risk perception, preparedness and perceived self-efficacy, and unwanted behavior, on the association between maladaptive coping and coronavirus anxiety were not significant (Appendix 6).
Discussion
This study aimed to determine (i) the coronavirus anxiety levels among UTAR's staff and students during the COVID19 pandemic, (ii) the coping strategies adopted, and (iii) the predictors of coronavirus-related anxiety, adjusting for potential confounding variables.

effects on mental health, both among the community as well as selective target populations. The reported prevalence of anxiety in the community varied from 31.9% (1) to 41.3% (37). An online survey among Malaysian university students, conducted during the first wave of the infection in early 2020 found that 20.4 percent reported minimal to moderate anxiety symptoms, while 6.6 and 2.8% reported marked to severe and extreme levels of anxiety respectively (35). In another cross-sectional survey conducted in China among college students in the midst of the outbreak in Wuhan, the reported rate of anxiety was 11.0% (38). In comparison, we found that 41% of our students experienced mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety (score of 1-8; CAS) and only 0.6% (score 9) had dysfunctional anxiety. The corresponding results among staff were 31.2 and 2.2% respectively.

Our study was conducted almost 1 year into the pandemic, amidst the third wave of COVID-19 in Malaysia. We found that a large proportion of the respondents in this study either reported absence of anxiety symptoms (60.1%) or mild to moderate anxiety (39.0%); only 4 individuals (0.9%) had symptoms indicative of dysfunctional anxiety. There was no significant difference between staff and students overall; however, the proportion of dysfunctional anxiety was higher among staff (2.2%) compared to students (0.6%). These results cannot be compared directly with those quoted; our study subjects are staff and students from a single privately run university in the Klang Valley in Malaysia. Secondly, the tool used for evaluation of the anxiety state is variable across studies. Further, the present study involves people who have gone through the initial wave of COVID-19 as well as several cycles of movement restrictions. Hence, the circumstances were also quite different. In addition, the university in question (UTAR) had been very proactive and had instituted relevant measures to inform, instruct, advice and support students and staff alike throughout the course of the COVID-19 outbreak. This is reflected in the high level of satisfaction with supportive measures provided. Hence, the relatively low numbers who experience dysfunctional anxiety. Nevertheless, the general consensus is that the pandemic has taken a toll on mental health and cause anxiety level to increase across all spectrums of society, albeit to different degree and extent.
Coping strategies

and uses a fairly standard scoring procedure; further, it is a widely validated tool with good psychometric properties. The subscales can be conveniently classified into 2 or 3 categories; in this study we divided them into adaptive and maladaptive approaches (36). The most frequent coping method used by the respondents was acceptance (70.5%), followed by active coping (45.9%) and positive reframing (38.7%), all of which are considered to be adaptive coping practices. These 3 subscales also fall into the approach coping category based on the approach-avoidant 2-factor model. Self-distraction, a maladaptive form of coping was also frequently used (33.9%); this, according to the approachavoidant model is an avoidant behavior. We note that the common models used for classification of coping styles are somewhat over-simplistic and that overlapping classification is frequent (39).
It is noteworthy that the proportion of respondents who frequently adopt maladaptive coping, with the exception of self-distraction, was quite low, ranging from 4.8% (substance use) to 10.4% (venting). In comparison, the proportion of respondents who use the various adaptive coping methods ranged from a low of 12.9% (humor) to a high of 70.5% (acceptance). It is observed that about a fifth (20.3%) of the respondents used religion, this is apparently more so among staff than students (p < 0.001); likewise, the use of positive reframing, an adaptive coping method (p = 0.016). It is acknowledged that coping is a rather complex process that is influenced by multiple factors underlying both the situational and dispositional coping responses. In this study, the situation underlying the stress posed is the COVID-19 pandemic and all its associated negative impacts, existential, psychological, social and economic. Overall, we observe positive coping in a relatively larger proportion of the university community, which we believe is related partly to the fact that, at least among staff, a stable job with an assured income and partly to the support that staff and students received from the university throughout the entire duration of the local outbreak to date.

The predictors of coronavirus-related anxiety
Multiple linear regressions indicated that maladaptive coping and presence of comorbidities are the significant predictors of coronavirus-related anxiety in this study. It is hypothesized that maladaptive coping strategies would lead to development of more prominent or severe pandemicrelated psychological symptoms. This was confirmed in a study that demonstrated a strong association between the use of maladaptive coping strategies and anxiety symptoms in relation to the pandemic (40); in particular, self-blame was found to be related to more severe anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. In another study of the Australian population (41), low scores in the adaptive coping strategies, acceptance and instrumental support and high scores in the maladaptive coping strategies, behavioral disengagement and self-blame, were predictors of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic. We did not find any significant association between adaptive coping and anxiety in this study. Some other studies have reported either the lack of or relatively weak association between adaptive coping strategies and anxiety (29-33). Interestingly, one of these studies (32) indicated that adaptive coping is associated with a higher level of subjective well-being, despite the presence of psychological disorders. However, we did not measure subjective well-being in this study, so we are unable to determine whether this is true in our case.
The finding in this study that comorbidities is a predictor of coronavirus-related anxiety is in accordance with that of a previous study (42) which found that people with underlying comorbidities are more likely to have high anxiety score than those without. This is not unexpected as it is widely known and accepted that people with comorbidities are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19; hence, the increased anxiety among this group of people (43).
Lastly, the majority of respondents indicated that that were compliant with recommended public health measures, and were satisfied with the support and resources provided by the

university during the pandemic. It might be surmised that this behavior and the satisfaction with support services are contributory to the very low frequency of dysfunctional anxiety and the relatively low frequency of anxiety symptoms among the respondents, staff and student alike.

via an online survey using universal sampling method. The Coronavirus anxiety scale used is based on reported symptoms of anxiety and provided only 2 classifications-- mild anxiety (score 0-8) and dysfunctional anxiety (score 9). The factors associated with anxiety were not examined in detail as the number of subjects who reported severe or dysfunctional anxiety was too few.
Further, it is acknowledged that the Brief-COPE instrument has not been adequately validated in the Malaysian population and so it is not known how well the latent constructs of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies translate to actual coping ability. Therefore, further validation studies with larger sample size and representative sampling methods are warranted, to allow for more in-depth appropriate and comprehensive analyses that may verify these findings.
We are also cognisant of the fact that during the pandemic, travel and social activities were extremely restricted. It is likely that many would spend more time on smartphones and the internet; appropriate use of smartphones and the internet could provide the means for handling the distress due to these restrictions (44). However, inappropriate use or overuse of the smartphone and internet, in particular to the extent of addiction could conversely exacerbate distress and coronavirusrelated anxiety (45). However, we did not capture the pattern of smartphone and internet use in this study; therefore, the results on this aspect should be interpreted with this limitation in view.
Conclusion
A high score for maladaptive coping and presence of comorbidities were the predictors of coronavirus anxiety. Dysfunctional anxiety among the UTAR community, a notfor-profit private university situated in the Klang Valley, Malaysia is very low at <1 percent. This is believed to be reflective of the high level of satisfaction with the support and services provided during the COVID-19 outbreak. With respect to coping methods employed during the outbreak, it was found that adaptive coping methods were used a lot more frequently by both staff and students. Nevertheless, the study has identified small numbers of people who practice maladaptive coping behavior which can act as prompts for appropriate action/intervention.

The development and administration of COVID- vaccines has been an

essential element in controlling the COVID- pandemic. However, countries

worldwide have faced challenges in planning and implementing vaccination

strategies. The aim of the current paper is to describe the situation faced by

small countries in the WHO European Region in implementing their national

vaccination strategies during the first stages of the planned roll-out (up

to May

). This paper uses information from the WHO Small Countries

Initiative (SCI), which includes a network of countries with populations

of  million (Andorra, Cyprus, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta,

Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, and Slovenia). The SCI countries faced

many challenges including: a lack of appropriate vaccination centers, adequate

workforce, and registration/booking systems to cope with the unprecedented

vaccine storage and administration demands; di culties for high-risk groups

(e.g., older individuals and those with health problems or cognitive impairment)

to access vaccination sites or use digital registration/booking systems; vaccine

wastage due to canceled appointments; and inequalities in vaccine uptake.

Innovative programmatic interventions were implemented to facilitate the

vaccination uptake of the populations such as: the creation of non-medical

vaccination sites and mobile vaccination units; on-site vaccination of people

in long-term residential facilities and long-term medical wards; diversifying

health workforce like redeployment of healthcare professionals and use of

medical students and retired medical professionals; campaigns with clear

information to the general public (in multiple languages where necessary)

both o ine and online; use of digital registration/booking systems and

alternative (non-digital) registration/booking systems for relevant individuals;

and administration of excess vaccine doses to non-priority groups to

avoid wastage.

Introduction
The public health impact of the COVID- pandemic
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been more than 516 million documented cases worldwide and over 6 million deaths with a large proportion in the WHO European region (217,646,171 confirmed cases and 1,999,825 reported deaths; data as of 13/05/2022) . People infected with SARS-CoV2 can present with a range of symptoms at different severity levels. In addition to the risk of serious illness and mortality, COVID-19 also poses potential long-term consequences for some individuals, such as prolonged respiratory, neurological, and cognitive symptoms (1-4). Alongside these risks, the health of population has been potentially affected as an indirect result of varied public health measures implemented by the countries to control the pandemic, such as social distancing and lockdowns, which have led to disruptions to routine medical care and management of non-communicable diseases, and increased risks for mental health (5-8).
Vaccination strategies against COVID-
Vaccination has been an essential strategy in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the first vaccine was approved for use in December 2020 by the European Medicines Agency over one billion doses (1,577,389,178; data as of 13/05/2022) have been administered in the WHO European Region . The initial vaccination roll-out was focused on delivering complete primary vaccination series to health and social care professionals and individuals with underlying disease conditions, which progressively was extended to other nonpriority population groups. As multiple COVID-19 vaccines became available at the end of 2020 and start of 2021, health systems worldwide struggled with varying challenges in implementing their vaccination strategies. Many countries continue to face repeated waves of COVID-19 and there have been ongoing fears of variants of concern; for example, in November 2021 the WHO designated Omicron as a variant of concern and, although little was known about the variant at that time, research subsequently showed that it is transmitted much more rapidly than other variants of SARS-CoV-2 (9). Further studies found that primary immunization with two doses of different vaccines (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2)

provided some limited protection against symptomatic disease, whereas booster doses substantially increased protection, which then waned over time (10). These points underline the vital need to continue to plan and implement vaccinations with short- medium-, and, long-term perspectives. Each country faces different challenges; identifying these difficulties and sharing the methods they used to overcome them are essential. Countries with smaller populations might have specific characteristics that affect them, such as differences in infrastructures or flexibility within their health systems. Evaluating how such countries handled vaccination roll-outs and describing both positive and negative aspects of the strategies may help for future planning.
Aims
The aim of the current paper is to outline the situation faced by small countries in the WHO European Region regarding their COVID-19 vaccination strategies during the first stages of the planned roll-outs (up to May 2021) using information from the WHO Small Countries Initiative (SCI), described later . The overall objective is to provide a commentary on the data and information about vaccine roll-outs in the SCI countries and discuss the perspectives of people involved in the process, including the key barriers that prevented vaccines from being as widely and quickly administered as possible. Specifically, we aim to describe the challenges that SCI countries faced in procuring vaccines, setting up vaccination sites, and administrating vaccines to different priority groups; describe the systems used for vaccine registration and vaccination efforts for the general population as well as for vulnerable groups; and share the methods that the countries used to address problems. General challenges will be discussed as well as issues faced by specific countries. Of note, this report was first created as a snapshot to describe the initial roll-out strategies (from December 2020 to May 2021) and does not reflect any new approaches undertaken in the countries beyond May 2021 like booster vaccinations.
Methods
The Small Countries Initiative (SCI), WHO European Centre for Investment for Health and Development, Venice, Italy
The Small Countries Initiative (SCI) includes a network of 11 Member States in the WHO European Region with populations of 2 million or less, comprising of 6 countries in the European Union (EU), namely Cyprus ,

Estonia , Latvia , Luxembourg , Malta , and Slovenia as well as 5 non-EU countries, namely Andorra, Iceland , Monaco , Montenegro , and San Marino . The Initiative was established in 2013 and the Secretariat is run from the WHO European Center for Investment for Health and Development, Venice, Italy. The objectives of this initiative are to leverage existing opportunities in small countries at the regional and international levels; share best practice in implementing relevant policies, strategies, and interventions; and build capacity in several high-priority thematic areas including practice-based evidence on ways to address different public health challenges. Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the initiative has created an innovative platform for collaborative sharing of knowledge and experiences related to the pandemic, including those that may create specific and unique problems for countries with small populations, which differ considerably in land mass and population density (Table 1) as well as in terms of single country negotiation and purchasing power.
Data sources
More information on the SCI and the 11 countries can be found on the respective official sites - . Vaccine coverage data was collected from the WHO/Europe COVID-19 Vaccine Programme Monitor (see text footnote 3). We present vaccine coverage from two time points: (i) epidemiological week 21, 2021, to provide a snapshot of how each country progressed during the first months of roll-out and (ii) more recent data from epidemiological week 18 of May 2022.

as the percentage of the total national population and include: (i) the first dose series of any product or (ii) a complete primary dose series of any product (i.e., receiving two doses of a two-shot vaccine or only one dose in the case of single-shot vaccines). Although the vaccination plans for booster doses are not discussed in the current paper, Table 1 also presents recent data on the number of booster doses administered, defined as the "total number of doses administered as extension of primary series or as a booster dose."
If not otherwise referenced, all other information comes from the COVID-19 Health System and Response Monitor (HSRM), national Ministry of Health COVID-19 websites for each country and interviews with country focal points in the SCI network up to 31 May 2021 via email correspondence and video conference calls, coordinated by two of the authors of the paper (LN and KP), see Table 2 for the structure of each survey. Data and information collected via the other sources were confirmed with each country focal point. There were different response rates from each country to the vaccination-related interviews and, hence, data and information completeness varies between countries.

Vaccination roll-outs in eleven countries in the SCI: Experiences, challenges, and solutions
Vaccination coverage
Table 1 shows the percentage of the population in each country who had received at least one dose or had completed the primary dose series of any vaccine by the end of May 2021 (epidemiological week 21). More than half of the population of Malta and San Marino had already received their first vaccine dose, while in most of the other SCI countries over one third of the population had received their first dose. In April 2021 the European Technical Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (ETAGE) recommended an interim vaccination uptake target of 80% of the adult population, as soon

TABLE Questions used as a base for email and video-call interviews with country focal points in the Small Countries Initiative.
General questions
Does the country have a National Vaccination Deployment Plan, NVDP, and when was it issued? What strategies did you use for vaccine procurement (non-EU countries), e.g., bilateral agreements, direct procurement, COVAX etc. What specific challenges affected the vaccine plan in your country? Did your country have already-existing vaccination centers (and relevant staff) that could cope with the vaccination storage and administration needs? If not, what strategies were used to address this? What digital health systems and tools were used in your country for vaccination booking or providing information to residents? Was there a specific strategy for reaching out to vulnerable/cognitively impaired persons who have difficulties using digital booking systems? Is there a specific initiative to administer excess doses to groups not currently in the "priority" categories (i.e., groups that are not yet eligible for vaccination)? Do you have any data on specific groups who have a low vaccination uptake (ages, socioeconomic status, ethnicity etc)? Can you describe any specific methods that your country used to overcome challenges to the vaccination roll-out?
as possible. More recent data from May 2022 (epidemiological week 18, 2022) demonstrates progress in terms of vaccination uptake, with almost all countries reporting complete primary series uptake in more than half of the population. Most SCI countries have also started administering booster doses as extensions of primary series and coverage is already more than half in Andorra, Cyprus, Iceland, Luxembourg, Malta, and San Marino.
Vaccine procurement
In the initial roll-out, one of the major challenges faced by the small countries were related to vaccine procurement. The 6 EU countries were part of the EU joint procurement of European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved vaccines. The non-EU countries secured vaccines using different mechanisms. Iceland signed direct agreements with AstraZeneca, Janssen, Moderna, and Pfizer. Andorra used methods of procuring bilaterally (with France and Spain from their EU negotiations) and from COVAX (Vaccine pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator), purchasing ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) vaccine against COVID-19 (AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine AZD1222) as a self-financing country. Montenegro procured through direct orders from vaccine manufacturers, through COVAX, and via bilateral and trilateral agreements with countries. San Marino's approach included a bilateral procurement with Italy, followed by a direct purchase of Sputnik V. As for San Marino, although the bilateral procurement related to all vaccines that were sent

Palmer et al.

. /fpubh. .

to Italy, it was agreed that only the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine would be sent to San Marino by Italy. As the Sputnik V vaccine had not yet been approved by the EMA or the WHO Emergency Use Listing Procedure (EUL), in May 2021 there was uncertainty over vaccinating frontline workers who commute daily between Italy and San Marino in terms of which country's National Deployment and Vaccination Plan should be followed.
Repurposing of existing facilities and sta for vaccine administration
Most countries lacked sufficient, appropriate vaccination centers to cope with the unprecedented demands and scale of vaccination, particularly in remote areas. The smallest countries (<100 km2), i.e., Monaco and San Marino, opened just one to two vaccination centers. Other countries temporarily boosted their capacity by repurposing other facilities as COVID-19 vaccination sites. All countries used vaccination centers, health centers, and other medical facilities as the sites to provide vaccination. Malta also created non-medical vaccination sites (such as university campuses, council offices, and military facilities) and Estonia offered vaccination in some workplaces and engaged mobile units. Due to a shortage of vaccination sites in some parts of Latvia, mobile vaccination units were deployed. Andorra required help from France and Spain to get sufficient amounts of vaccination materials.
Most countries, including Andorra, Cyprus, Iceland, Malta, and Latvia employed nurses and/or physicians to administer vaccines while Malta also involved medical, dental, pharmacy, and nursing students amongst others. San Marino engaged the support of retired medical staff to meet patients on arrival at the vaccination centers and process consent forms. Estonia created a free online training course for immunizers.
Vaccination campaigns
Vaccination plans were largely supported with poster and digital campaigns targeted to the general population informing them of which groups were currently eligible for vaccination and to encouraging uptake. For example in Luxembourg , clear campaign posters were created in multiple languages (Luxembourgish, French, German, English, and Portuguese), with specific information on the characteristics (age range, specific medical conditions, etc.) of people eligible for vaccination for each of the phases. Malta also had a broad communications strategy targeting the specific age groups through various media, and also pro-actively managed misinformation.
https://covid .public.lu/en/vaccination.html

Digital and non-digital registration and booking systems
Combinations of online and telephone registration and booking systems were used to facilitate the management of vaccine administration. By the end of May 2021, all countries had implemented some form of digital system for their vaccination services. These were used for registration, booking appointments, and/or joining waiting list via official websites, mobile apps, and telephone hotlines. Latvia and Estonia used interactive maps on their COVID-19 websites to enable individuals to search for the closest vaccination centers.
Initiatives were created to target high-risk and vulnerable groups who may have low digital health literacy or are unable to independently book their vaccinations, even by telephone, such as people with advanced age, serious illness, or cognitive impairment. For example, in Estonia, people in the priority group were contacted directly via their family physician. Andorra used records from local authorities to identify and contact people who were unable to independently book appointments. In Malta, persons in the high priority groups were sent appointment letters by post, whereas persons in the lower priority groups (i.e., <60 years) could register online or through a text messaging service. Latvia initiated a campaign of proactively calling individuals aged 60 years in less vaccinated areas of the country to inform them of the ongoing vaccination campaign and offer appointments.
In all countries, a major challenge was finding methods to vaccinate individuals with physical or health problems that limit their ability to reach vaccination sites. Individuals living in long-term care facilities or geriatric medical wards were usually vaccinated on-site by the institutions' staff or external healthcare providers, while people receiving medical care at home were vaccinated by mobile teams in Estonia, Luxembourg, Montenegro, and Malta.
Prioritization for vaccination to specific population groups according to their risk of being infected with SARS-CoV- or increased risk of COVIDcomplications

a large scale, all SCI countries devised a clear list of priority population groups in their National Vaccine Deployment Plans, with phases identified according to the risk of the population groups to COVID-19 infection. These included older individuals and those living in medical or long-term care facilities, followed by people with underlying disease conditions that could put them at a higher risk of adverse COVID19 outcomes. Alongside, healthcare and social care workers, especially those working with COVID-19 patients or within emergency medicine, were prioritized due to increased risks of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and potentially transmitting the infection to vulnerable patients.
Iceland , Andorra , and San Marino included specific employment groups, such as emergency services, prison, and education staff in their priority listing based on their local epidemiological situation. San Marino and Iceland , however, delayed vaccination of individuals with documented COVID-19 infection in the past 6 months while prioritizing others without any prior known infection.
Some countries lengthened the intervals between doses to aim for wider coverage of the population with a first dose. For example, in Luxembourg, the interval between the first and second doses of 4 weeks was changed to 8-12 weeks for the AstraZeneca vaccine and, in March 2021, the Estonian Immunoprophylaxis Expert Committee recommended extending the interval between the first and the second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine from 8 weeks to 12 weeks, and the interval between the doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to 6 weeks.

Extending the reach of vaccines to non-priority populations with leftover doses
Initially, vaccines were targeted to the high-risk priority groups, but many countries subsequently introduced systems to allow individuals from non-priority groups to register an interest (usually digitally) in receiving excess vaccine doses (e.g., in Andorra, Estonia, Luxembourg, and San Marino). When individuals from a higher priority group were unavailable or canceled a booking in Latvia, vaccination staff were instructed to administer excess doses to people from lower priority groups. Usually, individuals needed to demonstrate that they were able to reach a vaccine site

with short notice (e.g., volunteers in Luxembourg could register if they were able to arrive at a vaccination site within 20 mins). By the end of May 2021, San Marino began to offer vaccinations to tourists. In April 2021, nurses in Estonia who had been sent to vaccinate people at home because they were unable to leave their house for health reasons were authorized to also vaccinate any carers or other household members.

E orts to address low vaccine uptake
At the time of collecting information, the SCI countries had too few available data on the characteristics of people with low vaccine uptake but believed that there were cases of inequity in vaccine uptake due to vaccine hesitancy as well as differential access to information and vaccine sites. Estonia observed a particularly low uptake in older individuals in one county. In response, the authorities launched a "1 + 1 campaign" in April 2021, where younger persons would receive a vaccine if they accompanied an older relative, friend, or neighbor to the vaccine site (at that point in time, the younger age group were not eligible to receive vaccines). Latvia observed lower vaccination coverage amongst older individuals (over 88 years of age), possibly due to vaccine hesitancy and reduced access to information from national authorities. Montenegro reported that some regions had a lower coverage, but more research is needed to establish reasons underlying the low uptake.

Discussion
The small countries in the WHO European region faced many challenges during the first 6 months of the COVID19 vaccine roll-out. In addition to public health measures, vaccination has been an essential element to control the COVID19 pandemic, and the subsequent introduction of vaccine certificates in the EU and elsewhere helped to open countries up and allow people to travel with reduced COVID-19 risks. Nevertheless, there are substantial challenges in terms of short-, medium-, and long-term planning. Most countries have now faced multiple waves of COVID-19 and several variants of concern have raised new threats. Many countries worldwide are now vaccinating younger age groups but in order to have a wider impact with the available vaccines, it is prudent that the focus should remain on the high-risk vulnerable population groups

for both primary series and booster doses. The evolving nature of changes in strategies and target groups require immense planning and the current article may provide practical insight into how smaller countries could address potential issues in the future. Research is ongoing to assess the duration of immunity following vaccination, and their efficacy against variants of concern. In May 2021, Monaco's SCI country focal point reported that they had initiated a project to assess antibody levels in the general population post-vaccination (after 1, 6, 12, and 24 months), which may contribute to the ongoing body of evidence.
The strength of the current study is that we were able to interview country focal points via video conferencing to gain first-hand perspectives on examples of good practice as well as challenges in the vaccine roll-outs in the SCI countries. This, combined with details of specific aspects of the rollsout and strategies undertaken by each country, provides a relevant description of the challenges that small countries faced during the initial stages, and these are in line with findings from other studies in the literature that have compared small states and islands in Europe. One paper comparing the impact of COVID-19 in six European microstates (Andorra, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City) discussed how vaccination roll-outs were key in containing the pandemic, and described how all countries except Malta (which benefitted from the EU joint procurement) had to find different ways to procure vaccines from adjacent nations or directly from manufacturers (11). Another article comparing different vaccination roll-out speeds between Cyprus and Malta (12) highlighted that, although the two islands share similar demographic characteristics, formed part of the EU advanced vaccination purchase agreement, and had similar vaccine strategies, there was a slower roll out in Cyprus that may have been due to vaccine hesitancy, differences in the vaccine registration systems, and the fact that individuals could choose which vaccine brand to take. Low vaccination hesitancy and high vaccine doses have been proposed as the major factors underlying Malta's rapid vaccination roll-out (13). However, despite this, Malta experienced higher COVID-19 infection and mortality rates during the second waves, compared to other European island states with small populations (Cyprus and Iceland), emphasizing that vaccine roll-out is not the only factor needed to contain the pandemic, as restrictive measures and governance approaches also play an important role (14).
Some limitations deserve mention. First, this paper provides a description of how the SCI countries rolled out their vaccines in the initial stages and does not reflect on the subsequent phases such as the planning for booster dose administration. The COVID-19 pandemic is a fast-changing situation, with new waves and variants emerging, and what we know about treatment, vaccination, prevention, and long-term effects is

constantly changing. Therefore, this article should be looked at as snapshot of the initial stages to better understand how well small countries in the WHO European Region were able to cope and adapt to this unprecedented challenge.
In conjunction with planning the practical aspects of ongoing and future vaccination strategies, it is essential to develop interventions to increase vaccination uptake in specific population groups who are hesitant and to assess the effectiveness of such initiatives. Within the SCI, we further plan to establish whether there have been geographical limitations due to land mass or population density in the small countries, particularly any challenges related to urban vs. rural locations. It is also relevant to understand how effective digital tools have been in vaccination monitoring, allocation, and booking in the small countries as well as which population groups need alternative non-digital booking and monitoring systems and how they can be adapted to suit their needs. The SCI will continue to examine such questions during the upcoming months within the domain of the ongoing threat of the COVID19 pandemic.

The COVID- pandemic has dramatically changed healthcare personnel's

working environment and sense of security. Medical laboratory scientists

were also faced with new occupational challenges. They were tasked with

performing novel tests for SARS-CoV- without being aware of the associated

risks. At the beginning of the pandemic, strict sanitary requirements and the

fear of becoming infected with the "new virus" were considerable sources

of stress. However, these stress responses abated over time. The aim of this

two-stage study was to explore the extent to which this group of medical

professionals adapted to new working conditions year after the outbreak

of the pandemic. The study was conducted at the beginning of the fourth

pandemic wave in Poland, i.e., between September and October

.

The first stage was a pilot study that involved interviews with medical

laboratory scientists. The results were used to perform a survey of

laboratory scientists in the second stage. The study investigated the problems

and fears faced by this professional group at the beginning of the pandemic,

as well as changes in their attitudes during successive waves of COVID- .

The analyzed data demonstrated that most medical laboratory scientists had

grown accustomed to the pandemic and workplace changes by the beginning

of the fourth wave. The study also indicates that in addition to adequate

means of personal protection, health professionals should also be provided

with emotional support in times of pandemic.

Introduction
In late 2019, the world's eyes were on China and the increasingly worrying reports on the emergence of a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It soon became apparent that SARS-CoV-2 was the cause of the global COVID-19 pandemic which paralyzed the entire world (1, 2). The first case of

SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in Poland on 4 March 2020. As of that date, medical personnel found themselves in a new and uncertain reality that posed numerous challenges. Physicians, nurses, and emergency medical services came into direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Medical technologists and other laboratory personnel were tasked with analyzing biological specimens to identify patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
The pandemic elicited strong emotions in the medical community. Medical professionals were highly motivated to fight the new enemy, help patients and save lives, but at the same time, they were afraid of becoming infected and transmitting the disease to their families. In addition to psychological stress, medical personnel had to deal with a deficiency of personal protective equipment (PPE), staff shortages, overwhelming fatigue and disinformation. Medical professionals are exposed to pathogens on a daily basis, and they are particularly susceptible to infections. Advanced PPE is needed to create a safe and effective work environment for medical personnel (3). However, according to the official data published by the Polish Ministry of Health, 81,844 nurses, 32,872 physicians, 13,410 physiotherapists, 8,416 midwives, 4,616 pharmacists, 4,116 paramedics, 3,986 dentists, and 3,146 laboratory scientists became infected with SARS-CoV-2, whereas 251 physicians, 201 nurses, 24 midwives, 22 pharmacists, seven physiotherapists, seven paramedics, and five laboratory scientists died due to COVID-19 between the beginning of the pandemic and 5 December 2021, despite the fact that strict protective measures had been put into place (4).
Medical laboratory scientists also bore the brunt of the health disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Until recently, this relatively small group of medical professionals has been largely neglected in public discourse. Medical technologists performing laboratory analyses remain largely anonymous, and very few people are aware that the results of diagnostic tests influence more than 70% of medical decisions (5). During the pandemic, this group of healthcare workers stepped out of the shadow because medical laboratories were tasked with performing thousands of PCR tests to confirm SARS-CoV2 infections. The public and the authorities became aware that laboratory personnel play a crucial role in healthcare. Special guidelines were issued for dealing with specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing, as well as all biological samples collected from patients with confirmed or suspected COVID19. Similarly to other medical personnel, laboratory scientists became overwhelmed by the immense burden of COVID-19 and rigorous sanitary measures, but they rose to the challenge. This study had been conducted before pandemic restrictions were lifted, but by that time, medical workers' emotional responses to the health crisis clearly differed from their attitudes at the beginning of the pandemic (5, 6).
The main research question was: to what extent have laboratory technologists' attitudes to work-related hazards

changed between 11 March 2020 [when the WHO declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic (7)] and October 2021 (which marked the beginning of the fourth wave in Poland). We tested the research hypothesis postulating that medical laboratory scientists had gradually adapted to dangerous working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in attitudes toward occupational hazards were analyzed among laboratory scientists who were and were not responsible for testing biological specimens for SARS-CoV-2.
The emotional well-being of medical staff during the pandemic has been widely researched around the world. However, the problems associated with the quality of the work environment, new duties and challenges have not been analyzed in detail to date (8-14). Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the ways in which medical laboratory scientists adapted to the new reality. The results were used to formulate recommendations for creating a safe work environment in dangerous circumstances.
Materials and methods
The study was conducted between 10 September and 31 October 2021 in two stages: fist pilot stage (qualitative, based on in-depth interviews) and second stage (quantitative, based on on-line questionnaire).
Mixed methods design was used for the study (15). On the first stage (pilot study) qualitative method - face-to-face in-depth interview - was used to explore and obtain depth of understanding of the research area related to the work of the respondents. The main research questions of the pilot phase and overall study were: (1) what challenges accompanied the work of diagnosticians during a pandemic, and (2) how these challenges changed with the changing situation and progressive adaptation.
On the second stage, quantitative method (on-line questionnaire) were used to test and confirm hypotheses based on the obtained knowledge from the first stage (16).
Medical laboratory scientists employed in both public and private laboratories participated in both stages of the study.
The first stage of the study was a qualitative pilot study that involved 14 laboratory scientists from the Polish Region of Warmia and Mazury. The respondents were selected by purposeful sampling. The research consisted in conducting faceto-face in-depth interviews with selected people. The interviews was based on the standardized questionnaire containing 10 open questions about: type of work, workplace experience at the beginning of the pandemic and on the day of the survey, emotional responses during the pandemic, sense of being appreciated, sense of security, and the main concerns. The interviews lasted from 20 to 45 min. Upon the participants' consent, the interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded following content analysis aimed at identifying the frequencies of data and themes. Obtained responses were divided into

categories and the main problems and became categories for the nation-wide quantitative survey. The laboratory scientists interviewed in the first stage of the study are characterized in Table 1.
The participants for the second stage of study (quantitative survey) were selected by purposeful sampling. The subjects received a link to an online questionnaire by e-mail and were asked to forward the link to their colleagues (snowball sampling). A total of 294 medical laboratory scientists participated in the study. The majority of the participants did not have specialty training (67.3%) and were employed in public hospital laboratories (52%). The population investigated in the second stage of the study is characterized in Table 2.
The questionnaire comprised 18 questions in the following categories: demographic data, type and place of work, working conditions, work during the COVID-19 pandemic (battery of 14 subcategories on Likert's scale), psychological support, emotions (battery of seven subcategories on Likert's scale), problems with

professional performance during the pandemic, sense of being appreciated by various social groups, perceptions of risk, workrelated fears at the beginning of the pandemic and on the day of the survey (two questions with seven subcategories), vaccination, and current challenges.
The obtained data from the nation-wide quantitative survey were processed with the use of the IBM SPSS Statistics 27 software platform. The correlations between the variables were assessed by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient.
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland (approval No. 3/2022).
Results
New challenges and adaption
The detailed objective of the pilot study was to identify new challenges facing medical technologists during the health crisis. It should be noted that the study was conducted 1 year after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the participants were able to reflect on their experiences and emotions at the beginning of the pandemic and compare their initial attitudes and feelings with those reported on the day of the survey. Based on the interviews (1st qualitative stage), the following categories were distinguished as shown in Figure 1.
The categories from the interviews were converted into questions in the quantitative survey. The introduction of a strict sanitary regime at the beginning of the pandemic was recognized as the most severe problem by 95.5% of the surveyed subjects. The lack of reliable information, recommendations and guidelines for medical laboratory personnel was identified as a significant problem by 79.9% of the respondents.
Other adverse consequences of the COVID-19 crisis included: (1) increased workload (84% of the respondents who tested biological specimens for SARS-CoV-2; 69% of the respondents who did not perform such tests), (2) longer working hours (59.2 and 44%, respectively), and (3) additional work shifts (52.5 and 25%, respectively). All of the above factors significantly (p < 0.001) affected medical laboratory scientists who tested biological specimens for the virus, which implies that this group was more influenced by the adverse changes in the workplace.
The health crisis was a major cause of stress, but the studied subjects did not report emotional disorders such as depression, insomnia, or despair. At the beginning of the pandemic, 80.3% of the respondents had a fear of becoming infected or transmitting the virus to their families (86%). However, no significant differences were found between medical laboratory scientists who had and had not tested specimens for SARS-CoV-2.
The study tested the research hypothesis postulating that medical laboratory scientists had gradually adapted to dangerous working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. And

indeed medical scientists fears and discomfort abated over time. The respondents did not struggle with psychological issues (depression, insomnia, despair) during the pandemic and did not experience intense stress or fear, which could be attributed to the fact that unlike front line medical personnel, most laboratory scientists do not come into direct or prolonged contact with patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. It should also be noted that 34% of the respondents had not directly analyzed clinical specimens, i.e., they had not tested respiratory tract samples which are most infectious.
Despite the above, the majority of the surveyed subjects (66%) were of the opinion that psychological assistance would enable them to better cope with work-related stress. However, only 8 out of the 294 analyzed respondents had received such assistance.
When asked about their experiences and emotions at the beginning of the pandemic and one year into the crisis, the surveyed scientists were of the opinion that they had largely adapted to the new situation: they reported lower levels of fatigue (decrease of 3%), less stress associated with health safety protocols (decrease of 7%), and staff shortages (decrease of 14%). The percentage of medical laboratory scientists who had adapted to the health crisis increased from 4% at the beginning of the pandemic to 19% on the day of the survey (Table 3; Figure 2).
Social recognition and gratitude for medical laboratory personnel
Social recognition of medical laboratory personnel was a frequently raised issue during in-depth interviews in the first stage of the study. According to one of the respondents, "our work is still not appreciated by our superiors or the

government." Medical laboratory scientists have received greater praise from the public, "but we still work in the shadow of other medical professions. People feel more grateful to physicians and nurses" [B.1].
According to the surveyed subjects, the attitudes toward laboratory professionals have changed during the pandemic as more people became aware of their role in combatting the health crisis. "Before the pandemic, most people had no clue about laboratory work. This has changed because during the pandemic, people turned to us for advice about COVID19 and screening tests" [B.8]. However, many respondents continue to experience a deep sense of injustice: "Our work is not recognized by our superiors, the government or the public. Only we are aware the extent to which our efforts have contributed to ending the pandemic" [B.3]. Similar sentiments were expressed by all participants. One of the respondents said: "I have been praised for my work, and I have been told that the hospital would have to close without our input, and that laboratory technologists are the driving force toward

combating the crisis. We received bonuses from the government in recognition of our hard work. When it comes to social gratitude, my family definitely appreciate what I do, and they are proud of me. The medical technologist's profession has gained some recognition during the pandemic. Most people think that lab tests are done by nurses, and perhaps the pandemic has raised awareness levels. Still, this is not enough" [B.9]. However, growing levels of social awareness also prompted some people to fear medical laboratory scientists during the pandemic. "I don't know if our work is more appreciated. Some neighbors who know where I work would run away as soon as they saw me" [B.10].
The quantitative survey in the second stage of the study confirmed that laboratory technologists felt largely undervalued (Figures 3-5). When asked whether they had received due

recognition from their superiors during the pandemic, 59.2% (174) of the respondents answered in the negative, and only 13.3% (39) replied in the affirmative, whereas the remaining subjects (27.6%, 81) were undecided ("hard to say"). The respondents felt even more neglected by the authorities: 84.4% (248) did not feel appreciated, 10.2% (30) were undecided, and only 5.4% (16) felt appreciated. In the pilot survey, most of the respondents argued that they had received recognition mainly from their public, but these observations were not confirmed in the second survey conducted on a larger population. In the second survey, the majority of medical laboratory scientists claimed that "nothing has changed" (70.4%, 207); 7.5% (22) were of the opinion that their work was more appreciated, whereas the remaining participants (22.1%, 65) were undecided.
At the end of presenting the results, it should be mentioned that one of our initial assumptions has not been confirmed, that work that involved testing biological specimens for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was the main variable differentiating the examined population. In stage two of the study (nationwide quantitative survey), most of the participants (66%) had tested biological specimens for the virus, whereas 34% of the respondents had not performed such tests. However, the statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in feelings of discomfort or low mood between these groups. The new situation posed a considerable challenge for both groups of participants who did not differ significantly in their emotional attitudes. The analyzed grouped differed significantly only in their attitudes toward an increased workload, and this problem was significantly (p < 0.001, Pearson's correlation) more often reported by medical laboratory scientists who tested biological specimens for SARS-CoV-2. This observation could be explained by the fact that both groups had similar attitudes to the examined problems in an increased sanitary regime. Due to the absence of significant differences, the division of the studied population into two groups was abandoned, and successive analyses were conducted based on descriptive statistics.
Discussion
This study was conducted to investigate the emotions and fears experienced by laboratory staff at the onset of the pandemic, and the extent to which these feelings changed in the course of the pandemic.
Healthcare professionals, including physicians, nurses, paramedics, and laboratory scientists, are indispensable in the process of treating COVID-19 infections. Medical personnel are more susceptible to COVID-19 than the general population because they come into direct contact with infected individuals and biological specimens collected from patients. Increased workload under immense pressure, fear of infection, and staff

shortages contribute to burnout and mental health issues in healthcare professionals (3).
Pappa et al. (10) and Wu et al. (8) conducted metaanalyses of more than 80 research studies performed around the world and reported a growing incidence of emotional problems, including depression, insomnia, despair, and anxiety, in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. These problems were most prevalent in medical employees who came into direct contact with patients, i.e., physicians, nurses, and paramedics (17).
There is a general scarcity of reliable data that could confirm or rule out the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 through contact with an infected patient's blood or urine. Viremia was reported in 15% of the first COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, but the risk of viral transmission to medical personnel, including medical laboratory scientists, was evaluated as low if adequate security protocols and PPE were applied (18). Genetic and antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 are performed in laminar flow cabinets, and laboratory technologists wear PPE, which significantly reduces the risk of infection. According to the surveyed medical laboratory scientists, the availability of PPE was low in the 1st months of the pandemic, but it improved gradually over time (13, 18, 19).
The implementation of a strict sanitary regime was a source of significant distress and discomfort for more than 90% of the studied population. Prolonged use of PPE and disinfectants can contribute to allergies, in particular respiratory and skin allergies, allergic conjunctivitis, and acute generalized allergic reactions. These conditions are classified as occupational diseases. Research into the use of PPE during a previous SARS epidemic in Singapore revealed adverse skin reactions in medical personnel wearing N95 masks (35% of users) and protective gloves (21% of users) (20). In a Polish study analyzing hand skin problems in laboratory technologists, 98% of the surveyed subjects reported allergies and rashes after prolonged use of protective gloves and disinfecting agents (21).
Some researchers have argued that the COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 should be classified as an occupational disease resulting from exposure to harmful agents in the workplace or associated with the performed duties. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the USA developed a classification system for assessing the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace. According to the proposed classification, healthcare workers (including physicians, nurses, dentists, and paramedics) and medical laboratory scientists who collect and/or analyze samples from patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at very high risk of contracting the disease (22). The described classification system also states that workers at high risk of COVID-19 infection, including physicians, nurses, paramedics, as well as laboratory scientists, should receive psychological support (23- 26). These types of solutions have been implemented in some Chinese and Italian hospitals (27). Support schemes targeting

not only frontline personnel, but all medical sector employees would also considerably benefit healthcare professionals in Poland. Medical laboratory scientists have adapted to the pandemic, but the risk of new SARS-CoV-2 mutations or pandemics caused by new pathogens causes a lot of uncertainty about the future. It should be noted that the respondents did not worry only about their health and lives. They also voiced concerns about the Polish economy (36.9%), the possibility of successive lockdowns (23.8%), low levels of preparedness in the public healthcare system (21.1%), and new virus mutations. These results indicate that medical laboratory scientists, as well as other healthcare professionals, are not only self-preoccupied and have more cause for concern than the representatives of non-medical professions.
The main strength of this study is that it makes the first ever attempt to analyze medical laboratory workers' adaptation to new working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic and focuses mainly on their emotional well-being. The present findings probably also apply to other healthcare professionals. It is worth noting that the study involved a nationwide survey. The limitations include the fact that the first stage of the study involved only medical laboratory scientists working in various health care units, but in the same city.
Conclusions
Medical laboratory scientists have gradually adapted to their work environment in a new reality during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to 34% of the respondents, their sense of security increased in successive months of the pandemic. According to 24% of the surveyed subjects, their anxiety was considerably alleviated by the introduction of the vaccination program at the beginning of 2020. However, nearly 20% of the analyzed laboratory technologists felt "pressured" to become vaccinated. The vaccination rate in this professional group was estimated at 90% (27), which indicates that a large number of laboratory scientists received the vaccine despite personal beliefs.
At the beginning of the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland, medical laboratory scientists' concerns did not focus solely on their professional duties. They had to deal with strong emotions, as well as concerns about their health and families. At present, they are concerned mainly about the Polish economy. These results confirm that Polish medical laboratory scientists have largely adapted to the new reality.
Recommendations
Based on the results of the present study, the following recommendations can be formulated to improve the performance of medical laboratory scientists who faced

considerable pressure and uncertainty in a difficult and changing work environment during the COVID-19 pandemic: - training on effective communication with patients to reduce
stress and fatigue, - training on the use of PPE to avoid infection, - training on the use of computer systems (hospital systems and
public systems) related to the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce stress and fatigue, - psychological assistance to reduce stress, - changes in working hours, depending on the type of work, to reduce fatigue and avoid infection.

Background: Traumatic spinal cord injuries (TSCIs) are worldwide public health problems that are difficult to cure and impose a substantial economic burden on society. There has been a lack of extensive multicenter review of TSCI epidemiology in northwest China during the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Method: A multicenter retrospective study of 14 selected hospitals in two provinces in northwest China was conducted on patients admitted for TSCI between 2017 and 2020. Variables assessed included patient demographics, etiology, segmental distribution, treatment, waiting time for treatment, and outcomes. Results: The number of patients with TSCI showed an increasing trend from 2017 to 2019, while there were 12.8% fewer patients in 2020 than in 2019. The male-to-female ratio was 3.67:1, and the mean age was 48 ± 14.9 years. The primary cause of TSCI was high falls (38.8%), slip falls/low falls (27.7%), traffic accidents (23.9%), sports (2.6%), and other factors (7.0%). The segmental distribution showed a bimodal pattern, peak segments were C6 and L1 vertebra, L1 (14.7%), T12 (8.2%), and C6 (8.2%) were the most frequently injured segments. In terms of severity, incomplete injury (72.8%) occurred more often than complete injury (27.2%). The American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale of most patients did not convert before and after treatment in the operational group (71.6%) or the conservative group (80.6%). A total of 975 patients (37.2%) from urban and 1,646 patients (62.8%) from rural areas were included; almost all urban residents could rush to get treatment after being injured immediately (<1 h), whereas most rural patients get the treatment needed 4-7 h after injury. The rough annual incidence from 2017 to 2020 is 112.4, 143.4, 152.2, and 132.6 per million people, calculated by the coverage rate of the population of the sampling hospital.

Conclusion: The incidence of TSCI in northwest China is high and on the rise. However, due to pandemic policy reasons, the incidence of urban residents decreased in 2020. The promotion of online work may be an effective primary prevention measure for traumatic diseases. Also, because of the further distance from the good conditional hospital, rural patients need to spend more time there, and the timely treatment of patients from remote areas should be paid attention to.

Introduction
Traumatic spinal cord injuries (TSCIs) can cause significant morbidity and mortality (1). These injuries are often caused by heavy injuries, traffic accidents, falling accidents, etc. and are centered in the labor age population and elderly population (2, 3). Despite the economic differences between countries or regions, this traumatic disease has caused a large loss of the working population, imposing a serious economic burden on patients and families, which leads to high health expenditure and economic losses (4, 5). Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for patients with TSCI--severe damage to the spinal cord usually means permanent impairment (4, 6, 7). Therefore, attention should be paid to primary prevention. Understanding injury risk factors, incidence, and demographic characteristics can better guide the promotion of preventive measures and the allocation of medical resources (8, 9).
The global incidence of TSCI was 10.5 cases per 100,000 persons, but the incidence of TSCI varies across countries and regions (1). China is a country with rapid industrial development and frequent traffic flow; this brings more injury-causing factors, and the spinal trauma caused by it increases yearly (10). Therefore, it is necessary to update Chinese TSCI incidence data in real time. However, most existing studies have focused on East China, while there has been a lack of extensive multicenter review of TSCI epidemiology in northwest China in recent years (6, 11-14). The level of economic development in northwest China is far behind that in East and mid-China regions, and their characteristics of injury factors should be different, so its epidemiological data cannot fully refer to the data in the East and mid-China regions.
In this study, we aimed to discuss the epidemiological characteristics and risk factors of TSCI in northwest China. Thus, we used the multicenter retrospective data from 2017 to 2020 to expand the coverage area of previous studies and discuss the impact of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on society (15).
Materials and methods
Location and participants
Northwest China comprises five provinces or autonomous regions: Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, with a

total population of 102.8 million. We chose Shaanxi and Qinghai, two provinces with representative development levels, as shown in Figure 1A. Shaanxi (SN) Province is a traditional industrial and agricultural region with a population of 38.8 million; Qinghai (QH) Province is an animal husbandry region rich in mineral resources, located in the northern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with a population of 6.1 million. In order to better distribute the research work, Shaanxi is further divided into northern (SN-N), central (SN-C), and southern parts (SNS) according to climate and physiognomy. We dispatched investigators to the four regions separately and selected three to four hospitals with different administrative levels (provincial, municipal, and county) in each region, a total of 14 hospitals, as shown in Figure 1B. The patients' information was gathered from the medical records of these 14 hospitals between January 2017 and December 2020.
Study settings
Eligible patients were screened by the International Classification of Diseases, Version 10 (ICD-10) and its diagnostic code of TSCI. The final diagnosis was based on the patient's diagnosis at discharge/death. Four researchers retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 2,621 patients with TSCI admitted to the 14 hospitals in these two representative provinces between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2020. The acquired information from patients' medical records included the patients' age, gender, occupation, marital status, time of injury, cause of injury, level of injury, severity of the injury, acceptance of surgical treatment, operative mode/approach, damaged segments, preoperative and postoperative scores, rehabilitation therapy, hospital duration, medical costs, and so on.
Executive organization and ethics statement
This project was jointly undertaken by the China Center for Disease Control (China CDC) and Honghui Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Honghui Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University. The institutional review boards of the sampled hospitals

General demographic characteristics of patients with TSCI from 2017 to 2020
A total of 2,621 patients with TSCI from 14 hospitals were identified in this study (Figures 1B, 2). As shown in Table 1, out of these patients, 2,060 were male (78.6%) and 561 were female (21.4%), the male-to-female ratio is close to 3.67:1. The patients' ages ranged from 6 to 92 years, with an average age of

48 (±14.9) years and a median age of 49 (interquartile range 38) years. Among them, the average age of men and women is 48.0 ± 14.9 and 49.4 ± 14.9 respectively. According to the age distribution, it was found that young adults aged 21-40 years make up half of the TSCI population (49.9%). Regarding the occupation, farmers and herdsmen from rural or pastoral areas account for more than half of the total patients (58.1%), and the patients from urban areas are mainly workers (11.8%), students (5.5%), and retirees (5.6%). The other occupational groups included government officers (1.0%), technicians (1.1%), enterprise managers (1.1%), serviceman (0.2%), and others consisting of freelancers, unemployed individuals, and selfemployed individuals who together accounted for 6.9% of the total patients. In addition, 8.7% of patients were unwilling to inform their occupational information for other reasons. Apparently, from 2017 to 2019, there were more patients each year than the previous year, while in 2020, there was a decrease of 12.9% compared with the number of patients in 2019 (Figure 2).
Etiology of the patients with TSCI
Analysis of the acquired etiological data showed that high falls were the leading cause of TSCI, indicating 38.8% of total patients (P < 0.05), followed by slip falls and low falls (27.7%), traffic accidents (23.9%), and sports (2.6%). Other factors include falling objects, violent fights, and other collisions, accounting for 7.0%. Table 2 shows the etiological composition ratio of TSCI in different age groups, in which there is no apparent difference in etiological composition ratio between 20, 21-40, and 40-61 years old groups (P > 0.05). However, the proportion of low-energy injury factors (i.e., slip fall or low fall) was higher in patients 61 years than in other age groups (P < 0.01); nearly half (45.9%) of patients with TSCI over 60 years old are injured by this factor. Table 3 describes the etiological composition of patients of genders. High fall (43.6%) is the most common cause of male patients with TSCI, while slip fall/low fall (37.6%) is the most common cause of female patients with TSCI.

Injury level
As can be seen from the statistics in Figure 3, TSCI occurred at the cervical, thoracic, lumbosacral levels, and the proportions in these levels were 33.0%, 36.8%, and 30.2%, respectively. We counted the number of cases per injury vertebral segment, and there were 79.0 patients with singlelevel spinal fractures and 20.1% patients with multilevel (2 levels) spinal fractures. Figure 3 shows that the distribution of segmental injury cases showed a "bimodal" pattern; analysis of these data indicates that the two peak injury levels of TSCI were C6 and L1 vertebra. Overall, L1, T12, and C6 were the most frequently injured segments, accounting for 14.7%, 12.2%, and 8.2% of the total cases, respectively. Further, the injury types of each vertebral segment are divided into fracture dislocation, distractive flexion fracture (chance fracture), burst fracture, and compression fracture. Roughly analyzing, the most fracture type of TSCI patients due to cervical injury is fracture dislocation, which accounts for 59.1% of cervical injuries. Compression fractures are more common in TSCI patients due to thoracic injury (exclude T12), which accounts for 48.3% of thoracic injuries; the major fracture type of TSCI patients due to lumbosacral injury (include T12) is burst fracture, which accounts for 55.9% of thoracic injuries.
Severity of TSCI
The severity of patients with TSCI was divided into complete quadriplegia (CQ), incomplete quadriplegia (IQ), complete paraplegia (CP), and incomplete paraplegia (IP) according to the degree of injury, as shown in Figure 4A. Most patients with TSCI present with IQ, accounting for 39.5%. The next is IP, accounting for 33.3%. Patients who suffered from complete injury included CQ and CP, accounting for 21.1% and 6.1%, respectively. Admission assessment results using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale system are shown in Figure 4B. From the pie chart of patients with TSCI patients, 26.8% of patients suffered from complete motor and sensory dysfunction (ASIA A), 11.2% suffered from complete motor dysfunction with some part of the sensory function retained (ASIA B), 24.2% had inefficient motor functions (myodynamia of most key muscles <3, ASIA C), and 37.7% had useful motor functions remain (myodynamia of key muscles >3, ASIA D).
The period between injury and admission
We recorded the patient's waiting time from injury to admission. According to the data characteristics, we counted

the 975 patients from urban and 1,646 patients from rural areas with TSCI separately in Figure 5. It was observed that most urban residents (88% of 1,646 patients) were able to rush to hospital for medical treatment within 1 h of injury. When most patients (55.4% of 1,646) with TSCI from rural areas arrived at regional hospitals which are qualified for treatment, 4-7 h had passed since the time of injury.

The annual count of TSCI patients form urban and rural
We divided the annual patient count into two groups: those from urban and those from rural areas. From 2017 to 2020, the annual

number of urban patients was 185, 288, 323, and 172, which showed an increasing trend in the first three years, and decreased apparently in 2020 compared with 2019. From 2017 to 2020, the number of rural patients was 361, 406, 415, and 471, and the number of cases had been rising for four consecutive years.

Treatment of TSCI and status on discharge
In terms of the treatment that TSCI patients received, 2,002 cases received operative treatment and 619 cases received conservative treatment. We regard the outcomes of the patients treated with operative or conservative treatment as a whole. We can figure out the change in patients' condition after receiving one of the treatments from the data in Table 4. Regardless of the treatment, about three-quarters of patients had no change in their ASIA impairment scales before and after treatment; among them, the patients who received surgical treatment accounted for 71.6% and the patients who received conservative treatment accounted for 80%. If the ASIA scale was improved on admission but still at an incomplete level (B/C/D), it would be regarded as improvement, with an improvement rate of 22.4% for those treated surgically 11.6% for those treated conservatively, about half of the former. Patients with the ASIA scale of Grade E at discharge were considered cured; the curing rate of both

methods was unsatisfactory, being 4.8% for operative treatment and 7.1% for conservative treatment. In addition, there were a few cases of deterioration or death.
Estimation of TSCI incidence in northwest China
We can only infer the whole from the approximate relationship between the number of beds in our sampling hospital and the regional population covered by them. By referring to the China Statistical Yearbook (https://www. yearbookchina.com/) from 2017 to 2020, we combined the bed data of the five provinces in northwest China and concluded that the average annual bed number in northwest China during the 4 years was 6.194 beds per thousand people. The total number of beds in the 14 sampled hospitals was about 30,000, so it is estimated that the hospitals could cover a population of 30,000/6.194 × 10-3 = 4,843,397. The 4-year incidence rate of TSCI can be estimated as the ratio of TSCI

Frontiers in Surgery

Wang et al.

10.3389/fsurg.2022.994536

patients admitted in the hospital to the total population covered by the hospital. These hospitals treated 2,621 patients with TSCI in the 4 years from 2017 to 2020. If we use these samples to estimate the population, the 4-year incidence rate of TSCI (per million people) was calculated to be 541.15 cases in the population covered by these hospitals. According to the survey data (Figure 2), the annual incidence rates from 2017 to 2020 were 112.4, 143.4, 152.2, and 132.6 per million people, respectively.
Discussion
Northwest China is an economically backward region in China with low coverage of health insurance and educational level, but it is still developing rapidly. Compared to eastern areas of China, such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangdong, northwest China has several unique characteristics. For example, the proportion of TSCI patients over 60 years in northwest China (24.9%) was higher than that in eastern regions. In addition, the proportion of farmers/nomads (58.1%) in the patients was apparently higher than that in the east (11, 16, 17). Many people are engaged in traditional manual labor or industrial production. Traffic factors and falls are both important injury factors for TSCI in the labor force (industry, agriculture, and husbandry). In the past, we have conducted single-center studies (15). However, despite its underdevelopment with low population density, the total area of five provinces in northwest China is nearly 3.08 million square kilometers, which is a vast area that covers about onethird of the land area of China. To get timely treatment, local patients usually choose a nearby medical center. Therefore, multicenter studies in multiple regions can better represent the whole region than single-center research. We collected the data of patients with TSCI admitted to 14 hospitals located in QH, SN-N, SN-C, and SN-S to understand the changes in the incidence of spinal cord injury patients before and after the emergence of COVID-19 (2017-2020). It can help optimize the allocation of medical resources and provide timely healthcare to the population of more areas.
Annual count results demonstrated an increasing trend in TSCI patients from 2017 to 2019. This trend is consistent with previous research findings (6, 15, 18). Unusually, the patient count in 2020 was apparently lower than that in the previous year; there were 12.8% fewer patients in 2020 than in 2019. We speculate that this is due to the shutdown and some "work-athome" proposals implemented by the Chinese Government in the first two quarters of 2020 to prevent the COVID-19 epidemic. Recent studies on other traumatic diseases have reached similar conclusions (19-21). In addition, from the perspective of patients from urban or rural areas, the impact of these policies on the urban population is far greater than that on the rural population; the number of patients in the urban

population in 2020 is only 53.3% of the last year, while the number of patients in rural areas in 2020 is still increasing compared with that in the previous year. We consider that this is related to the feasibility of shutdown policies and "work-athome" proposals. In cities, where there are more office workers and students, it is easier to work or study online, which largely shields them from exposure to many outdoor injury factors, while agricultural or livestock production is hard to move online. Another indication is that the proportion of patients aged over 60 years in 2020 shows an increase. Due to degenerative bone changes and hypofunction of sensory and motor, nontraffic and low-energy injury factors are more likely to cause TSCI in elderly people than young and middle-aged people (22, 23). Combined with the epidemic policy mentioned earlier, this evidence is consistent with our conclusions. Although the COVID-19 pandemic brings immeasurable economic losses and damages to human health, it also facilitates the development of online work and learning, which makes it possible for many jobs to be performed online from home for a long time. In our conclusion, promoting online office work and learning will make a lot of sense to reduce the incidence of traumatic diseases among people at labor age, especially for urban residents.
In our investigation, the male-to-female ratio in patients with TSCI was 3.67:1, which is similar to the rate reported in other regions (6, 14, 24). This indicates that most of the patients with TSCI are male. This can be attributed to the fact that most workers in dangerous, physically demanding jobs are male and a greater proportion of drivers are male.
Most of the injuries were in the 21-40 age group (49.9%, 1,309 cases), followed by the 61 age group (24.9%, 652 cases) and 41-60 age group (20.9%, 547 cases). There are two age groups with high incidence. Such a "bimodal" trend seems to be different from the conclusions of previous studies. Most of the previous literature works described a "unimodal" trend with the highest age group around 40 ± 10 years old (6, 17, 25). This may be due to the difference in group spacing and the increased incidence of the elderly under the 2020 epidemic policy. The mean age of patients in our data was 48 (±14.9) years, which was higher than the domestic average age and global average age suggested by previous literature works (10, 26). We estimate that this result may be influenced by the aging of society and the policy of delaying retirement time.
Our study also revealed the etiology of the patients with TSCI in northwest China, including, traffic (23.9%), sports (2.6%), low falls (27.7%), high falls (38.8%), and other factors (7.0%). Groups were observed according to age first; we found that high-energy injury factors, such as high falls, were the most common cause of TSCI in 21-40 and 41-60 age groups, accounting for 45.2% and 37.1%, respectively, and in people over 60 years, low-energy factors, such as low falls or slips, accounted for 45.9% of the total cases. This is consistent with the conclusion of the study in Guangdong Province (6). Then, groups were observed according to gender, and the result

indicated that males were more likely to have been impacted by high-energy factors causing TSCI.
Integrating the above etiological results, the age of high incidence of TSCI is still dominated by the labor age, especially in males. So, the labor security agencies of governments and the employers of workers should also strengthen labor safety measures and enhance safety education for employees (13). In addition, specialization and mechanization of agricultural and animal husbandry workers should be promoted so that dangerous and strenuous manual labor can be as far as possible from machines.
Spinal cord injury is usually associated with spinal trauma injury, and the levels of injury are corresponding. We counted the segments of the patient's vertebra and the types of fractures; it is the same as the previous literature; the proportions of injuries in cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae were similar, and the high incidence of spinal fractures caused by TSCI in each part was C5-C6, T11-T12, and L1-L2. The distribution of injury segments showed a "bimodal" distribution with C6 and L1 as the centers, with 1-2 adjacent segments (25, 27). Overall, the T11-L3 segment had the highest proportion of injuries, totaling 1,397 cases, accounting for 42.6% of all injured patients. The main fractural types of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae are also different, which is related to their anatomical structures and mechanical characteristics.
From the severity of the injury and the outcome of treatment, our results revealed a less optimistic condition after treatment. As a result of consensus, incomplete injury (72.8%) occurred more often than complete injury (27.2%). Given the large number of patients with incomplete TSCI, this issue should be the focus of basic research related to neural regeneration, such as "how to promote the compensation of surviving neurons in the injured area" or "how to achieve differentiation of uninjured stem cells into neurons in the incomplete injured segment" (28). The ASIA impairment scale of most patients did not change before and after treatment in both the operational group (71.6%) and the conservative group (80.6%). This illustrates the importance of prevention in improving tertiary prevention measures and rehabilitation techniques as an essential guarantee of improved treatment outcomes. Moreover, the patients who were treated operationally had a higher improvement rate (22.4%) and deterioration rate (0.5%) than the patients who were treated conservatively (improvement rate was 11.6%, deterioration rate was 0.0%). Therefore, improving surgical methods to reduce postoperative complications is also a strategy to improve the efficacy of TSCI.
Our study also focused on urban-rural differences that had not previously been noticed by investigators. The annual difference in the number of cases was mentioned earlier, and we also compared the length of time between the onset and the treatment of patients in urban and rural areas. From our results, we can see that almost all urban residents can rush to the hospital for emergency

treatment after getting injured immediately (<1 h), whereas by the time most patients from rural areas arrive at the hospital for treatment, it has been 4-7 h since they were injured. This reflects the delay in treating patients caused by poor transport conditions in rural areas. In fact, some hospitals in developed areas are already using helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) to save treatment time for patients in remote areas (29). This kind of traffic measure is not restricted by the topography and is of great value for patients with various acute diseases in rural areas such as the Loess Plateau and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in northwest China. The problem is the high cost of HEMS, which also requires better allocation of resources and funding by the public health system.
Finally, we estimated the incidence of TSCI in northwest China based on the hospital coverage population from 2017 to 2020; the incidence rate ranged from 112.2 to 152.4 cases per million people, which is more than 23.7 per million people in Tianjin and 60.6 per million people in Beijing (16, 30). The incidence of TSCI is difficult to calculate due to the unpredictability of the occurrence of trauma. Sampling methods, inclusion criteria, regional demographic differences, and other factors will affect the results. Our estimated results only provide a reference for the incidence of TSCI in northwest China, and more scientific design and observational studies are needed to obtain its incidence accurately.
However, as a retrospective study, there are irreparable misrecords or incomplete information in the data we obtained, which may lead to a deviation between our results and the actual situation. Furthermore, we ignore the data on treatment cost and Medicare coverage, which can well reflect the economic pressure of patients and the development level of the region. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence in some descriptions of the severity of TSCI in northwest China.
Conclusions
In general, the incidence of TSCI in northwest China is high and on the rise. Due to the implementation of COVID-19 prevention and control measures, the incidence of TSCI among urban residents has decreased to a certain extent. Therefore, we suggest that promoting online office and learning is the effective primary prevention measure for traumatic diseases. In addition, due to the differences between urban and rural areas, rural patients need to spend more time getting to a good conditional hospital for treatment, and the problem of emergency transfer service still needs to be addressed.

In December 2019, a new emerging virus causing mild-to-severe pneumonia was detected in China. The virus was described as a variant of SARS-CoV and was called SARS-CoV-2, then declared a pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020. Millions of people contracted the virus and presented with a symptomatology of variable severity, including upper respiratory tract symptoms, systemic symptoms and diarrhea. We herein report a rare skin presentation in a 33-year-old female that occurred both during COVID-19 infection and after receiving the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

Background In December 2019, in the city of Wuhan, severe respiratory infections had been reported and seemed to develop into an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Identified in January 2020 and labeled as a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020, the virus became a global health issue and caused a worldwide sanitary crisis [1]. COVID19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus binding to type 2 alveolar cells in the lung with ACE 2 receptor by a surface spike protein. It can also interact with different cells in the GI tract, kidney, heart and endothelium causing multiorgan failure [2]. The ability of the virus to bind to different cells explains the broad range of symptoms that it can cause. Skin lesions have been reported as a possible symptom of COVID-19. The skin lesions related to this virus consist of five patterns: livedo or necrosis, maculopapular eruptions, urticarial lesions, vesicular eruptions and pseudo-chilblain lesions [3]. Here, we describe the case of a patient with an uncommon pattern of maculopapular eruption during SARS-CoV-2 infection and after receiving COVID-19 vaccine.

Case report
We present the case of a 33-year-old female patient, working as a nurse in the medicine department. She was admitted to the emergency unit on 15 November 2020 for oppressive chest pain, fever, cough, tachycardia and fatigue. A PCR test was positive on 10 November with a cycle threshold (CT) of 18. The severe symptomatology started 24 h before presenting to the emergency department. She also noted having some chills and generalized fatigue within the previous 72 h. The patient was conscious and oriented in space, time and toward people. Blood pressure on admission was 140/80 mmHg, heart rate was 100 beats/min. Patient respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min and SPO2 was 94% on room oxygen. The patient had fever with a body temperature of 38.8C.
The patient does not have any known or documented cardiovascular risk factor: no history of tobacco consumption, dyslipidemia, diabetes or cardiac problems. She is allergic to amoxicillin, with an allergic reaction of a cutaneous rash and angioedema. She also has an intolerance to butylscopolamine, resulting in agitation and irritability. She cannot take metoclopramide as it once resulted in hypotension.

Figure 1. Thoracic computed tomography scan, 15 November 2020.
A blood test performed on 15 November showed slightly increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and d-dimer levels. Full results are shown in Table 1.
A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan performed on 15 November 2020 showed right inferior lobar pneumonia and typical COVID-19 ground glass pattern (Figure 1). No adenomegaly was noted in the mediastinum and no pleural or pericardial effusion was found.
The patient did not require hospitalization due to the absence of comorbidities, a moderate lung inflammation on the scan and stable vital signs without a supplementary need of oxygen. She was released and a medical home treatment was started. It included oral corticosteroid therapy (deflazacort 15 mg per day for 10 days), anticoagulation (fondaparinux 2.5 mg per day for 1 month), prophylactic antiplatelet dose (acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg per day for 2 months), an analgesic and antipyretic (paracetamol 1000 mg per 8 h) and supplements (vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc).
The onset of COVID-19 infection was on 10 November 2020, and involved the skin rather than respiratory system or general state. The skin lesions presented with an uncommon pattern starting with small vesicles on the forearms and the left sub clavicular area on 10 November 2020. On this day, a COVID-19 PCR test was positive with a CT value of 18. This was the first symptom of the infection and other symptoms occurred 24 h later. The skin vesicles evolved into itchy, painful, red, swollen maculopapular lesions (Figures 2 & 3) with progressive regression and complete resolution in one week (Figure 4).

infection despite vaccination (during childhood), and severe H1N1 infection (in 2017). The patient had no history of personal or family auto-immune disease, no chronic or intermittent arthralgia or myalgia.
A complete blood analysis was done on 25 November 2020 and the results are shown in Table 2. CRP and d-dimer levels were normalized. Two PCR tests were done systematically on 24 and 27 November 2020, and were negative. The patient noted an improvement of COVID-19 symptoms. d-dimers were decreasing.
After recovering from COVID-19, the patient noted many episodes of sinus tachycardia treated with betaloc 25 mg ( 12 pill/day). She also had episodes of bronchoconstriction and wheezing treated with symbicort (budesonide/formoterol fumarate) 160 (2 times/day) and ventolin (albuterol) when needed. A COVID-19 serology IgG test was done on 2 February 2021 and showed: IgG = 19.58.
On 25 February 2021, and after 3 months already passed since the infection, the patient received the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for COVID-19. After 12 h of receiving the vaccine, she noted fever, chills, myalgia, vertigo, nausea and emesis. Forty-eight hours later, these symptoms resolved completely.
After 24 h of the first dose, an oral ulceration developed, with multiple maculopapular skin lesions, this time on the dorsal part of the hands. These lesions had the same evolution pattern as the skin lesions that appeared during the onset of the COVID-19 infection, and they disappeared quickly. On 28 February 2021, the patient noted four big maculo-papular lesions on the posterior side of the right forearm, these lesions started as small vesicles (Figure 5) and progressed into red, painful, and itchy maculopapular lesions (Figure 6). She presented at the ED on 2 March 2021, with these lesions, as they became swollen. A central vesicle was visible in each lesion. The pattern of evolution of the forearm lesions, progressing from small vesicles into maculopapular lesions, then regressing before they disappear (Figures 5-8).
On day 5 postvaccination (Figure 7), the patient came to the emergency department, we assessed the clinical status of the patient and ordered biological and microbiological investigations. A PCR test was made along with a serology IgG COVID-19 test to assess the immune status of the patient. A sample was taken from the lesions site for microbiological culture. Intravenous corticosteroid therapy was given (Solu-MEDROL 40 mg/12 h), with empiric antibiotic therapy (clindamycin 100 mg/6 h). The patient was admitted for 72-h surveillance at the hospital, during which she had a palpitation episode with a normal EKG. A hypotension episode was noted. No other

tological or cutaneous manifestations, many studies described and noted the presence of this presentation among patients contracting COVID-19 infection [2,4,5]. An itchy, erythematous rash was described as a COVID-19 symptom in a case report of an Italian nurse, and was the first primary care case report of a female patient who developed a skin rash as the first clinical manifestation of COVID-19 [6].
In our case report, the patient presented an atypical pattern of cutaneous lesions starting with small vesicles at day 1, then turning into maculopapular itchy, painful, red, swollen lesions, then regressing progressively with a complete remission at day 7. These findings were described at two specific times: the first time was simultaneously with COVID-19 infection and the second time, day 3 postvaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, with a negative PCR test for COVID-19.
The pattern of evolution of the lesions is identical, both after the infection and after the vaccine. The IgG value (>100) 5 days postvaccination shows that the patient had developed a strong and quick immune response against the vaccine, which is typical of the secondary immune response and rules out a re-infection. The primary immune response was developed after the patient contracted the virus, and the IgG value was 19 (test performed on 2 February 2021). The patient immune response to the vaccine is typical of a secondary immune response, which is more quick, intense, and durable than the primary immune response, which the patient had against the virus. Thus, a strong activation of the immune response may have caused the skin lesions to appear. Also, the lesions developed after the vaccine in the right forearm were more intense that those developed during the COVID-19 infection. The lesions were found on both forearms and hands, with a unique lesion on the left sub clavicular area.
IgG SARS-CoV-2 were tested, protective levels were found, and the complements levels were normal. However, the history of the patient having allergy to amoxicillin and history of severe viral infections leads us to some hypotheses:
· Correlation between COVID-19 infection and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dermatological reactions · Maculopapular lesions should be added to the large panoply of COVID-19 infection symptomatology · Atypical cutaneous lesions pattern should also be considered as a potential COVID-19 symptom
Due to the increase of vaccinations, there has been an increase in mild allergic reactions that can sometimes lead to serious complications and require attention [7]. Therefore, our patient has been admitted to hospital for 72 h,

Case Report Fata, Jabbour, Kourie, Zoghbi, Kassouf & Zoghbi
to provide appropriate therapy and surveillance. Main possible complications would be an increase in the intensity of the allergic reaction and bacterial infection of the lesions. The most common signs of delayed-type reactions to vaccines are rashes (i.e., various morphologic forms of maculopapular eruptions) [8]. Our patient had a delayed allergic reaction to the vaccine and presented the most common symptom of this allergic reaction, with other associated symptoms preceding the rash (chills, fever, myalgia).
While there is precedent for the biological plausibility that certain subpopulations become susceptible to vaccineinduced reactions after multiple exposures [9], this may correlate with our patient's case where the repetitive exposure to the COVID-19 antigen (the first being after the infection and the second being after the vaccine) triggered an intense postvaccination allergic reaction. This may also predict a strong allergic reaction if the patient were to receive a second vaccine dose.
It was unlikely that the lesions were due to any kind of medication, noting that the cutaneous manifestations appeared simultaneously with the COVID-19 flu-like symptoms. The patient was not receiving any new medications before the vaccine. A concomitant infection is unlikely, especially that postvaccination CRP value was negative. The pattern similarity after COVID-19 infection and vaccine injection is strong reason to rule out iatrogenic or concomitant infectious causes.
Given the importance of detecting COVID-19 in a global pandemic, it is essential to characterize dermatological manifestations and be aware of unusual lesions pattern that may be correlated or due to COVID-19 infection. It is also important to highlight the correlation between COVID-19 cutaneous manifestations and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine manifestations for patients with known dermatological reactions in COVID-19. In this case, we used corticosteroid and clindamycin intravenous therapy to reduce the dermatological reaction and we noted a complete remission in 1 week. Concerning the histopathology of COVID-19 related rashes, biopsy results from case studies performed by both Reymundo et al. and Mazzitelli et al. show perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the skin lesions of all patients [10,11].
Since Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine triggers an immune response against the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus, it may be possible to predict some side effects that may be caused by the immune response against the vaccination, among patients who already contracted the virus prior to vaccination. The maculo-papular lesions that occurred in this case report are a type of symptom, but other specific or nonspecific symptoms caused by the COVID-19 infection among some patients may be caused after the vaccine dose injection.
It has been proven that atopy increases the risk of allergic manifestation after COVID-19 vaccine twofold compared with the population, while no correlation with drug allergy has been elucidated [12]. Knowing that the allergic reaction can be extremely painful and intolerable in some cases, a systemic prevention with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids in the absence of contraindications should be considered in some patients with history of severe allergy.
Further studies should be considered to establish clear recommendations on antihistamine and corticosteroid usage for prevention of allergy among patients scheduled to take COVID-19 vaccine, as well as the importance of this prevention and the patients that benefit the most from it.
Other studies are needed to understand the physiopathology of cutaneous manifestation in COVID-19, and to get a clear idea about the risk factors that might be correlated with such dermatological reactions. The relations between patient's medical history, genetic profile and possible COVID-19 infection manifestations, along with possible allergic and nonallergic side effects of the vaccine, are yet to be elucidated.
Our case study has a limitation: a biopsy of the lesions was not performed, and would have helped further understand immunopathology and histopathology of COVID-19 related rashes and correlate with the histological pattern identified in other studies.
Summary points
· Description of a rare side effect of the COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. · Description of an uncommon pattern of maculopapular lesions in COVID-19. · Identification of a pattern of evolution of the skin lesions that is identical during COVID-19 infection and after

Abstract
Introduction: Currently, the face mask represents an incomparable symbol whose value went from clinical work to impacting the containment of the spread of SARS-CoV-2, although it has become an element of discord in the general population. ­Objective: To establish the impact of face mask use policies on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Methods: Face mask use policy variables, obtained from the website of the #Masks4All scientific movement, were associated with the number of infections, deaths and flattening of the curve published by the Johns Hopkins University resource center and EndCoronavirus.org. Results: Face mask use policies were universal (required in shops, restaurants, public transport), partial (recommended, required in any public place) and absent. Associations of the face mask use policy with total cases (p = 0.01), cases per million (p = 0.04) and deaths per million population (p = 0.02) were statistically significant. Associations of the variables with the epidemiological curve trend were also statistically significant (p = 0.00). Conclusion: The recommendation for face mask widespread use is a measure with sufficient scientific support to reduce the number of COVID-19-related infections and deaths.

Resumen
Introducción: Actualmente, la mascarilla representa un símbolo incomparable cuyo valor pasó del trabajo clínico a impactar en la contención de la propagación del virus SARS-CoV-2; se convirtió en un elemento de discordia en la población general. Objetivo: Establecer el impacto de las políticas de uso de mascarilla en la morbimortalidad por COVID-19. Métodos: Se asociaron las variables de política de uso de cubrebocas, obtenidas de la página web del movimiento científico #Masks4All, con el número de contagios, muertes y aplanamiento de la curva publicados por el centro de recursos de la Universidad Johns Hopkins y EndCoronavirus.org. Resultados: Las políticas de uso de mascarilla fueron de tipo universal (requerido en tiendas, restaurantes, transporte público), parcial (recomendado, requerido en cualquier lugar público) y ausente. Las asociaciones de la política de uso de mascarilla con casos totales (p = 0.01), casos por millón (p = 0.04) y muertes por millón de habitantes (p = 0.02) resultaron estadísticamente significativas. Las asociaciones de las variables con la tendencia de la curva epidemiológica también resultaron estadísticamente significativas (p = 0.00). Conclusión: La recomendación del uso generalizado de mascarilla es una medida con suficiente respaldo científico para reducir el número de contagios y muertes por COVID-19.

Introduction
Stanley Ipkiss ("The Mask"): "It's a power tie... It is supposed to make you feel powerful". This cinematographic dialogue perfectly suits the prominence of face masks during current pandemic, which have become a synonym of authority, a valuable possession.1 The psychological symbolism of the mask is explained by the use of facial expressions to construct ideas about feelings and desires, and thus, the distortion caused by the mask favors an individual response that works in two forms: one that is controlled and another that is implicit.2
The use of face mask in the clinical field dates back to 1700, with the miasmatic theory, which popularized the famous "plague doctor" or beak-shaped masks, described by Charles de Lorme.1 In one chapter of his operating theory, Martin Kirschner (18791942) referred to face masks as "measures to fight infections". In the 1920s, face masks were used for the first time in the surgical field in Germany and the United States.3
The use of protective equipment against respiratory infections within the clinical setting has no questioning regarding its usefulness.4,5 This has allowed this measure to be transferred to the general population, with a beneficial impact,5 which is why even face masks manufactured with rudimentary materials are considered a better alternative to an absence of protection.5,6 The most common face masks in the general population are made with surgical material with less filtration, as well as with daily use garments fabric,7,8 with filtration variations ranging from 9 to 98 %,7 which decreases with reuse and washing cycles.8
At the beginning of current pandemic, the general recommendation regarding the use of face masks was to ration them for use in the medical field, since it was considered that the evidence did not provide conclusive information for indicating widespread use;9 however, concerns of the scientific community generated a debate that led to the dissemination of multiple publications that supported its usefulness.10,11 After weighing the scientific data, the World Health Organization updated the standard for widespread use.12 A systematic review and meta-analysis published by The Lancet in June 2020 was the final endorsement in favor of the indication.13 Despite the above, not all countries considered making this measure a mandatory element for their citizens.

The purpose of this study was to compare the impact of SARS-CoV-2 dispersion between countries with different face mask use policies.
Methods
A cross-sectional, descriptive, observational study was designed. The collected information was comprised of the figures of COVID-19 cases and deaths registered at Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center official website (https://coronavirus. jhu.edu/map.html). The type of policy regarding the use of face masks was obtained from the #Mask4All movement official website (https://masks4all.co). A flattening the curve variable was added, with data obtained from the ENDCORONAVIRUS.org movement official website (https://www.endcoronavirus.org/ countries). The date for data collection was August 30, 2020.
Statistical analysis was carried out according to Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test; normal distribution was considered in case of a p-value > 0.05 (for applying Kruskal-Wallis test), non-normal distribution in case of p < 0.05 (for applying the Anova test), with a p-value < 0.05 being established as being statistically significant. For the relationship between the face mask use policy and the flattening of the curve, the chi-square test was applied. The SPSS program was used.
Results
Data from a total of 215 countries were collected; 129 countries had the corresponding information for the bivariate analyses. Face mask use policy categories were the following: universal, U (5.08 %); required in stores, restaurants, public transport, SRT (29.94 %); partial, P (11.30 %); recommended, R (8.47 %); required in any public place, PP (37.85 %) and absent, A (7.34 %). Epidemiological curve classification was indicated as follows: upward trend, UTc (62.41 %); downward trend, DTc (13.53 %); flattened, Fc (24.06 %). Worldwide, the number of total cases and deaths corresponded to 25,376,529 and 850,140, respectively; and total cases and deaths per million, to 3,256 and 109.1, respectively.
The countries with the highest number of total cases (Table 1) were the United States (6,172,082, P), Brazil (3,862,311, P), India (3,619,169, U), Russia (990,326, P), Peru (647,166, PP), South Africa (625,056, PP),

Figures 1 to 4 illustrate the differences in the countries according to their policies on the use of face mask.
In the relationship of the mask use policy with the flattening of the curve, no statistically significant association was found (p = 14,718). Quantitative variables distribution had a p-value of 0.00, with Kruskal-Wallis test being therefore applied. Face mask use policy associations with total cases (p = 0.01), cases per million (p = 0.04) and deaths per million population (p = 0.02) were statistically significant, but not with the number of total deaths (p = 0.222) (Table 2). The same variables had a statistically significant association (p = 0.00) with the epidemiological curve trend.
Discussion
Considering the indisputable relationship between the use of face masks and a lower number of contagions, in the analyzed sample we observed that 15.81 % of the countries worldwide did not have any established policy for the use of face mask (recommended or absent), and that among the 10 leading countries with more cases, none had a policy in that regard, although the conviction to adopt the use of face mask has increased over time.14
Of note, a low global percentage of countries have a universal policy (5.08 %), and a geographical majority have intermediate indications (almost 80 %). The case of India stands out, since it appears in all lists of high figures despite the policy of face mask

universal use. However, late implementation of this measure can facilitate an accelerated initial number of contagions. In a scenario of a much higher exposure, given the number of patients with transmission potential, there is a higher viral load at each affected area. A work recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine suggests that if viral load is important for the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection to

be determined, a hypothetical reason for using face masks would be the reduction of the inoculum the user is exposed to and the subsequent clinical impact on the disease.15
The misinformation factor should also be taken into account.16,17 There are countries where, despite having a considerable dissemination of scientifically supported data, a good number of their inhabitants refuse to

wear face masks, either due to conspiracy theories, claims of individual liberties or other particular ideas that are characteristic of psychological responses to crises.18,19 Cases such as the protests that took place in the United States or Germany20,21 are the most notorious examples, although it is a fact that Mexico is also under the influence of this type of phenomena,

with consequences such as violence against healthcare workers.22
On the other hand, social distancing is regarded as the central axis of transmission reduction.13 Complementary measures such as hand washing, eye protection, disinfection of environmental surfaces, self-care in case of suspicious symptoms are part of

the multiple recommendations where there is some level of evidence for their dissemination.13,23
An additional issue is face masks reuse. Application of a universal mandatory policy does not necessarily take into account the resources required for its accomplishment and, even less, the possibility of renewal, in addition to the fact that the measure also has a basic quality requirement.8 The phenomenon of disparity can even be considered for the differences in knowledge, attitude and self-care practices during the pandemic to be understood.24
Let us also consider that the provided statistics illustrate the number of cases that are confirmed through tests that have been standardized for this purpose, and that the estimations that are postulated for underreporting to be corrected could therefore indicate a different pattern;25,26 these numbers depend on the quantity and quality of tests carried out by each country (e.g., the sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction [PCR] is almost 100 %, but its specificity varies from 60 to 89 %27), on the handling itself of the data contained in the registries, and even on the way transmission of the virus regionally behaves.
Despite the above, it is a statistical fact that, in our research, we found a significant relationship between the policy on face mask use and the number of contagions, which supports previous findings.13,23,28 The analysis carried out so far is useful in the absence of a statistically significant link between the face mask use policy and the flattening of the curve phenomenon.
The statistically significant relationship between mortality/case fatality rate (in deaths per million population) and the use of face masks, adds evidence to publications that support this impact.28 Initially, age was considered to be the differential factor in

mortality;29 however, evolution of the pandemic has conferred weight to comorbidities not only in terms of the risk of death, but also regarding the severity of the condition and the probability of admission to a critical care unit.30 Obesity, hypertension and diabetes are the main risk factors,23,31 as well as illnesses that most countries with a high mortality rate are quite familiar with due to their elevated prevalence. Sociodemographic, geographic and environmental characteristics, as well as those diseases that are characteristic of each region, are going to be a determining element for these estimations.23 Although the policy on the use of face masks will not have all the weight in this impact, the fact that reducing the speed of transmission can optimize available resources for patient care cannot be overlooked; that was the lesson learned from the spread of COVID-19 through Asia and Europe.32,33 Finally, it should be borne in mind that, so far, there is no specific treatment for this disease, a fact that makes it essential for a model focused on prevention to be proposed.34
Conclusions
The recommendation for the widespread use of face mask is a measure with sufficient scientific support for reducing the number and speed of SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission and mortality, which is why it is necessary for it to be considered when establishing containment measures for critical episodes similar to that of current pandemic. The value of a generalized policy is considerably high in the scenario of new outbreaks, with the need for citizen education. There are multiple additional variables that must be considered, which are more complex when the mortality/case fatality rate aspect is examined.

Abstract: To estimate specific proximal and distal effects of COVID-19-related restrictions on families on children's adjustment problems, we conducted a six-site international study. In total, 2516 parents from Australia, China, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America living with a young child (Mage = 5.77, SD = 1.10, range = 3 to 8 years, 47.9% female) completed an online survey between April and July 2020. The survey included the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and family risk factors (parent distress, parent-child conflict, couple conflict, and household chaos) as well as a scale to index COVID-19-related family disruption. Our analyses also included public data on the stringency of national restrictions. Across the six sites, parental responses indicated elevated levels of hyperactivity, conduct, and emotion problems in children from families characterized by heightened levels of parent distress, parent-child conflict, and household chaos. In contrast, increased peer problems were more strongly related to COVID-19-related social disruption and stringency measures. Mediation models demonstrated that associations between COVID-19 social disruption and child difficulties could be explained by parental distress. Taken together, these results suggest that although the experience of the pandemic differed across countries, associations between COVID-19-related family experiences and child adjustment difficulties were similar in their nature and magnitude across six different contexts. Programs to support family resilience could help buffer the impact of the pandemic for two generations.

1. Introduction
While the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically restricted everyone's lives, its impact on young children may be especially important for at least four reasons. First, according to developmental systems theory [1], children's trajectories and developmental outcomes are the result of dynamic interactions between individual (e.g., genetic, neural, biological, and cognitive), family, and contextual factors. Crucially, children's outcomes show heightened susceptibility to the influence of family processes, especially during sensitive periods of development. One such period is the preschool to early school-age years, when children make the important transition to school and begin to develop friendships [2]. Second, compared with older school-aged children and adolescents, young children spend much of their time near parents and so may be indirectly affected by the impact of the pandemic via parental wellbeing and availability (e.g., [3]). Third, young children lack the experience and skills needed to maintain social relationships via virtual platforms, so their social interactions depend upon face-to-face contact and outdoor play [4]. Fourth, difficulties in

understanding health risks may amplify the stress associated with changes and restrictions, for example, "stay-at-home" rules and mass school closures.
1.1. Cascading Effects of COVID-19 Experiences on Child Adjustment
During times of stress and crisis, children are likely to require closer contact with caregivers [1,5]. Evidence to support this view comes from reports of increased child clinginess, distractibility, and irritability during the pandemic [6,7]. Compounding these child demands, the pandemic has also generated widespread financial strain, family conflict, and concern for loved ones [8], while mass school closures have obliged many working parents to deliver home-schooling, further escalating parent stress [9]. Parental distress in response to these multiple stressors may have cascading effects on child mental health [10], as illustrated by worrying evidence of a significant increase in child abuse during the pandemic [11]. In presenting this conceptual framework, Prime and colleagues [10] draw on evidence illustrating both direct and indirect adverse effects of natural disasters/economic crashes on parent wellbeing, with negative consequences for children.
To date, research on the impact of the pandemic on young children has typically relied on data from single-site samples, raising questions regarding the generalizability of the study findings. This is significant as developmental systems theory (e.g., [12]) emphasizes the importance of interactions between familial and societal factors (i.e., micro and macro levels of influence) that vary across time and place. Contrasts in both levels of virus transmission and political motivations have led to significant between-country variation in responses to the COVID-19 pandemic (c.f. [13]) such that families have had markedly different pandemic experiences. This between-country variation accentuates within-country socioeconomic and racial inequalities. Focusing on between-country differences, the current study adopted an international design combining data from six different countries to estimate specific effects of COVID-19-related experiences on child adjustment difficulties. Informed by Prime's theoretical framework [10], we also sought to test whether the effect of COVID-19 disruption on child adjustment difficulties was mediated by parental distress. To this end, given the hypothesized importance of parental wellbeing, a preliminary goal of the current study was to test whether our measure of parent distress was invariant across site.
1.2. Cross-Cultural Differences in Child Adjustment during the Pandemic
A survey of almost 18,000 caregivers in 46 countries showed that markers of child distress (e.g., sleep disturbances and aggression) were positively related to the length of school closures [14]. Whilst this suggests a pervasive adverse effect of COVID-19 restrictions on children's psychosocial adjustment, meaningful cross-cultural research hinges upon establishing the equivalence of measures. This entails testing whether instruments assessing child adjustment difficulties show "measurement invariance" across groups [15]. Adopting this approach, the current international consortium brought together researchers with a common interest in family influences on children's adjustment across six countries with diverse COVID-19 experiences: Australia, China, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.
In Spring 2020, these six countries were at different points of virus transmission. Notably, infections in China preceded cases in the other sites. These six sites also adopted distinct policies to limit the spread of the virus. Indeed, Sweden was widely considered an outlier on the global stage with their relatively liberal level of pandemic restrictions and, crucially for young children and their parents, lack of national school closures. After demonstrating across-site measurement invariance for parental SDQ ratings [16], we showed that during the pandemic, Swedish parents reported the lowest levels of child peer problems and the highest level of child prosocial behaviors, whilst British parents reported the highest levels of child emotional and hyperactivity problems. These descriptive data are important, but research is needed to understand the mechanisms underpinning these adverse effects [17]. The overarching aim of the current study was to test whether similar

or distinct family and COVID-19 experiences are associated with individual differences in children's adjustment difficulties across these six different countries.
1.3. Domain-Specific Influences on Child Adjustment
Given that the COVID-19 pandemic has had multiple impacts on family life, an obvious question is whether different risk factors show distinct patterns of association with child outcomes. As noted above, the developmental systems framework [1] posits three levels of influence on developmental outcomes: individual, family context, and society/culture. Empirical evidence also highlights the domain-specific nature of influences within any one of these levels. For example, in a longitudinal and detailed observational study, Hughes and Devine [18] found that while some family measures (e.g., home learning environment and frequency and complexity of family talk) have a relatively global influence, other measures (e.g., negative control and parental scaffolding) show specific associations with distinct aspects of children's development.
Three pandemic studies indicate that child adjustment problems are associated with poorer parent mental health, household chaos, and family conflict. However, these family risk factors have yet to be considered in tandem or across different contexts. As a result, little is known about either their relative salience and independence or about the generalizability of pathways. Addressing these gaps, the current international study examined the unique impact of parent mental health, household chaos, and family conflict on both child internalizing and externalizing problems in the early stages of the pandemic. Findings from two studies suggest a differentiated pattern of associations between family risk factors and child outcomes in the context of COVID-19. First, consistent with robust evidence for a negative impact of parental depression on children's behavioral and emotional problems [19,20], Romero et al. [21] surveyed parents of 1049 Spanish 3- to 12-year-olds and found that parents' self-reported distress showed moderate links with ratings of child externalizing problems but was unrelated to ratings of children's prosociality. Second, in an American study of 303 parents of 6-year-olds, Waller et al. [22] reported that reduced parental warmth and increased harsh discipline during the pandemic were each associated with elevated levels of callous unemotional traits, but only harsh parenting was associated with elevated levels of conduct problems. These findings are consistent with theoretical accounts attesting to the negative impact of "coercive cycles" of conflictual parent-child interactions (rather than simply the absence of warmth) on children's conduct problems (e.g., [23]). By contrast, less differentiated findings have emerged from a socially diverse American sample of preschoolers [24]. Specifically, increased levels of household chaos and parenting stress appear associated with elevated depressive symptoms and externalizing problems [24]. These domain-general findings are consistent with longitudinal work with 511 families establishing the negative impact of household instability and disorganization on a variety of outcomes across China, Colombia, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines, and Thailand [25].
Within the growing body of family studies of child adjustment in the context of the pandemic, the potential role of couple relationship quality has as yet received very little attention. This is surprising as parallels between economic adversities and the pandemic indicate that both can affect child wellbeing via couples' dyadic processes, such as increasing hostility or withdrawing support [26]. Associations between conflict and child negative outcomes may be direct, for example, via social learning mechanisms, triggering child distress or undermining feelings of security [27], or indirect via impacting the quality of parent-child relationship [28]. Thus, in addition to considering parent-child conflict, our study sought to test whether couple relationship conflict also had a deleterious effect on children's adjustment and, crucially, whether patterns of association between family risk factors and children's psychosocial problems were similar across six different pandemic contexts.

1.4. The Current Study
Our multisite design served two purposes: (i) to test whether the family processes implicated in the impact of the pandemic on children's psychosocial functioning are similar across the six sites and (ii) to disentangle the impact of proximal (i.e., family disruption) versus distal (i.e., stringency of government restrictions) COVID-19-related experiences on children's adjustment difficulties. Alongside these cross-cultural comparisons, our study addressed two further questions. First, do family risk factors and COVID-19-related experiences show specific influences on child adjustment difficulties? Here, we hypothesized independent contributions from each risk factor to child difficulties but anticipated that more proximal COVID-19-related disruption would exert a stronger influence than distal factors (i.e., government stringency). We adopted an exploratory approach when considering whether the magnitude of associations would differ by child outcome. Second, does parental distress mediate the association between COVID-19 social disruption and child adjustment difficulties? Here, we hypothesized that COVID-19-related social disruption would indirectly impact child adjustment difficulties via elevated levels of parental distress.

2. Methods
2.1. Participants and Procedure
Between 1 April and 7 July 2020, we recruited 2516 parents with one or more children aged 3 to 8 years old (Mage = 5.77, SD = 1.10) to participate in an online survey (via Qualtrics) of family wellbeing and child adjustment in the COVID-19 pandemic. To be eligible to participate, parents had to be aged 18 or above, report no major psychiatric problems or learning difficulties, and have one or more child aged 4-6. Parents were asked to choose one child in the relevant age group when completing the survey. Following ethical review in each site (and translation from English), the survey was advertised widely via social media and university/school mailing lists in Australia, China, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States of America (USA).
In total, 6.4% of respondents were in Australia (n = 161), 13.4% were in China (n = 336), 9.7% were in Italy (n = 244), 31.6% were in Sweden (n = 795), 28.1% were in the UK (n = 706), and 10.9% were in the USA (n = 274). As described in Table 1, respondents were typically female (81.5% female and 8% male, with 10.5% preferring not to say), aged 21 to 65 years old (Mage = 37.34, SD = 5.39 years), and highly educated (63.1% undergraduate or higher degree or equivalent vocational qualification). Only 50% reported their ethnicity, of which 50% identified as white, 29% as Asian, and 21% as having mixed or multiple ethnicities. Between-site contrasts for each of these demographic characteristics were weak (see Table 1); however, these subsamples are not considered to be representative of all parents and children in each site, in particular those from low socioeconomic backgrounds.

2.2. Measures Child Adjustment
Participants completed the parents' version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which is used globally to screen for children's social, emotional, and behavioral problems [29]. The SDQ consists of 25 statements, each rated on a three-point scale (not true, somewhat true, and certainly true), with five items yielding a prosociality subscale and 20 items relating to child difficulties, namely hyperactivity and emotional, peer, and conduct problems [29,30]. Multiple group confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that a 5-factor solution was the best fitting model and showed across-site scalar invariance [16]. For the purposes of this study, we focused on the four child difficulties subscales.
2.3. COVID-19 Experience
Social Disruption. A 5-item composite was created to index whether the COVID-19 pandemic had led to respondents experiencing disruption. The first item asked if the parent had experienced a change in employment (i.e., unemployment) because of the COVID-19 pandemic (0 = no, 1 = yes). The second item asked if the parent had experienced a drop in income due to the COVID-19 pandemic (0 = no, 1 = yes). The last three items asked respondents how much they had experienced financial strain, work/family conflict, and worry about loved ones as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with these three items rated on a 4-point scale: "not at all", "very little", "moderate", and "very much". To index any level of disruption, scores were dichotomized so that respondents who indicated "not at all" received a 0 and those who responded "very little", "moderate", or "very much" received a 1. Total scores for social disruption ranged from 0 to 5; higher scores denoted greater disruption.
Stringency. We extracted data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), which collects twice-weekly data on governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic across countries. The composite stringency index combines nine indicators, including government containment and closure policies (e.g., school and workplace closure) and public health campaign messaging (e.g., targeted versus general public health information) [13]. For each of the nine indicators, individual ordinal values are given for the last week, with a half-point subtracted if the score is general rather than targeted. The scores are then rescaled by their maximum value to create a score ranging from 0 to 100. We created individual measures of the macro level constraint experienced by a family by matching the OxCGRT data with the date the respondent completed the questionnaire.
2.4. Family Risk Factors
Parental Distress. To index parents' current mental health, we included the widely used General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) [31], which has been translated into more than 38 languages such that each site could adopt a previously validated translation. On a 4-point scale, respondents were asked whether they experienced/have experienced a particular symptom or behavior over the past two weeks. The bimodal (0-0-1-1) was used for scoring system (0 = less than usual, 0 = no more than usual, 1 = rather more than usual, and 1 = much more than usual). A total sum score was created, with higher scores indicating greater distress ( = 0.89).
Parent-Child Conflict. Using one item on a 5-point scale developed for the purpose of this study, respondents indicated whether they had experienced an increase in conflict with the target child (1 = marked increase, 2 = small increase, 3 = no change, 4 = small decrease, and 5 = marked decrease). Scores were revered so that a high score reflected more conflict.
Couple Conflict. Parents' current relationship quality was measured with 10 items developed for the purpose of this study. Using a 5-point scale (1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = in half of our interactions, 4 = often, and 5 = nearly always), respondents indicated the frequency of behaviors that signal relationship problems (e.g., criticism, controlling, and verbal/physical abuse). A mean score was created, with a higher score denoting more conflict between parents ( = 0.95).

Household Chaos. Each of the 15 items in the Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS) [32] had a 4-point scale enabling respondents to indicate how strongly they agreed with statements about the current level of noise, crowding, and routines in their home (1 = very much like our home, 2 = often like our home, 3 = a bit like our home, and 4 = not at all like our home). A mean score was created, with higher scores indicating a more chaotic household ( = 0.75).
Demographics. Parents also provided information on their child's age and gender as well as indicators of their socioeconomic status (SES). A SES composite was developed comprising measures of the parent(s) education, occupation, and housing. Specifically, using a scale relevant to their own country, respondents reported on their own educational attainment and, if applicable, the educational attainment of the target child's other primary caregiver. These scores were then recoded to reflect the closest equivalent in the British system (i.e., high school/secondary, post-secondary, undergraduate, or higher degree). Next, respondents reported on their own occupation, which was coded according to the UK Standard Occupation Classification system [33]. Occupations were coded as low-level (e.g., sales and factory work), mid-level (e.g., skilled-trade and services) and high-level (e.g., managers and professionals). Finally, respondents were asked to report on their household, specifically the number of bedrooms in their home and whether their home was "small and cramped", "small but adequate", "quite spacious", or "very spacious". A z-score was created for each item. The final aggregate reflected a mean of z-scores from four to six items, whereby a high score reflected higher SES ( = 0.67).

2.5. Analysis Plan
Analyses were conducted using Mplus Version 8 [34]. Prior to examining the main research questions, we examined the latent factor structure of ratings of parent distress (GHQ). We evaluated model fit using three primary criteria: comparative fit index (CFI) > 0.90, Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) > 0.90, and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) < 0.08 [35]. To test measurement invariance across site, we used multigroup CFA, which involves systematically adding equality constraints to the model and testing the change in model fit of these nested models [36]. Nested model comparisons were judged to be invariant if the CFI decreased by 0.020 and RMSEA increased by 0.003 [37]. From this basis, we then conducted between-site comparisons of our independent variables of interest and examined correlations between the main measures (Table 2).

Next, we adopted a path modeling approach to examine the associations between COVID-19-related experiences, family processes, and child adjustment [34]. We used a maximum likelihood estimator with robust standard errors (MLR) and evaluated model fit using Brown's [35] recommended criteria. Model parameters and standard errors were estimated in Mplus using all available data [38]. To assess whether path estimates were similar across countries, a multiple group model was fitted [35]. Brown [33] notes multiplegroup solutions can be evaluated when the group sizes vary. To this end, we fitted a

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11136

7 of 14

model in which all paths were freely estimated across site and subsequently compared this model to a model in which all paths were constrained to be equal across site. We assessed differences in model fit using the Satorra-Bentler 2 difference test [39]. Finally, we tested whether parent distress mediated the association between COVID-19 disruption and child adjustment problems using Mplus' bootstrapping procedures (5000 bootstrap samples).
3. Results 3.1. Preliminary Analyses: Between-Site Differences in Parents' COVID-19 Experience and Distress
As illustrated in Figure 1, there were between-site contrasts in national government stringency scores (F(5) = 755.84, p < 0.0001, 2 = 0.60) and in the experience of COVID19-related social disruption (F(5) = 38.34, p < 0.0001, 2 = 0.07). Due to the frequency of planned post-hoc contrasts, we applied a more stringent alpha rate (p < 0.003). In terms of stringency scores, there were significant contrasts between most countries, aside from between China and Sweden. For COVID-19-related social disruption, families in the USA experienced a greater level of disruption compared to families in all sites, aside from the UK, while families in Sweden reported less disruption than all sites, except for Australia. Families in the UK reported more disruption than those in Italy, Australia, and Sweden.
Prior to comparing between-site differences in parental distress, we tested for crosssite measurement invariance of the GHQ using multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis. A partially scalar invariant single-factor model with factor loadings and thresholds free to vary across sites for only one out of 12 items (item 8 "Been able to face up to your problems") showed a good fit to the data (RMSEA = 0.082 [0.076, 0.087], CFI = 0.969, TLI = 0.967). This suggests that across site, the organization of the construct is similar (i.e., configural invariance), with each item contributing in a similar way to the construct (i.e., metric invariance), and the cut-off underling the distribution of scores are consistent (i.e., scalar invariance). Together, this suggests that the GHQ is appropriate for use across different contexts during the pandemic.
Using this partially scalar invariant GHQ model, we then tested for mean differences in the latent factor for parent distress across sites. Parents in the UK reported significantly more distress than parents in Italy, China, and Sweden, whilst American parents also reported higher levels of distress than Italian or Swedish parents.
3.2. COVID-19-Related Experience, Family Risk Factors, and Child Adjustment
We regressed the four child difficulties subscales: conduct problems, hyperactivity, emotion problems, and peer problems onto variables measuring family risk factors (parent distress, parent-child conflict, couple conflict, and household chaos), COVID-19 experiences (disruption and stringency), and demographics (child age, sex, and SES). The model showed good fit (RMSEA = 0.062, 90%CI [0.053, 0.071], CFI = 0.974, TLI = 0.923) and explained a significant proportion of the variance in child hyperactivity (R2 = 0.29), conduct problems (R2 = 0.36), emotion problems (R2 = 0.24), and peer problems (R2 = 0.16).

As illustrated in Table 3, increased levels of parent distress, parent-child conflict, and
household chaos were associated with higher levels of problem behaviors. A Wald chi-
square test of model constraints revealed the association between parent distress and child
problems was similar in magnitude between conduct, hyperactivity, and emotion problems but weakest for peer problems (2 (3) = 54.38, p < 0.0001). There was a stronger association
between parent-child conflict and conduct problems than between parent-child conflict and hyperactivity, emotional, or peer problems (2 (3) = 68.81, p < 0.0001). The association
between household chaos and conduct problems was also stronger than the association between household chaos and emotion or peer problems (2 (3) = 35.63, p < 0.0001). There
was a stronger association between couple conflict and emotion and conduct problems than with hyperactivity (2 (3) = 39.28, p < 0.0001). COVID-19-related disruption and stringency
were both associated with greater child difficulties but more strongly associated with peer problems than with the other three dimensions (2 (3) = 12.91, p < 0.0001; 2 (3) = 23.91,
p < 0.0001). Specifically, we fitted a multiple-group model in which all paths were freely
estimated across site and subsequently compared this model to a model in which all paths
were constrained to be equal across site. Compared to the baseline model, this constrained model indicated no significant differences in the pathways between sites (2 = 16.12,
p > 0.05).

3.3. COVID-19-Related Disruption and Child Adjustment: The Mediating Role of Parental Distress
Following this, using bootstrapping procedures [40], we tested whether parental distress mediated the impact of COVID-19-related social disruption on children's adjustment difficulties. The unstandardized estimate of the indirect effect and 95% confidence intervals with 5000 bootstrap samples was significant for hyperactivity (0.04 [0.03, 0.05], p < 0.001), conduct problems (0.03 [0.02, 0.041], p < 0.001), and emotion problems (0.04 [0.03, 0.05], p < 0.001) but not peer problems (0.01 [0.00, 0.02]).

4. Discussion
Despite significant between-site contrasts in mean levels of parental distress and experiences of COVID-19, two key findings highlighted the similarity of associations between family risk factors, COVID-19 experiences, and children's psychosocial adjustment in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic across the six sites. First, children from families characterized by parental distress, increased levels of parent-child conflict, and chaos showed elevated levels of hyperactivity, conduct, and emotion problems. In contrast, increased peer problems were more strongly related to COVID-19-related experiences (both stringency of national restrictions and family-level social disruption). The magnitude of these associations was strongest for chaos, while couple conflict was not significantly related to child adjustment problems. This differentiated pattern of associations supports domainspecific models of social influences on child development and highlights the potential

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11136

10 of 14

multiplicity of mechanisms implicated in young children's psychosocial adjustment in the context of the pandemic [41]. Second, our analyses revealed indirect associations between COVID-19-related social disruption and child adjustment difficulties that were mediated by parental distress. Below, we discuss possible explanations for these findings considering our sample limitations.
4.1. Family Dysfunction and COVID-19 Experiences Show Direct Links with Child Difficulties
Over and above effects of child age and family SES, increased levels of problems across each of the four problem subscales of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [29,30] were associated with both micro (parent distress, parent-child conflict, couple conflict, and household chaos) and macro (national stringency) levels of influence. This multiplicity of associations is consistent with developmental systems framework's central premise that children's psychosocial development should always be considered in context and that children are particularly responsive to principal relationships within their microsystem [1,12].
While family risk factors were weakly associated with peer problems, they explained around a third of the variance in ratings for hyperactivity, emotion problems, and conduct problems, strengthening the view that coregulation (reflecting parent-child reciprocity, responsiveness, and cooperation) provides a key foundation for behavioral adjustment (e.g., [42]), that is, children's acquisition of useful skills and habits for regulating their emotions and behavior hinges upon parental warmth and structure, which can be constrained by mental health problems and household chaos [43].
Our findings also mirror reports of a protective effect of family routines on children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms during the pandemic in the USA [24]. As economic insecurity, irregular employment, and limited access to childcare all predict household chaos (e.g., [44]), elevated levels of family chaos are likely to persist. Given that initial levels and increases in the quality of the home environment predict gains in school readiness [45], a clear practical implication of our results is the need to support parents in their efforts to provide a stable home environment.
Family risk factors exerted a weaker effect on peer problems, which is unsurprising given mass school closures. Instead, highlighting the impact of depriving children of the stimulation and enrichment associated with interactions with other children, peer problems were more clearly associated with the country-wide severity of containment and family-level disruption. On this latter point, it follows that in experiencing unemployment, financial strain, work-family conflict, and worry about loved ones, parents themselves are (or feel) unable to participate in typical group practices, thus limiting children's opportunities to observe and practice their social skills [46]. Importantly, positive peer relationships are associated with a host of other child outcomes, including the development of children's identity, socio-cognitive skills, and understanding of social norms [47]. As a result, "catch-up" interventions need to extend beyond the academic domain to include emotional support and enriched opportunities for peer play. Notably, these suggestions are possible due to our inclusion of peer problems as a specific outcome of interest, a domain largely absent from earlier research that demonstrated large-scale economic crashes were linked to decline in children's mental health [48].
4.2. COVID-19-Related Disruption, Family Risk Factors, and Child Difficulties: Indirect Effects
The parents who took part in our online survey reported poor mental health during the early stages of the pandemic, with just over half of parents scoring 3 or more on the GHQ, a cut-off with high specificity and sensitivity commonly used to indicate the presence of a clinically relevant symptoms across diverse samples [49]. Our results highlighted the impact of parental distress as a mediator of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child adjustment. This is consistent with a recent American study that showed experiencing the disease in the family as well as the succeeding economic effects both impact family wellbeing [8]. Social learning accounts would suggest the onset and maintenance of child difficulties result from children modeling their parents' behaviors or

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11136

11 of 14

ineffective coping strategies. Alternatively, this indirect effect may be carried by changes in parent-child talk, such as inappropriate health risk communication, or compromised parenting practices, such as reduced sensitivity (e.g., [50]). Interestingly, an American study found parents' worries about COVID-19 were not associated with harsh discipline or reduced warmth [22]. However, this null association may reflect the focus on worrying about contracting and passing on the virus, which may have instead manifested in other behaviors, such as increased handwashing. Future longitudinal research will help tease apart these competing explanations as well as test whether changes in parents' wellbeing across the pandemic contribute to individual differences in the trajectories of children's psychosocial problems. That said, it seems evident that family-based interventions may prove most effective in mitigating the negative impact of the pandemic on child adjustment. Furthermore, the advent of innovative work evaluating the success of online family therapy suggests that these interventions do not have to wait until families can meet their therapist in person [51].
Our findings draw on data collected from families across six study sites with different virus infection rates and government approaches, leading to contrasting social, economic, and cultural effects. Reflecting these contrasts, our findings showed site contrasts in levels of COVID-19-related social disruption and stringency. Specifically, families in the USA and UK experienced more disruption than families in all other sites, and Swedish families experienced the least disruption. Nevertheless, with regard to mechanisms of influence on child adjustment, the findings from the different sites indicate striking similarities. This generality of results strengthens the evidence suggesting the cascading impact of economic pressure on child developmental outcomes via parent wellbeing across a variety of family structures, ethnic backgrounds, and geographic locations [52].
5. Conclusions
Our study drew on an international sample of 2516 parents and applied tests of measurement invariance to both our outcome and mediating variables to provide meaningful cross-cultural comparisons. That said, our findings should be interpreted considering a number of methodological limitations.
First, our convenience sample of parents from middle to high socioeconomic backgrounds impacts the external validity and generalizability of our findings. The subsamples were restricted in terms of geographic (e.g., American parents in Pennsylvania and Ohio and Chinese parents in Beijing) and socioeconomic (e.g., almost 60% of Italian parents in our study had a tertiary education qualification compared to the national average level of 20% [53]) position and were ethnically homogenous. Here, it is worth noting that, unfortunately, a large proportion of parents in China did not report on their ethnicity, which further limits our understanding of the representativeness of the Chinese subsample. Furthermore, the necessary reliance on online research designs during the pandemic increases the likelihood of selection bias and collider bias [54]. For example, participation is likely associated with increased engagement with social media campaigns, scientific interest, and higher education levels [54]. As a result, we cannot rule out that our models replicate across different countries because those who took part were largely similar (i.e., middle to high socioeconomic backgrounds). However, given we found associations between COVID-19 disruption, family risk factors, and child adjustment within a restricted range of SES, it is likely our estimates are conservative. Further research is required with more diverse samples as well as with families living in low or middle income countries to test whether our results replicate beyond this specific demographic.
Second, the cross-sectional design limits our appreciation of the nature of the mediation findings. The findings may not be pandemic specific given we cannot rule out the impact of pre-existing levels of distress on parents' current mental health. That said, our sample did not have a history of psychopathology, and our theoretically informed analyses focused on disruption to life due to COVID-19-specific changes in association with current levels of distress [13]. Future longitudinal research is required to rule out

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 11136

12 of 14

alternative explanations regarding the directionality of our results (i.e., child difficulties eliciting parental stress).
Third, like other colleagues, we relied upon a single informant to report on both parents and children, which may inflate associations between constructs. However, as illustrated in Table 2, we found modest associations between family processes and child outcomes. Our results are strengthened by including an objective assessment of COVID19 experiences. Specifically, a publicly available data set that assessed the stringency of national restrictions enabled us to test the impact of this distal influence on child adjustment. As this measure is strongly positively correlated with national rates of infection [55], it also provides a proxy for national infection rates and a time-specific index of the severity of the disease's impact. As we move towards more open science, future collaborative efforts that pool individual participant data measuring similar constructs will be helpful in developing an understanding of the varied impact of the pandemic on parent and child adjustment across diverse contexts.
With these caveats in mind, the findings from this international study provide further evidence that the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is multigenerational, impacting parents' wellbeing and children's social skills and adjustment difficulties. As a result, family-based interventions may prove most effective in mitigating the negative impact of the pandemic on child adjustment.

Objective: To characterize the evolution of healthcare workers' mental health status over the 1-year period following the initial COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and to examine baseline characteristics associated with resolution or persistence of mental health problems over time.
Methods: We conducted an 8-month follow-up cohort study. Eligible participants were healthcare workers working in Spain. Baseline data were collected during the initial pandemic outbreak. Survey-based self-reported measures included COVID-19-related exposures, sociodemographic characteristics, and three mental health outcomes (psychological distress, depression symptoms, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms). We examined three longitudinal trajectories in mental health outcomes between baseline and follow-up assessments (namely asymptomatic/stable, recovering, and persistently symptomatic/worsening).
Results: We recruited 1,807 participants. Between baseline and follow-up assessments, the proportion of respondents screening positive for psychological distress and probable depression decreased, respectively, from 74% to 56% and from 28% to 21%. Two-thirds remained asymptomatic/stable in terms of depression symptoms and 56% remained symptomatic or worsened over time in terms of psychological distress.
Conclusion: Poor mental health outcomes among healthcare workers persisted over time. Occupational programs and mental health strategies should be put in place.

COVID-19 Impact on Healthcare Workers

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has had substantial mental health impact on healthcare workers (HCWs), largely due to increases in healthcare capacity requirements driving job redeployments and extended working hours in combination with very high risk of contagion and death. Estimates from cross-sectional studies conducted during the initial pandemic outbreak suggest that between 25% and 50% of HCWs may have experienced clinically significant symptoms of anxiety or depression [1-7] and posttraumatic stress [1, 3, 7].
The extent to which the deleterious mental health effects brought about by the initial pandemic outbreak may have subsequently led to negative mid- and long-term mental health outcomes among HCWs, however, remains largely unexplored--despite important public health and clinical implications [8]. For instance, whether mental health support interventions for HCWs should be maintained in the long-term following the initial pandemic outbreak remains unexplored. Initially, it seemed plausible that a large proportion of the burden of mental health symptoms initially reported by HCWs would eventually resolve, either following cessation of exposure to the acute stressor or after adequate targeted interventions (e.g., self-care and low-intensity psychotherapeutic interventions). Nevertheless, because the initial pandemic outbreak has been followed by a series of ongoing subsequent pandemic waves that continue to strain health systems across the globe, there is a generalized concern that a substantial proportion of HCWs may be experiencing persistent mental health problems. According to the World Health Organization, reducing the long-term mental health impact of the pandemic on HCWs is considered a major clinical and public health priority. Estimating the mid- and long-term mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among HCWs is paramount for occupational and mental healthcare planning purposes. In addition, identifying risk and protective factors for persistence of clinically significant mental health burden can help improve implementation of evidence-based detection and treatment strategies. For example, risk and protective factors can guide early identification and targetting of at-risk individuals for more efficient treatment resource allocation. Notwithstanding, evidence examining prevalence and predictors of persistence of mental health symptoms among HCWs from longitudinal cohort studies is scarce [9-12].
Here we used a large sample of HCWs during the 1-year period following the initial pandemic outbreak in one of the largest COVID-19 hotspots globally to [1] characterize the evolution of HCWs' mental health status over the year following the initial pandemic outbreak, and [2] examine baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with resolution or persistence of mental health problems over time.
METHODS
Study Design, Setting, and Participants
We conducted a prospective cohort study in Spain as part of an ongoing longitudinal multi-national study [13] (https://

mentalnet.cl/en/home/). We collected data through an online survey at two timepoints. Baseline assessments were performed from 24th April to 22nd June 2020 (during the initial pandemic outbreak in Spain). Follow-up assessments took place between 26th January and 8th March 2021, which in Spain coincided with the third pandemic wave and with administration of COVID-19 vaccines for the majority of HCWs.
The study participants were HCWs aged 18 years and older, recruited from different outpatient and inpatient healthcare facilities, with clinical and non-clinical duties, and not necessarily involved in the direct care of COVID-19 patients. Participation was voluntary. The snowball sampling strategy was as follows. During both the baseline and follow-up assessments, key stakeholders (e.g., hospital managers, heads of worker unions) from healthcare facilities located in the study regions (Andalusia, Madrid, and Murcia) forwarded the survey link to all HCWs. Participants were also asked to forward the survey to peers in order to enhance response rates. In addition, during the follow-up period, we sent email or telephone survey reminders to baseline participants. Participants' personal and clinical data remained stored in separate datasets (e.g., pseudonymized), following European General Data Protection Regulation Standards. Baseline assessments are described elsewhere [14]. In this manuscript, we focus on participants who were assessed at follow-up only and on participants assessed at follow-up who had been assessed also during baseline procedures. We hereafter refer to these two subgroups as partial and full respondents, respectively.
All procedures contributing to this work comply with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2013. It received approval from the Hospital La Paz Ethics Committee in Madrid (Madrid, Spain), study ID 4099, and was ratified by the local ethics committees from the participating sites.
Variables
Baseline assessments included the following COVID-19-related exposures: direct involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients (yes, no), adequate access to personal protective equipment, fear of getting infected, and fear of infecting loved ones (all rated from 0 to 3).
Both baseline and follow-up assessments included the following sociodemographic and mental health outcome variables.
Sociodemographic variables: Age in years, gender (male, female), educational level (primary, secondary, or university studies), and type of job. We collapsed job types into the following categories: physicians, nurses, health technicians (e.g., nurse, X-ray, and laboratory technicians), ancillary workers (e.g., security staff, drivers, administrative staff, and cleaning staff), other HCWs (e.g., clinical psychologists, physiotherapists, and biologists), and residential support workers (e.g., from mental health assisted living facilities, nursing homes).
Mental health outcomes: Psychological stress, as measured by the validated Spanish version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) [15]; and probable depression symptoms, as measured by the validated Spanish version of

COVID-19 Impact on Healthcare Workers

the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [16]. We used widely accepted thresholds for detecting people screening positive for psychological distress (GHQ-12 higher than 2 points) [17, 18] and for depression (PHQ-9 score higher than 9 points) [19]. In addition, follow-up assessments also included posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, as measured by the Spanish 5-item version of the Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PCPTSD-5), where a total score higher than 2 points suggests probable PTSD [20]. The scale has been translated, but not validated in Spain.
Cronbach's alphas were 0.87 (95 percent CI: 0.86, 0.88) for the GHQ-12 total score; 0.89 (95 percent CI: 0.88, 0.89) for the PHQ9 total score; and 0.70 (95 percent CI: 0.68, 0.72) for the PCPTSD-5. To control for region-level cumulative COVID-19 incidence, we calculated region-specific 14-day cumulative incidence rates 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after the start of the follow-up period and, as rates were stable over time, classified regions as "high" or "low" incidence depending on whether average cumulative incidence over time points fell under or over 750 cases per 100,000 based on visual examination of region-specific cumulative incidence rates (Supplementary Figures S1, S2).
Statistical Analyses
First, we removed baseline respondents who provided informed consent but did not go on to initiate the survey (n = 95). We reported categorical variables as frequencies and valid percentages, and continuous and interval variables as either mean (standard deviation [SD]), or median (interquartile range [IQR]). Descriptive statistics were calculated separately for full and partial respondents.
Then, we used multivariable mixed-effects linear and binary logistic regression models to explore the associations between baseline variables, including sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, and educational level) and COVID-19-related exposures (i.e., direct involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients, adequate access to personal protective equipment, fear of getting infected, and fear of infecting loved ones), and follow-up mental health outcomes (i.e., psychological distress, depression symptoms, and PTSD symptoms), defined both as continuous questionnaire scores and dichotomous variables. We conducted sensitivity analyses adjusted by baseline assessments of the follow-up outcome under consideration. We used baseline GHQ-12 score for the model where follow-up PTSD was the outcome, as we did not have estimates for the latter in the baseline assessment. The GHQ-12 score, an instrument that has good convergent validity with the PC-PTSD-5 and accurately detects PTSD in primary care settings [21]. To ease the interpretability of effect estimates from binary logistic regression models (odds ratios), we dichotomized the following baseline exposure variables: adequate access to personal protective equipment (adequate vs. inadequate), fear of getting infected (not or slightly afraid vs. considerably or extremely afraid), and fear of infecting loved ones (not or slightly afraid vs. considerably or extremely afraid).
Next, we used baseline and follow-up mental health outcomes to categorize respondents into three mental health trajectories,

separately for psychological distress and for depression, according to whether they screened negative at baseline and follow-up (asymptomatic stable), positive at baseline and negative at follow-up (recovering), or positive or negative at baseline and positive at follow-up (persistently symptomatic/ worsening). For instance, if a respondent screened negative in the GHQ-12 and positive in the PHQ-9 at baseline, and subsequently screened positive in the GHQ-12 and negative in the PHQ-9 at follow-up, they would belong to the persistently symptomatic/worsening trajectory for psychological distress and to the recovering trajectory for depression. We selected these trajectory categories because of their potential implications for clinical practice.
Finally, we explored the association between baseline exposures and longitudinal psychological distress and depression trajectory membership, using multinomial regression models where asymptomatic stable was considered the reference category. Baseline exposures were age group, gender, educational level, direct involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients, adequate access to personal protective equipment (adequate vs. inadequate), fear of getting infected (not or slightly afraid vs. considerably or extremely afraid), and fear of infecting loved ones (not or slightly afraid vs. considerably or extremely afraid).
All models were adjusted for confounding based on prior causal knowledge, using direct acyclic graphs and backdoor criteria [22]. Region-level cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was entered in all models as a fixed factor. Likert-type variables were included as continuous for main analyses--following an accepted analytical approach [23]. (In a set of sensitivity analyses, we included them as dummy variables to assess whether main results were robust to potential model misspecification.) We did not impute missing data. All analyses were performed using packages dplyr, gtsummary, flextable, ggplot2, psych, multinom of R Studio for Mac (Version 1.2.5042).
RESULTS
Follow-Up Mental Health Outcomes
Of 1,807 respondents who answered the survey at follow-up (between 26th January and 25th March 2021), 1,471 (81.4%) completed the entire survey, with a median response time of 21 min. Most missing data pertained to the last section of the questionnaire, suggesting that data missingness was driven by survey extension and hence largely random. Respondents who did and did not complete the survey were comparable in terms of mean age (42 vs. 40 years, respectively) and gender distribution (78% vs. 74% female, respectively). Response rates were estimated across facilities and job types and ranged from 2.7% to 100% (see Supplementary Tables S1, S2).
There were 1,058 (59%) partial respondents (i.e., assessed only at follow-up) and 749 (41%) full respondents (i.e., assessed at both baseline and follow-up). Of note, this indicates that we retained 32% of the 2,370 original baseline respondents for follow-up assessments (see Figure 1).

Also, while most full respondents were physicians or nurses, partial respondents included a larger proportion of residential support workers.
Overall, 56% of follow-up respondents screened positive for psychological distress, 21% for probable depression, and 51% for PTSD. Psychological distress, probable depression, and PTSD

were more frequent among younger and female respondents, and respondents with higher educational levels--with substantial heterogeneity across specific job types (see Supplementary Table S3). Notably, follow-up mental health outcomes were comparable between full and partial respondents, with similar mean (SD) GHQ-12 score (3.9 [3.5] vs. 3.8 [3.4], respectively), mean (SD) PHQ-9 score (6.3 [5.1] vs. 6.4 [3.4], respectively), proportion of respondents screening positive for psychological distress (56% vs. 55%, respectively), and proportion of

respondents screening positive for probable depression (21% vs. 21%, respectively).
Comparisons Between Baseline and Follow-Up Mental Health Outcomes
Comparisons between baseline and follow-up mental health outcomes among full respondents are shown in Table 2. The

proportion of respondents screening positive for psychological distress and probable depression decreased, respectively, from 74% to 56% and from 28% to 21%. Figure 2 shows the distribution of trajectories of depression symptoms and psychological distress over time, overall and across baseline covariates. Trajectories show that, in terms of depression symptoms, 66% respondents remained asymptomatic/stable, 15% recovered, and 19% remained symptomatic or worsened over time. In terms of psychological distress, 18% respondents remained asymptomatic/stable, 26% recovered, and 56% remained symptomatic or worsened over time. The distribution of trajectories was heterogeneous across baseline covariates.
Association Between Baseline Exposures and Follow-Up Mental Health Outcomes and Trajectories
Table 3 shows crude and adjusted estimates of the association between baseline exposures and follow-up mental health outcome scores among full respondents. Overall, women had higher scores (i.e., worse mental health) than men, and job-related factors such as direct involvement in the care of COVID-19, inadequate access to protective equipment, or fear of infecting oneself or loved ones were associated with higher negative mental health outcome scores-especially for PTSD, and with higher odds of testing positive for psychological distress, probable depression, and PTSD (see Supplementary Table S4). We repeated all models, first including further adjustment by baseline mental health outcome scores (see Supplementary Tables S5, S6) and

Table 4 shows crude and adjusted associations between baseline exposures and trajectory membership for psychological distress and probable depression. Women showed higher symptom variability over time than men, as indicated by women's higher odds of belonging to both the recovering and the persistently symptomatic/worsening categories for both psychological distress and probable depression. In terms of psychological distress, reporting inadequate access to personal protective equipment was associated with persistently symptomatic/worsening category membership. In terms of probable depression, fear of infecting loved ones was associated with recovering category membership. Results did not change in models including Likert-type variables as dummy variables.
DISCUSSION
This study followed a cohort of HCWs from one of the earliest COVID-19 pandemic hotspots over the 1-year period after the initial pandemic outbreak. There was marked heterogeneity across individuals in terms of variation in mental health outcomes over time. While we detected general reductions in psychological distress (from 74% to 56%) and depression symptoms (from 28% to 21%), the overall burden of poor mental health among HCWs remained substantial 8 months after the pandemic onset (56% screened positive for psychological distress, 21% for probable depression, and 51% for PTSD). Our analysis of mental health outcome trajectories revealed that psychological distress and depression symptoms persisted or worsened over time

for 56% and 19% of respondents, respectively. We identified prospective associations between certain baseline characteristics, such as being female, reporting inadequate access to personal protective equipment, or being afraid of getting infected and of infecting loved ones, and follow-up psychological distress, depression symptoms, and PTSD symptoms. These results highlight the importance of adapting, implementing, and scaling-up evidence-based public, occupational, and mental health interventions for HCWs to prevent their mental health from further deteriorating during the ongoing pandemic and its aftermath.
Early cross-sectional studies from high-incidence COVID19 areas, such as the Chinese region of Wuhan [24], Italy [3, 5], or Spain [1], described the mental health toll taken by the pandemic on HCWs' mental health, showing remarkable rates of psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms. In our study sample, estimates of the point prevalence of depression at baseline were similar than those found in Italy (25%) and Spain (28%), probably due to similar sample characteristics and study settings. Likewise, our baseline finding that three in four respondents were psychologically distressed is nearly identical to that of Lai et al. in Wuhan at the beginning of the pandemic (late January 2020). Additionally, a series of cross-sectional studies had already reported associations between HCWs' characteristics, such as female gender, or inadequate access to personal protective equipment and negative mental health outcomes (i.e., anxiety or depression) [25-27]. Our study found these associations to persist within a prospective cohort design, lowering the risk of potential reverse causation bias and hence greatly enhancing interpretability for decision-making.

COVID-19 Impact on Healthcare Workers

Other prospective studies have sought to describe the evolution of HCWs' negative mental health outcomes over time using a variety of outcomes and follow-up periods [9-12, 27-30]. Somewhat in contrast to our results, López Steinmez and others reported a slight increase in psychological distress (from 40% to 46% point prevalence) between May and September, 2020, in a sample of 300 HCWs from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Differences in follow-up time probably accounts for this between-study difference, as they may have captured the early consequences of the initial pandemic outbreak while we conducted our assessments later, when renovated reasons for optimism (e.g., vaccine development and roll-out) had already started to emerge. Using a highly homogeneous sample of 200 nurses, Pinho and others reported stable trends in depression and decreasing trends in anxiety between April and November, 2020. Differences in sample composition make their results hardly comparable to our's. Other studies have either used much shorter follow-up periods [27, 29, 30] or reported outcomes not comparable to our's, such as insomnia [28] or job stress [12]. Our's is the first prospective cohort analysis of risk factors for negative mental health outcomes among HCWs to adjust all associations of interest for potential confounding due to area-level COVID-19 cumulative incidence, in addition to adjustment for individual-level confounding. Notably, mounting evidence suggests higher rates of negative mental health outcomes among HCWs from regions with higher incidence [31].
To our knowledge, only one study has described the trajectories of mental health problems among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic [9]. Using latent class modelling based on scores on three mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms) between May and September, 2020, they found four distinct trajectories which are remarkably similar to ours in terms of interpretation and prevalence within the study sample: 19% respondents belonged to their "recovered" group (for 15% in our recovering group), 66% to their "resilient" group (for 66% in our asymptomatic stable group), and 7% and 8%, respectively, to their "sub-chronic" and "delayed" groups (for 19% in our symptomatic/worsening group). These same trajectories have been identified is studies using latent growth mixture modelling across many different populations that have experienced adversity [32]. Notably, this previous study did not assess psychological distress. Accordingly, our surprisingly high rates of persistence or worsening of psychological distress (56% of respondents) cannot be compared to other studies. While this result does not lend itself to easy interpretation until subsequent follow-up studies using the GHQ-12 emerge, it seems plausible that a substantial proportion of HCWs may potentially beneficiate from implementation of programs to lower psychological distress.
In addition to confirming associations previously reported in cross-sectional reports, our findings expand existing evidence in impactful ways for public health and clinical decision-making. First, by including a heterogeneous sample of HCWs with and without clinical duties, our study may serve to inform strategies aimed at non-clinical workers

such as administrators or cleaners--largely overlooked in most studies examining mental health outcomes among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, our finding of scarce evidence of reliable baseline predictors of mental health outcome trajectories over time suggests that all HCWs should be offered easy-to-access mental health resources tailored to their needs (i.e., self-care and lowintensity psychotherapeutic interventions), regardless of profile in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and baseline clinical features.
Our study has limitations. First, we used a non-random sample that increases probability of some degree of collider bias and hinders transportability of study results across settings. Also, and in line with other multi-center studies [1, 4], response rates varied significantly across sites and facilities, and the possibility of self-selection bias cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, the baseline sociodemographic characteristics and mental health outcomes were however similar to another Spanish study with a larger and somewhat more representative sample of HCWs [1] and to other, similar European studies [2, 3]. Second, because of the use of observational data, effect estimates are potentially subject to some degree of residual confounding. Notably, substantial residual confounding is unlikely given that we included measures on all major individual- and region-level confounders and that estimates from crude and adjusted associations are roughly similar. Moreover, sensitivity analyses exploring differences between subsamples (e.g., full vs. partial respondents) and adjusting for baseline measurements of mental health outcomes obtained similar results, suggesting that our models were robust to different model specifications. Third, two thirds of baseline respondents were lost to follow-up. Dropout was independent from age, gender, and mental health outcomes at baseline, but people lost to follow were slightly more concerned about getting the virus and infecting their loved ones (data not shown). Fourth, limitations of self-reports for diagnostic screening are widely known [33]. In the context of HCWs' reactions to an initial pandemic outbreak, available diagnostic thresholds might have misclassified early, adaptive reactions to acute stressors as probable disorders (i.e., false positives). Notwithstanding, we used widely accepted screening instruments with good psychometric properties validated worldwide. Last, we calculated outcome trajectories based on information from two time points only. Future steps will include ascertainment of mental health outcomes in subsequent follow-up assessments and adoption of datadriven latent growth modelling approaches in addition to previously established categories based on clinical implications.
This is the first study to describe the trajectories of change of a large sample of HCWs from an early pandemic hotspot over a long follow-up period. Our results suggest preventative and restorative strategies at various levels (i.e., public, occupational, and specialized mental health), and outlines modifiable factors that might inform resource allocation, such as provision of protective equipment or being in direct care of COVID-19 patients.

Summary
Objective. The purpose of the study was to ascertain Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQOL) and evaluate oralhygiene practices in patients visiting a dental institution during COVID-19 time. Materials and methods. Face-to face interviews were conducted using a semi-structured close-ended questionnaire,assessing oral hygiene practices and self-reported oral problems perceived in last 6 months, using both Hindi and English version of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) Questionnaire. Frequency distribution of oral hygiene practices were obtained, and Descriptive statistics computed the scores of OHIP-14. Kruskal-wallis test and Independent t-test were used to match the association of OHIP-14 with demographic variables. Multiple linear regression

analysis was utilized to compute the association of OHIP-14 with independent variables, age and gender. Results. Subjective evaluation of OHRQOL (Oral Health Related Quality of Life) using OHIP-14 Porforma resulted in high score for physical pain and psychological discomfort but subjects expressed less discomfort in connection to functional limitation, physical disability, psychological discomfort, social disability and handicap domains of OHIP-14. With progressive increase in age OHRQOL worsened. Females had poor OHRQOL, with significant difference as compared to males. Gender and marital status observed variance in OHIP-14 with statistically significant difference (P <0.000). Conclusion. More than two-third subjects preferred cleaning their teeth using toothbrush and toothpaste. Therefore, COVID-
19 consequently impacted OHRQOL of the general population.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) constituted unparalleled challenge to the humanity. WHO asserted COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern on 30th January 2020 and on 11th March 2020 it was announced pandemic. The pandemic has left an ineradicable mark impacting people's life physically, mentally, socially and economically [1]. To break the chain of transmission people were commanded to stay at home by dictating a countrywide lockdown on 24th March 2020 which lasted for more than 8 weeks [2]. The lockdown prohibited people from moving out of their dwellings. Work from home culture was adopted and nearly all educational institutions were closed. Few reports dawned on ramifications of COVID-19 on oral health [3]. The fright of succumbing to COVID-19 heightened during pandemic and as a result many people might have delayed their routine dental care. The medications and therapies used for treating coronavirus disease might have affected oral health resulting in xerostomia, stomatitis and mouth ulcers because of impaired immune system [3]. Since COVID-19 restricted physical movement this evolved in accumulation of dental problems for instance dental sensitivity, pain, bleeding from gums, onset of oral ulcers, salty sensation in mouth, oral malador, need for restoration, need of

artificial prosthesis and need for removal of teeth [4]. Those affected with COVID-19 could be at danger of contracting oral lesions such as white-hairy tongue, necrotic lesions, reddish macules and haemorrhagic ulcerations. Further poor compromised oral hygiene may cause aspiration of bacteria in oral cavity leading in inflammation of respiratory tract [5]. The earlier notion of Health defined by WHO `Health being a state of complete physical, mental and social well being and not merely absence of disease or infirmity' [6] has changed over the course of time, now health is intermingledwith general health and people's quality of life (QOL) [7]. Now a robust approach has been conceived called Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQOL) that estimates accordingly oral conditions influencing individual's attitude and social functioning [6]. US Department of Health and Human Services defines OHRQOL as a multidimensional constructwhich ponders upon people's comfort when eating, sleeping and engaging in social interaction; their pride; and their contentment with respect to their oral health. OHRQOL also deals with functional factors, psychological factors, social factors, and experience of pain [8, 9] Dental disturbances profoundly influence our social quality of life affecting mentally, emotionally and physically [1013] An estimated 3.5 billion people are believed to be disturbed due to oral disease.

Oral disease induces pain, discomfort supplemented with severe periodontal disease [6]. The in-built reluctance to seek dental care due to COVID-19 scare and physical restrictions would have certainly influenced the OHRQOL [14]. Despite previous voluminous research done assessing OHRQOL in patients affected with dental disorders still fewer studies might have been initiated to assess the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on OHRQOL. Thus, the motive of this study was to explore Oral Health Related Quality of Life and observance of oral hygiene practices in patients visiting dental OPD during COVID-19.

2.11.2020 to conduct the cross-sectional study. The participants were interviewed face-to-face for OHRQOL, using Oral Health Impact Profile-14 questionnaire (OHIP-14) and oral hygiene practices were evaluated using a semi-structured questionnaire. OHIP-14 is based on theoretical model developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and calculates social impact of oral disorders. OHIP-14 focuses on 7 dimensions which consist of functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability and handicap. It gives more prominence to behavioural and psychological impact and is preferred in identifying psychological impact among individuals. The Responses were obtained using 5-point likert scale. Scores ranged from 0 to 56 and were obtained by adding the ordinal values for the 14 items. Higher OHIP-14 scores coincides to poor OHRQOL and lesser scores predict better OHRQOL. For an expected population size of 29,911, the sample size of 391 was determined using online sample size calculator [15] with confidence level set at 0.95 and margin of error at 5%. Thus, 391 subjects reporting to OPD were enquired for OHRQOL and oral hygiene practices using close-ended questionnaire. The respondents were interviewed, how often they felt oral problems over past 6 months using a validated English and Hindi version of OHIP-14. Reliability of OHIP scale was assessed before commencement with cronbach's alpha value  = 0.67 considered acceptable. Subjects who had at least 20 functional teeth were evaluated and completely edentulous subjects were excluded.
Statistical Analysis
The data obtained was subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS Version 21.0 Armonk,NY:IBM Corp [16]. Descriptive statistics were computed for demographic variables and oral hygiene practices. Comparison of OHIP-14 in relation to age, gender and marital status was done using Kruskal-Wallis Test and Independentt test. Chi-square test observed the association of oral hygiene practices with gender. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to substantiate the association between independent variables, such as gender and marital status with dependent variable (OHIP-14).

Results
Total of 391 subjects reporting in OPD were evaluated for oral hygiene practices and OHRQOL. The mean age was 35.13 ± 2.49 years out of which 63.7% (249) were males and 36.3% (142) were females. More than two-third were in the habit of cleaning their teeth using toothbrush and toothpaste. Nevertheless, a small proportion of subjects used finger (4.4%), treestick (2.8%) and interdental brush (0.5%) for cleaning. Four-fifth of the participants were unable to comprehend between fluoridated and nonfluoridated toothpaste. 82.6% maintained daily cleaning of their tongue and 79.3% practiced brushing their teeth before intake of meals. Practice of cleaning teeth, twice a day was observed in only 20.5% subjects. About a quarter of study subjects (29.3%) reported the use of desensitizing toothpaste and non-fluoridated toothpaste and greater than two-third of subjects (66.7%) trusted

Colgate toothpaste for cleaning their teeth (Tab. I). Out of the seven dimensions of OHIP-14 the subjects rated higher mean score for physical pain (3.53 ± 2.26) and psychological discomfort (1.21 ± 2.03) (Tab. II). However, less discomfort was perceived in relation to functional limitation, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability and handicap (Tab. III). The total OHIP-14 score ranged between 0 to 29. Females had higher mean OHIP-14 score (8.96 ± 5.57) in comparison with males (6.52 ± 3.60). Females perceived more discomfort in OHRQOL when compared to males with significant differences seen in domains of psychological discomfort, physical disability, social disability and handicap. Similarly females beingmore conscious for their oral health, felt more tense because of problems with their teeth (P < 0.001). Inter-group comparisongender wise observed significant difference in context to unsatisfactory diet and inability to consume meals. (Tab. IV).

Gender wise non-significant association was obtained in comparing usage of oral hygiene materials. However, males showed significant difference in relation to oral cleanliness aids used for cleaning their teeth (P < 0.08) (Tab. V). Significant differences were drawn, age-wise in connection to physical pain and psychological discomfort (Tab. VI). Symbolic association was reported in married subjects, when compared with unmarried subjects in relation to domains of physical pain (P < 0.001) and physical disability. Yet, unmarried subjects were more self-conscious and uncomfortable for their oral problems (Tab. VII). On conducting multiple regression analysis both gender and marital status predicted OHIP-14 in a statistically significant manner F (2,388) = 18.164, P < 0.001 R2 = 0.081 (Tab. VIII).
Discussion
The overall mean OHIP-14 Score 7.41 ± 4.56 was much lower in comparison to earlier studies measuring OHRQOL [10, 17-20] which could be associated with better awareness about oral health.Females under prioritized their oral health which could be because of more involvement in household work, dependence

on spouses and laid back attitude towards seeking immediate treatment which was in disagreement with previous studies where females utilized oral care services [10, 18]. Similarly, females subjects in this studyreported poor OHRQL which could be linked with rural background, hormonal imbalances and systemic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease which are known to affect oral health [21]. Almost 90% of subjects reported the use of toothpaste and toothbrush and this observation was in agreement with previous studies [22, 23], still 7.8% subjects relied on traditional practices such as tree stick and finger. One-third (8.3%) revealed the use of desensitizing toothpastes which was higher when compared to earlier evidence [22, 24] and the probable reason could be readily available OTC toothpastes and media promotion of desensitizing toothpastes. Only 4.6% study subjects were accustomed to cleaning their teeth using toothpowder which differed with earlier study [23] however, similar observation was noted in a study from central India [22]. Only 20.5% of subjects reported cleaning of their teeth twice a day and this low proportion was comparable to previous studies [22, 23]. High mean scores for physical pain and psychological discomfort were reported with consistent findings from earlier research [10, 19, 25] and gender based differences were in concordance with a study done in

similar setting [18] but contradictory findings were seen in a study done on occupational workers [25]. Less than one-third of study subjects very often felt pain and discomfort on eating food, however, more than one-third subjects occasionally had pain in their mouth because of difficulty with their teeth/ mouth and this finding matched with previous studies [18, 26]. Majority of the respondents never experienced their diet to be unsatisfactory. The subjects were very often less self-conscious about their oral problems and this observation was similar to previous studies [18, 20] but in disagreement with earlier research [17].

In spite of pandemic, very few subjects felt irritable, observed difficulty in doing their daily routine work and sensed life in general less satisfying which differed from observations drawn from earlier studies [10, 12, 20]. Nearly half of the subjects occasionally were unable to eat food because of difficulty with their teeth which could be associated with nutritional imbalance [12]. The advancing age increased the severity of OHRQOL as shown by increased scores more so in patients affected with systemic and co morbid conditions [17, 18, 2527]. Elderly witnessed increased suffering associated with physical pain and psychological discomfort which

attributed to anxiety in undergoing dental treatment and fear for overall wellbeing during COVID-19 [20]. Notably the marital status influenced the OHRQOL which is line with earlier explorations [17, 19]. Gender and marital status observed significant variance in OHIP-14 and a similar association was predicted in a study done on occupational workers [23]. The inference that can be drawn from these points is that married people in general ignore their oral health and need to prioritize this aspect of their life. Although patients oral problems accumulated during COVID-19 time but the extent and severity of their oral problems was not as much when compared with earlier studies assessing the OHRQOL [10, 17, 19, 26].
Limitations Cross-sectional pattern of this study had certain constraints, such as the subjects might have experienced difficulty in recalling oral problems and this resulted in underestimation of oral problems. No correlation was conducted between OHRQOL and clinical parameters, for instance dental caries and periodontal disease. Social desirability bias could also be one of the contributing factor yielding low scores of OHIP-14, because the participants might have shown inhibition in discussing their oral health during COVID-19. We did not estimate the OHRQOL in subjects who were wearing artificial prosthesis and in those who were completely edentulous.
Conclusion
COVID-19 instilled fear among the general public resulting in delayed approach to seek dental treatment which was responsible for physical pain and psychological discomfort in context to oral problems perceived by the patients. Therefore COVID-19 pandemic may escalate oral health problems which if deferred may result in long-term implications on oral health of general population.

Abstract
Background: Online consultations (OCs) allow patients to contact their care providers on the web. Worldwide, OCs have been rolled out in primary care rapidly owing to policy initiatives and COVID-19. There is a lack of evidence regarding how OC design and implementation influence care quality.
Objective: We aimed to synthesize research on the impacts of OCs on primary care quality, and how these are influenced by system design and implementation.
Methods: We searched databases from January 2010 to February 2022. We included quantitative and qualitative studies of real-world OC use in primary care. Quantitative data were transformed into qualitative themes. We used thematic synthesis informed by the Institute of Medicine domains of health care quality, and framework analysis informed by the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability framework. Strength of evidence was judged using the GRADE-CERQual approach.
Results: We synthesized 63 studies from 9 countries covering 31 OC systems, 14 (22%) of which used artificial intelligence; 41% (26/63) of studies were published from 2020 onward, and 17% (11/63) were published after the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no quantitative evidence for negative impacts of OCs on patient safety, and qualitative studies suggested varied perceptions of their safety. Some participants believed OCs improved safety, particularly when patients could describe their queries using free text. Staff workload decreased when sufficient resources were allocated to implement OCs and patients used them for simple problems or could describe their queries using free text. Staff workload increased when OCs were not integrated with other software or organizational workflows and patients used them for complex queries. OC systems that required patients to describe their queries using multiple-choice questionnaires increased workload for patients and staff. Health costs decreased when patients used OCs for simple queries and increased when patients used them for complex queries. Patients using OCs were more likely

to be female, younger, and native speakers, with higher socioeconomic status. OCs increased primary care access for patients with mental health conditions, verbal communication difficulties, and barriers to attending in-person appointments. Access also increased by providing a timely response to patients' queries. Patient satisfaction increased when using OCs owing to better primary care access, although it decreased when using multiple-choice questionnaire formats.
Conclusions: This is the first theoretically informed synthesis of research on OCs in primary care and includes studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. It contributes new knowledge that, in addition to having positive impacts on care quality such as increased access, OCs also have negative impacts such as increased workload. Negative impacts can be mitigated through appropriate OC system design (eg, free text format), incorporation of advanced technologies (eg, artificial intelligence), and integration into technical infrastructure (eg, software) and organizational workflows (eg, timely responses).

Introduction
Background
Online consultation (OC) systems allow patients to contact their health care provider over the internet to ask health-related questions and report symptoms [1]. Their query may then be resolved with a written response, telephone call, video consultation, or in-person visit. Many terms are used to describe this type of technology, including e-consultation, e-visit, and online triage (Multimedia Appendix 1 [2-28])--in this review, we refer to them all as online consultations. We distinguish OCs from "symptom checkers" [29] and other self-service systems that typically do not directly facilitate communication with a human health care provider and from patient portals [30], which may include generic email or secure messaging functionalities.
OCs are considered by policy makers in many countries as a way to address the increasing workload and decreasing workforce capacity in primary care [31-36] while still meeting patient expectations and improving access [37]. However, they have the potential to exacerbate health inequities [38,39] and increase inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions [40]. Furthermore, there are widely recognized challenges in initiating and sustaining the adoption of new technologies in primary care [41].
Although symptom checkers [29,42] and patient portals [30,43,44] have been well studied, only a small number of evidence syntheses directly relevant to OCs have been published: a systematic review of 57 articles on delivering "e-consultation" in primary care largely focused on generic stand-alone applications such as email and video (n=39/57, 68%) [45]; a scoping review of "online triage tools" included 13 papers, 4 of which (31%) were nonempirical (eg, opinion pieces) [46]; and a review of 17 studies of "intelligent online triage tools" focused only on those that used "artificial intelligence" (AI) [47].
Since these syntheses were conducted, OCs have gained wider traction in clinical practice worldwide--they have been indispensable in helping manage patients remotely to minimize the spread of COVID-19 [48,49], and English primary care

providers have been mandated to offer OCs for all patients since April 2020 [50]. Moreover, OC system product design has progressed significantly to become more specialized and technologically advanced [51], with several more empirical research studies published on their use [2-11,52-64].
Given this rapid scale-up and increase in the diversity and complexity of OCs, further insight is needed into their impact on health care quality. Previous reviews have not reported the design or implementation details of the OCs they studied [45-47] despite their importance in understanding the causal mechanisms of how they affect care outcomes [65]. The aim of this study was to systematically review and synthesize the empirical quantitative and qualitative literature in a theoretically informed way to address this knowledge gap.
Objectives Informed by existing theories, the aim of this study was to synthesize quantitative and qualitative research on (1) the impacts of OCs on primary care quality and (2) how these are influenced by OC system design and implementation.
Methods
Study Design We consider OCs as complex interventions and, therefore, synthesized both quantitative and qualitative evidence to understand their impacts in specific contexts [66]. We did not perform a meta-analysis because of the heterogeneous and nonrandomized nature of the included studies [67]. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement [68].
Registration and Protocol The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020191802) [69]. The original title was amended to be less general and more specific to the objectives of the review, and the objectives were amended to focus on care quality.
Inclusion Criteria Papers that met the following criteria were included: empirical studies using quantitative or qualitative methods to examine the

real-world use of OCs in primary care in any country, written in English, and published in 2010 or later. We excluded news articles, opinion pieces, literature reviews, non-English-language articles, and literature published before 2010.
We defined OCs as digital interventions that allow patients to contact their primary care provider by inputting "queries" into health care-specific web-based forms [1]. We included symptom checkers and similar self-service systems [54] if at least one of their outcomes directly facilitated contact with a primary care health professional. We included patient portals if they had a secure messaging functionality that used health care-specific forms [54]. We excluded stand-alone generic communication technologies such as email or videoconferencing software.
Search Strategy
We searched the Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases during July 2020 (Multimedia Appendix 2 [12,53,56,58-60,63,70-73]). Our search strategy was developed from scoping searches of the literature and drew on search strategies used in related literature reviews [45,46]. We searched the National Technical Information Service, the Health Management Information Consortium, and Zetoc to find relevant gray literature, conference proceedings, and theses. We found further literature through citation mapping and in the reference lists of the included papers, searching during August 2020 and September 2020. SD and TC independently screened titles and abstracts and then full papers for eligibility, resolving differences through discussion at each stage. All literature searches were rerun by SD between November 2021 and February 2022.
Data Extraction and Quality Appraisal
We extracted data from the included papers as verbatim text, capturing study characteristics (eg, research design and study setting) and key findings relevant to our research objectives based on the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) framework [74] (Multimedia Appendix 3). We used the NASSS to capture "a rich, contextualised narrative of technology-supported change efforts and the numerous interacting influences that help explain its successes, failures, and unexpected events" [75]. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), which is designed for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies [76]. We scored each paper using recommended quintile percentages as cutoffs and considered any paper scoring at least 60% as of "good" quality [77]. SD and TC extracted data from 10 papers independently, which confirmed high interrater agreement. Following this, SD extracted data from the remaining papers, which were checked by TC.
Data Synthesis
The data were imported into NVivo (version 12; QSR International) [78] for synthesis. To integrate both quantitative and qualitative data, during data synthesis, quantitative data were transformed into qualitative themes ("qualitising") [79].
For objective 1, we considered "impacts of OCs on primary care quality" as consequences of using OCs that could relate to

patients, primary care staff, or the wider system [65]. We used thematic synthesis [80], which involved SD and TC coding the text from the data extraction forms independently line by line, developing higher-level themes through regular discussion [80]. Impacts on care quality were synthesized inductively, with emerging themes mapped to the six Institute of Medicine domains of health care quality [81]: safe (avoiding harm to patients from care that is intended to help), effective (providing care based on scientific knowledge to produce better clinical outcomes), patient-centered (care that is respectful and responsive), timely (reducing waits and delays for those who receive and give care), efficient (avoiding waste), and equitable (care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics) [81]. Our emergent findings suggested that OCs had both positive and negative impacts and, therefore, theme descriptions were edited to be neutral (eg, safesafety and efficientefficiency).
For objective 2, we considered OC "design" as material properties of an OC, such as features and functionality [74], and "implementation" as the way an OC was introduced and used in a particular context [65]. As a design feature, we considered AI as the ability of machines to "mimic human intelligence as characterized by behaviors such as cognitive ability, memory, learning, and decision making" [82]. We synthesized the extracted data using framework analysis [83], which involved SD and TC reading and rereading each data extraction form and then coding them line by line independently--both deductively by using domains from the NASSS framework [74] for high-level themes and inductively by identifying additional subthemes. Through discussion, SD and TC summarized the findings into five high-level themes: condition complexity (health condition and the illness the OC is used for), technology (material properties of the OC and required knowledge for use), adopters (staff, patients, and carers expected to use the OC), organization (extent of work needed for implementation of the OC, capacity, and readiness), and wider system (policy context) [74]. Two NASSS domains--value proposition (value of the OC to the developer, patients, and health care system) and embedding and adaptation over time (learning and adaptation to changing contexts)--had limited applicability to our findings and were not included in the final synthesis. Informed by realistic evaluation [65], we considered our themes as contextual factors and identified patterns of explanations for how each led to the impacts on care quality from objective 1 (ie, "causal mechanisms"). Where appropriate, we considered the levels of OC adoption as a mechanism for how they affected care quality [65]. We used visual mapping to identify commonalities and discordances in causal mechanisms--first within individual papers and then across papers [83]. Where there were discordances, we explored potential explanations where possible (eg, related to the study setting).
The strength and quality of our findings for objectives 1 and 2 were assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation-Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research method [84]. This accounts for the methodological limitations of the contributing papers (according to MMAT assessments),

relevance to the review question, coherence of the finding, and adequacy of its supporting data [84]. Confidence in each finding was designated as high, moderate, low, or very low. At each stage of the analysis, the findings were discussed and agreed upon with the wider study team. BCB reviewed all coded verbatim excerpts from the papers included in the final synthesis.
Results
Descriptive Summary We synthesized 63 papers (Figure 1), including 52 (83%) journal papers [53], 7 (11%) evaluation reports [85], 3 (5%) conference papers [12], and 1 (2%) master's degree thesis [13]. The studies were quantitative (33/63, 52%), qualitative (12/63, 19%), and

mixed methods (18/63, 29%) and analyzed data from patients (16/63, 25% qualitative studies and 18/63, 29% quantitative studies), staff (22/63, 35% qualitative studies and 9/63, 14% quantitative studies), and clinical systems (33/63, 52% quantitative studies). All were set in one of 9 high-income countries, with most coming from the United States (21/63, 33%) and the United Kingdom (20/63, 32%; Multimedia Appendix 4 [2-27,52-64,70-73,77,85-104]). In all, 41% (26/63) of the studies were published in 2020 or later, and 17% (11/63) were conducted after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Examples of excluded studies are those that focused on stand-alone video consultations [105], involved communication between physicians and not patients [106], and were not based on primary care [107].

In all, 83% (52/63) of the studies reported levels of OC adoption by patients and staff, of which 62% (32/52; 32/63, 51% of all studies) were described as "low" by the study authors [86]. OCs were adopted at a high rate in 63% (33/52; 33/63, 52% of all) of the studies [87], including high rates of adoption by certain patient groups even when overall OC adoption in the study was low [14].
The included papers described 31 OC systems summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Multimedia Appendix 5 [2-27,52-64,70-73,85-104]. In 25% (16/63) of the papers, the OC system was described sufficiently to meet our inclusion criteria but not in enough detail to determine specific design features. Of the 31 OCs described, most (23/31, 74%) offered two-way written communication between patients and staff [88], with a few (4/31, 13%) also offering communication by video [52]. In all, 13% (4/31) did not provide functionalities for staff to reply to patients via the system (ie, one-way communication only [14]). In total, 35% (11/31) required patients to describe their queries solely via multiple-choice questionnaires (MCQs) [89] compared with 13% (4/31) that solely required patients to describe their queries using unstructured free text [56]. In all, 42% (13/31) had a hybrid

approach of primarily using MCQs with the option for patients to enter additional free text [90]. No free text OCs offered optional MCQs. In all, 26% (8/31) of the OC systems were integrated with the electronic health record (EHR) [58], and 3% (1/31) allowed patients to schedule telephone or in-person appointments with health care professionals themselves [54].
In total, 54% (13/24) of MCQ-based OC systems exhibited three types of AI: (1) adapting questions they asked patients as they submitted their query in response to previous answers given (10/31, 32%) [91]; (2) prioritizing patient queries based on clinical urgency (4/31, 13%) [54]; and (3) signposting patients to an appropriate care provider based on their query, such as self-care, primary care, or emergency department (3/31, 10%) [8]. These were mostly powered by preprogrammed logic and "algorithms" (10/31, 32%) [54], with the exact AI methodology unclear in the remainder (3/31, 10%) [15].
The methodological quality of most studies (42/63, 67%) was "good" (ie, 60% according to the MMAT [77]; Multimedia Appendix 6 [2-27,52-64,70-73,76,85-104]). Common limitations included a lack of detail on whether the OC was administered as intended [92] and small sample sizes [3].

Objective 1: Impacts of OCs on Primary Care Quality
Safety
In 27% (17/63) of the studies, staff and patients expressed general concerns about the impact of OCs on patient safety, particularly regarding the potential loss of information from patients versus in-person or telephone consultations and how it could lead to misdiagnosis [55]. However, quantitative evidence from 17% (11/63) of the studies did not support these concerns in terms of emergency department attendance rates [92],

hospitalizations [70], deaths [88], and other measures [59]. Furthermore, clinicians and patients in 22% (14/63) of the studies believed that OCs improved patient safety, for example, by producing a detailed shared written record of consultations [93] and helping reduce the spread of communicable diseases such as COVID-19 [63].

Effectiveness
In 6% (4/63) of the studies, antibiotics were prescribed to patients at a lower rate via OCs compared with in-person consultations [60].
Timeliness
In 46% (29/63) of the studies, OCs were perceived as increasing access to primary care services. It was easier and more convenient to make initial contact as patients could submit an OC query at any time without waiting on the phone or attending in person [14]. Once a query was submitted, patients also communicated with health professionals sooner as OCs tended to circumvent the traditional appointment-booking process [57].
Efficiency
In total, 52% (33/63) of the studies suggested that the workload decreased for both staff and patients when using OCs. Patient queries were written rather than spoken, incoming phone calls to receptionists were reduced [16], and patient histories did not need manual documentation [93]. Written queries were usually more detailed than when communicated verbally and were received by health care staff asynchronously, thus providing opportunities for more objective examination and more effective triage. Consequently, patient queries could more often be directed to other services or dealt with by other staff members rather than always by physicians [3]. Combined with their remote nature, OCs also gave staff more autonomy over how their work was organized, thus providing efficiency gains such as working from home and control over how to contact a patient rather than defaulting to an in-person consultation [13]. When telephone or in-person consultations were necessary, they were more focused and, therefore, quicker as the staff member could read the patient query before contact [17]. OCs reduced the workload for patients by avoiding the need to telephone their primary care provider to make an appointment, which often entailed long queues [18], and avoiding in-person consultations when possible, which typically involved travel, waiting rooms, and organizing time off work and childcare [15].
In contrast, 46% (29/63) of the studies suggested that OCs increased the workload for staff and patients. Staff described conducting OCs on top of their usual tasks [13] and dealing with them outside normal working hours [19]. They believed that, because OCs increased access to primary care, patients sought help more readily than they would have previously [17], thus creating "supply-induced demand" [108]. Processing OCs also created new administrative work such as filing them to EHRs and deciding whether they required input from a clinician [86]. Workload could also increase for patients if they perceived that entering their query into the OC system was more difficult than explaining it verbally [20].
OCs decreased costs for providers in 32% (20/63) of the studies largely by reducing in-person visits, which have associated expenditures related to staffing and utilities [21]. Patients reported that, owing to their convenience, having access to OCs stopped them from visiting other costly unscheduled care providers [92]. OCs decreased costs for patients in 6% (4/63) of the studies by avoiding in-person visits, which may entail

expenses related to travel, unpaid work leave, and childcare [57].
In contrast, OCs increased costs for providers in 14% (9/63) of the studies owing to associated technology costs [63], time required for clinicians to triage patient queries [22], and insufficient reduction of in-person visits or telephone consultations [87].
Equitable
In all, 65% (41/63) of the studies suggested that OCs decreased equitable access to care services, as their use varied according to patient characteristics [63]. Conversely, 30% (19/63) of the studies suggested that OCs increased equitable access as they helped particular groups of patients who had previously struggled communicate with their primary care providers [14]. These characteristics are discussed in more detail in the Adopters section.
Patient-Centeredness
Although 21% (13/63) of the studies uncovered some patient dissatisfaction with OCs [90], 49% (31/63) found that most patients were at least as satisfied or more satisfied with OCs than with traditional in-person appointments [2]. Patients liked OCs for the aforementioned reasons: they improved access (timeliness), reduced their workload and costs (efficiency), and helped particular groups of patients communicate with their care providers (equitable).
Objective 2: How the Impacts of OCs on Primary Care Quality Are Influenced by System Design and Implementation
Condition Complexity
In all, 17% (11/63) of the studies suggested that OCs decreased staff workload when used for simple queries that were straightforward to resolve as they were more amenable to completion without needing to contact the patient directly via telephone or in person [5]. Simple queries included those related to administrative tasks, new and recurrent minor acute illnesses, prescriptions, tests, requests for advice, follow-up, and some chronic condition reviews [56]. These queries also decreased health costs as they saved clinicians time, for example, when administrative staff were able to relay messages and there was no direct contact between physician and patient [23]. In all, 11% (7/63) of the studies suggested that OCs increased staff workload and costs when used for complex queries such as those with multiple ill-defined symptoms [17]. These queries generally required verbal dialogue with and physical examination of the patient and were usually converted to telephone or in-person consultations to assess the patient further [23]. Staff felt that this duplicated the number of contacts with the patient for the same query.
Technology
In all, 21% (13/63) of the studies showed that, when patients had to use MCQs to input their OC query, it increased both patient and staff workload. Filling out long lists of questions shifted work from the clinician to the patient [20], and staff found them burdensome to read [86]. MCQs limited the amount of detail patients could enter, so staff could not always fully

understand their request. This increased workload as they often had to contact the patient to obtain further information [23]. MCQs also asked questions about seemingly "irrelevant" symptoms, which staff were responsible for assessing and following up, diverting attention from the patient's primary concern [10]. Owing to the restrictive nature of MCQs, patients regularly adapted their responses to obtain the outcome they wanted even when it was not the most appropriate use of resources. For example, reporting their symptoms differently to obtain an in-person consultation when self-care may have been more suitable ("gaming") [17].
In all, 14% (9/63) of the studies suggested that MCQs could also decrease patient satisfaction. Reasons included the amount of work required to complete them [14], their inflexibility in obtaining the answers patients wanted from their primary care provider [9], and that they could be confusing to navigate [25].
In contrast, 11% (7/63) of the studies suggested that, when patients could primarily report their queries using unstructured free text, it decreased staff workload and increased patient safety. This was because patients were more able to fully describe their query in sufficient detail using their own words, and clinicians did not have to request further information as often [95].
In 10% (6/63) of the studies, two-way written communication within the OC decreased the workload for both staff and patients. The ability to reply to patients in writing meant queries could be answered and follow-up questions could be asked at times convenient to both staff and patients, avoiding lengthy telephone and in-person consultations when appropriate [55]. It was also easier to communicate complex information, for example, by sending educational materials or using preset message templates [95].
In all, 21% (13/63) of the studies highlighted that a lack of integration between the OC system and other core software used by providers increased staff workload. Nonintegration meant that the staff had to go through multiple steps to perform a task, such as when filing an OC to a patient's EHR [21].
Adopters
Patients using OCs were more likely to be female (27/63, 43%) [70], younger (27/63, 43%) [91], and native speakers of the official language of the country they lived in (7/63, 11%) [25] and have a higher socioeconomic status (11/63, 17%) [57] than those not using OCs, thus decreasing equity. In contrast, both staff and patients felt that OCs increased access for particular groups of patients who struggled with traditional consultation methods, thus increasing equity and satisfaction with care. This included patients with mental health conditions who became anxious when speaking to health professionals on the telephone or in person (8/63, 13%) [20]; patients with verbal communication difficulties such as hearing loss who found it easier to communicate in writing (7/63, 11%) [90]; and patients with barriers to attending in-person appointments because of physical disabilities, geography, work commitments, or care responsibilities (8/63, 13%) [23]. In all, 13% (8/63) of the studies suggested that when staff and patients viewed traditional

in-person methods as the gold standard, it could lead to resistance in adopting OCs [19].
Organization
In all, 8% (5/63) of the studies found that, when OCs were minimally advertised to patients, it understandably led to low rates of adoption [24]. In all, 11% (7/63) of the studies also showed that responding to a patient's initial OC query quickly led to high patient satisfaction, as it provided an advantage over traditional methods of primary care contact [6]; by definition, this also increased primary care access.
In all, 21% (13/63) of the studies found that the staff workload increased when providers did not integrate OCs into their normal daily workflows. For example, not scheduling time for clinicians to deal with OCs meant that they were done in addition to their normal tasks [93], and not diverting all incoming patient demand via the OC meant that different communication routes were often used for the same issue, thereby duplicating work [5]. In all, 13% (8/63) of the studies suggested that provider workload decreased if sufficient resources were allocated to implementing OCs. This included their initial setup--for example, training to enable staff to more effectively handle OCs [15]--and their ongoing processing--for example, dedicated facilities such as quiet rooms to help staff respond to OCs without distraction [55].
In all, 8% (5/63) of the studies showed that a lack of continuity of care between patients and their known physician negatively affected patient satisfaction. This occurred when any physician could reply to an OC query and patients were not able to specify a physician to whom to address their query [64].
Wider System
In all, 10% (6/63) of the studies showed that government policies mandating OC use increased their adoption. Example policies aimed to increase digital modes of contact with primary care in general [87] and minimize in-person contact during the COVID-19 pandemic [63]. In all, 8% (5/63) of the studies demonstrated that a lack of long-term external financial support for OCs limited their sustainability as health care organizations could often not afford to pay their ongoing costs [23].
Discussion
Summary of Evidence
This review focused on how OCs affect primary care quality, as defined by Institute of Medicine domains, for patients, providers, and the wider system, as well as which factors, as specified through the NASSS framework, influence this quality. We synthesized qualitative and quantitative evidence from 63 studies conducted in 9 countries covering 31 OC systems described in detail, with wide-ranging functionalities including AI. In all, 41% (26/63) of the studies were published in 2020 onward, and 17% (11/63) were published after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our main findings were that OCs are safe and have positive impacts on care quality, including increased access to care and decreased patient costs. However, they can have conflicting impacts on provider costs, staff and patient workloads, patient satisfaction, and care equity. We found that

Darley et al

the impacts OCs have on care quality are determined by the complexity of the patient queries they are used for, the design of the OC technology itself, the characteristics of staff and patient users, the way OCs are implemented by health care providers, and wider health policies.
Comparison of Findings With Other Reviews
Consistent with previous reviews relevant to OCs, we found a limited demographic of patients using OCs, leading to potential inequitable care [45,46]. We also found that the studies often did not sufficiently explore patients' perspectives of OCs in depth [46]; only 14% (9/63) of the studies used interview-based methods with an average sample size of 24.5 (SD 10.14). This hampered efforts to understand how such inequities arose.
Contrary to previous reviews, we found that OC impacts on care quality are more complex and nuanced than previously reported [45-47]. For example, we identified mixed findings regarding their impact on workload, patient satisfaction, and equitable care. This contrasts with previous reviews, where OCs only increased [47] or had no impact [45] on workload, decreased patient safety [45,47], and increased inequity [45-47].
These new findings for OCs may be partly explained because 76% (48/63) of the included studies had not been covered by these previous reviews. Although there was some overlap of papers (7/57, 12% of papers [45]; 7/13, 54% of papers [46]; and 4/17, 24% of papers [47]), most did not meet our inclusion criteria as they were either nonempirical (4/57, 7% [45]; 4/13, 31% [46]; and 4/17, 24% [47]), published before 2010 (26/57, 46% [45] and 2/17, 12% [47]), not based on real-world primary care (16/57, 28% [45]; 1/13, 8% [46]; and 6/17, 35% [47]), or did not meet our functional definition of an OC (39/57, 68% [45]; 2/13, 15% [46]; and 6/17, 35% [47]; eg, symptom checkers with no link to a health professional [28]).
By focusing on design and implementation, we identified new ways in which OCs affect primary care quality. For example, we found that, by increasing access, OCs can increase staff workload by creating "supply-induced demand" [17,108] and that they can decrease workload by enabling more focused consultations [17]. Furthermore, as previous reviews often did not analyze the design or implementation of OCs [45-47], we identified influential factors that have not been previously described. For example, although some reviews identified increased workload when clinicians received insufficient patient information via an OC system [46], we found that this was particularly associated with MCQ-based OCs [23]. We identified

that allowing patients to describe their queries using unstructured free text had the opposite effect [95] while also having a positive impact on patient safety [55]. Using unstructured free text means that patients can more fully describe their query in addition to allowing them to freely express their ideas, concerns, and expectations, as is common in patient-centered primary care consultations [109].
Strengths and Limitations
As evidenced by the range of examples in Multimedia Appendix 1, we adopted a fundamental functional definition of OCs rather than relying on the names given to them by the authors of the included studies. When combined with our comprehensive searches across multiple databases and inclusion of gray literature, we identified more empirical studies relevant to OCs than any previous evidence synthesis on the topic [45-47]. Combined with our focus on causal mechanisms, this helped us develop a new and theoretically informed understanding of OCs that has not been previously reported.
As in all systematic reviews, our synthesis is reliant on what the study authors reported. OC features were not always described in sufficient detail to understand how they affected care quality [62]. There was also a lack of patient perspective in the studies, particularly from OC nonusers [4]. We made our literature search strategy as inclusive as possible regarding the different terms used for OCs (Multimedia Appendix 1) but, owing to their wide-ranging nature, it is possible that some papers were missed. We updated our searches between November 2021 and February 2022 to capture more recently published studies but, owing to time constraints, only 1 author (SD) screened these newer papers. This enabled us to capture studies conducted in the context of COVID-19 (11/63, 17% of all included studies).
Implications for Practice and Research
Overview
Our findings show that the impacts of OCs on care quality are complex and can be influenced by the subtle ways in which OCs are designed and implemented. To maximize their benefit for patients and staff, we therefore provide recommendations for OC developers on how systems could be designed, health care organizations on how they can be implemented and used, and researchers on questions and areas for further investigation. They are discussed in the following sections under the high-level themes from objective 2 and summarized in Table 4.

Condition Complexity
It is unclear whether OCs are unsuitable for complex patient queries or whether workflows and procedures can be better organized and OC systems can be better designed to deal with them. Therefore, we recommend that (1) complex conditions are routed through traditional consultation methods (eg, in person and telephone) and (2) further research is conducted on how these types of conditions could be better handled via OCs to ensure that they benefit all patients.
Technology
On the basis of existing evidence, we recommend that OC developers (1) allow patients to fully describe their queries using unstructured free text rather than MCQs, (2) support patients in providing sufficient detail in their queries for their primary care provider to respond quickly and safely, (3) allow for two-way written communication between staff and patients, and (4) integrate their solutions with existing core clinical software systems.
Technology design also plays a role in mitigating some of the undesirable outcomes we identified from using OCs, including increasing workload and costs. Increased workload is particularly important as it can lead to a mismatch between patient demand and health care resources, which can in turn threaten patient safety if providers are unable to deal with OCs in an appropriate time frame. A way this could happen is through
Figure 2. Artificial intelligence opportunities.

increased demand--if there are too many OCs submitted by patients and not enough staff to deal with them [55]. Whether this additional demand is a supply-induced [108] or previously unmet (and now unmasked) need was unclear from the studies we included [15] and requires further research. Nevertheless, OC systems could help by (1) supporting patients to self-care or signposting them to other services when appropriate; (2) matching capacity to demand by limiting the number of OC queries that primary care providers can receive from patients; (3) supporting workflow, for example, by determining whether OCs require clinical input to relieve the workload of administrators [86]; (4) assisting in triaging patient queries to reduce the associated costs of solely relying on clinicians for triage [22]; and (5) highlighting when patients may require an in-person appointment to facilitate direct booking to avoid work duplication [23], which may relate to patient query complexity.
According to our definition [82], many of these functions may require AI to be most effective, which should be explored by OC designers (Figure 2). In all, 54% (13/24) of MCQ-based OC systems in our review used AI (Table 1) [54], although largely for other functions rather than the aforementioned ones. Furthermore, AI was usually not the focus of the studies, and we consequently found only low-confidence evidence regarding its use in OCs (Multimedia Appendix 8). Therefore, how AI could be used by OC systems in clinical practice requires further research.

Darley et al

The included papers did not always adequately describe the OC systems studied, limiting our ability to determine how their specific features affected care quality. Future research should describe OC systems in detail so that evaluation findings can be usefully compared, for example, by using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist [110].
Adopters
We found inadequate exploration of participant (especially patient) experiences to confidently explain how and why the impacts on care equity arose during OC use. Study authors and health care staff often speculated reasons [18], but this was insufficient to formulate evidence-based hypotheses. Future research should explore the perspectives of patients using (and not using) OCs from a wide range of backgrounds using in-depth qualitative techniques such as interview-based methods. Patients from a variety of backgrounds should be involved in how OC systems are designed and help plan how they are implemented in practice.
Staff and patients resisted adopting OCs when they viewed traditional in-person consultation methods as the gold standard. Although this was understandable for complex queries [17], it was unclear whether other factors also influenced this view. Future research should address this evidence gap, particularly as COVID-19 has made remote consultations more commonplace [49]. In the meantime, this perception could be challenged by explaining the benefits of OCs found in our review to prospective users [111].
Organization
For patients and staff to experience the benefits of OCs, they must be widely promoted to patients as a route for them to contact their primary care provider. This can happen through various channels, such as mail-out campaigns (eg, via SMS text message) or by verbally mentioning OCs when in contact with patients (eg, when receptionists speak to patients on the telephone).
To minimize workload associated with OCs, we recommend that organizations (1) allocate sufficient resources to both setting up and processing them, including the provision of training on how to use OCs, and to staff and facilities (eg, computers and rooms) to deal with them; (2) divert as much incoming patient demand as possible through the system to avoid duplication and increase the proportion of patient contacts that benefit from OCs; and (3) incorporate OCs into daily work patterns by scheduling protected time for staff to deal with them to ensure

that they do not become additional tasks to complete on top of their normal work.
Our findings show that providers can increase access and patient satisfaction by responding quickly to OCs, although the definitions of what this involved were unclear. We recommend providing an initial response to patients' OC queries as soon as possible on the same day--either through written message or telephone call. This does not mean that the entire query needs to be resolved at this point, only that initial contact has been made and the query has been acknowledged.
We included studies from 9 countries, all of which were high-income Western countries. Owing to their remote nature, OCs may play a role in middle-income countries where there are isolated communities and fewer health care staff per head of population. However, further research is required to understand how their technological and financial barriers could be overcome.
Wider System
Governmental policies to promote OCs are effective in increasing adoption, although centralized funding is needed to sustain their use. It is unclear what the long-term experience of such policies is from the papers we included, particularly in response to those relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conclusions
This is the first theoretically informed synthesis of empirical research on OCs in primary care and uniquely includes studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. It contributes new knowledge that OCs are safe and have positive impacts on care quality, including increased access to primary care and decreased patient costs. However, they are also complex and often produce conflicting impacts on provider costs, staff and patient workloads, patient satisfaction, and care equity. Some of these are unintended and conflict with the promotion of OCs by policy makers as a way to address already increasing workload and decreasing workforce capacity in primary care [31-36]. Unlike previous evidence syntheses on the topic, we have shown that negative impacts on care quality of OCs can be mitigated through appropriate system design (eg, free text formats and two-way written communication), incorporation of advanced technologies (eg, AI), and integration into technical infrastructure (eg, EHRs) and organizational workflows (eg, timely responses). Since the advent of COVID-19, OCs have become indispensable, although further engineering and implementation research is required to realize their full benefits.

Abstract
Background: In the post-COVID-19 pandemic era, many countries have launched apps to trace contacts of COVID-19 infections. Each contact-tracing app (CTA) faces a variety of issues owing to different national policies or technologies for tracing contacts.
Objective: In this study, we aimed to investigate all the CTAs used to trace contacts in various countries worldwide, including the technology used by each CTA, the availability of knowledge about the CTA from official websites, the interoperability of CTAs in various countries, and the infection detection rates and policies of the specific country that launched the CTA, and to summarize the current problems of the apps based on the information collected.
Methods: We investigated CTAs launched in all countries through Google, Google Scholar, and PubMed. We experimented with all apps that could be installed and compiled information about apps that could not be installed or used by consulting official websites and previous literature. We compared the information collected by us on CTAs with relevant previous literature to understand and analyze the data.
Results: After screening 166 COVID-19 apps developed in 197 countries worldwide, we selected 98 (59%) apps from 95 (48.2%) countries, of which 63 (66.3%) apps were usable. The methods of contact tracing are divided into 3 main categories: Bluetooth, geolocation, and QR codes. At the technical level, CTAs face 3 major problems. First, the distance and time for Bluetooth- and geolocation-based CTAs to record contact are generally set to 2 meters and 15 minutes; however, this distance should be lengthened, and the time should be shortened for more infectious variants. Second, Bluetooth- or geolocation-based CTAs also face the problem of lack of accuracy. For example, individuals in 2 adjacent vehicles during traffic jams may be at a distance of 2 meters to make the CTA trace contact, but the 2 users may actually be separated by car doors, which could prevent transmission and infection. In addition, we investigated infection detection rates in 33 countries, 16 (48.5%) of which had significantly low infection detection rates, wherein CTAs could have lacked effectiveness in reducing virus propagation. Regarding policy, CTAs in most countries can only be used in their own countries and lack interoperability among other countries. In addition, 7 countries have already discontinued CTAs, but we believe that it was too early to discontinue them. Regarding user acceptance, 28.6% (28/98) of CTAs had no official source of information that could reduce user acceptance.
Conclusions: We surveyed all CTAs worldwide, identified their technological policy and acceptance issues, and provided solutions for each of the issues we identified. This study aimed to provide useful guidance and suggestions for updating the existing CTAs and the subsequent development of new CTAs.

KEYWORDS COVID-19; contact-tracing app; digital contact tracing; mobile phone

Introduction
Background
COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019 [1,2]. In previous research, the mean reproductive number of COVID-19 was 3.28, which was higher than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome [3]. COVID-19 has a relatively high reproductive number and an initial estimated case fatality rate of 5.6% [4]. As of May 2022, a total of 525 million cases have been confirmed by government agencies worldwide, and more than 6.2 million deaths have been reported [5]. In addition, COVID-19 has considerably affected various service sectors such as tourism [6].
Transmission of COVID-19 is mainly because of airborne transmission of the virus; thus, surface disinfectants, hand hygiene, wearing a mask, ventilation, maintaining social distance, and rapid tracing and notification of potentially infected persons are crucial to prevent infection spread [7,8]. Contact tracing, followed by the prompt isolation of close contacts of an infected individual, is another strategy for preventing virus propagation. Therefore, for tracing infected persons, many countries have launched several digital contact tracing (DCT) methods to supplement manual contact tracing (MCT) [9]. As mobile phones are indispensable in today's society, several nations have implemented mobile phone-based contact-tracing apps (CTAs) to alert people who have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2. Currently, despite widespread vaccination in some countries, many parts of the world remain unvaccinated. Even in highly vaccinated countries, COVID-19 continues to cause increased mortality and high levels of infections every 3 to 6 months. The widespread and effective use of CTAs may allow most people to return to their jobs, social events, and family life in capacities similar to those before the pandemic, implying less future morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. In addition, for diseases other than COVID-19 that are transmitted through close contact in the current (eg, monkeypox, Ebola, and COVID-19) and potential future outbreaks, CTA can be used to trace contacts. For example, CTAs have already been used to trace Ebola worldwide, serving as a precedent for mobile phone apps being used to trace contacts for diseases other than COVID-19.
Moreover, because some CTAs register personal information and collect user location data, the protection of personal privacy is an important issue facing CTAs. People worldwide have different attitudes regarding whether governments should protect personal privacy. A study showed that only 6% of people in the United States were very confident, and 25% were somewhat confident that the US government protected data privacy [10]. By contrast, a survey showed that in 2021, a total of 91% of Chinese respondents said that they trusted the Chinese government, the highest rate among the 28 countries surveyed, with a global average of only 52% of respondents saying that they trusted their governments [11]. Another study showed that 37.6% of the Chinese respondents investigated lacked privacy

trust in the government [12]. In general, Chinese people have far more trust in their government's ability to protect their privacy than people in the United States do. This trust may lead to a higher acceptance of CTAs in China than in the United States. Additionally, people in countries with lower economic living standards tend to have lower web-based concerns about private personal information than those living in low-income countries [13]. Differences in people's privacy concerns and trust in the ability of governments to protect privacy in different countries can lead to large differences in the acceptance of CTAs.
Literature Review
Previous studies have assessed the effectiveness of CTAs in single countries, including Finland, Switzerland, and Australia [14-16]. Since our study was an international study, it was extremely difficult to assess the effectiveness of all CTAs using the same research method. Therefore, this study focuses on identifying the theoretical and technical issues that may affect the effectiveness of CTAs and offers suggestions for addressing them. A previous study showed that different countries have different data protection policies that prevent most CTAs from being used in other countries like they are used in their own country [17]. However, this study did not mention the extent of interoperability of CTAs or list specific interoperable CTAs. Previous studies in Europe, New Zealand, and Japan have investigated the public acceptance of CTAs and the factors that influence public acceptance using questionnaires [18-20]. Therefore, this study clarifies which CTAs have issues that may affect their public acceptance. Several previous studies have investigated dozens of CTAs. A study selected CTAs from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, summarized the technology used in the CTAs, and analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of each technology (Bluetooth, GPS, and Wi-Fi) [21]. Another study categorized CTAs by underlying technology and investigated the number of CTA installations and the privacy design and public acceptance [22]. A third study analyzed the different technologies for implementing contact tracing using centralized, decentralized, and hybrid protocols and analyzed privacy issues at the technical level [23]. In addition, several previous studies have compared CTAs around the world [24-26]. However, no study has exhaustively investigated every CTA worldwide or the respective technologies used. CTAs in different countries or continents have various shortcomings, owing to differences in regional characteristics and national policies and the use of different technologies. In contrast to studies that have investigated several CTAs, this study investigated nearly every available CTA and identified common issues across CTAs.
Study Aims
In this study, we aimed to survey all the CTAs launched in the 197 countries recognized by the United Nations. To the best of our knowledge, this study has investigated the largest number of CTAs and countries to date; we have also categorized and evaluated the features and functions of each CTA by practically using of each CTA, read the description of each CTA, and

combined this information with findings from previous research to summarize the known problems and challenges of the CTAs in terms of technical issues, effectiveness, user acceptance, policies, and privacy and given possible solutions for each of these issues. We aimed to provide information for future CTA development and make recommendations for improving CTAs. Governments, health authorities, and technical teams in countries that have already launched CTAs may update and improve the CTAs by following our recommendations, such as extending the tracing distance of Bluetooth-based CTAs and enhancing the cross-border interoperability of CTAs. Countries that have not yet launched CTAs may design them based on the findings of our research.
Methods
Overview
The methodology was divided into 2 parts: data collection and data analysis. The data collected in this study included the countries that launched their own CTAs, basic information about these CTAs, and the detection rates of COVID-19 in these countries. For data analysis, we used a literature study to compare our collected data with the results of previous studies;

we aimed to determine the problems associated with CTAs and ways to improve them.
CTA Data Collection Method
To determine the countries that developed COVID-19 apps and collect information on these apps initially, we used Google, Google Scholar, and PubMed to search the keywords of the "country names" of the 197 countries recognized by the United Nations and "COVID-19 contact tracing app," "digital contact tracing," "COVID-19 app," and "mobile applications" in combination. We searched the databases from December 9, 2019 (when COVID-19 was officially confirmed), to March 15, 2022. Only the first 5 pages of the search results were considered because information on the pages thereafter was not relevant to this research. After searching a combination of country names and keywords, we identified the following 3 inclusion criteria based on which the country that was searched for launched its own app. All COVID-19 apps that could be installed during initial data collection were installed and used on the Android system (Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra) and iOS system (iPhone 11 Pro Max) mobile phones of the first author LMX. The initial collection of COVID-19 apps followed the exclusion criteria for secondary screening. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Textbox 1.

Textbox 1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for contact-tracing apps (CTAs); search keywords: "country names," "COVID-19 contact tracing app," "digital contact tracing," "COVID-19 app," and "mobile apps."

Inclusion criteria
· Google search results contained information from the government or the health department of the respective country about the COVID-19 app, such as an official website developed by the government.
· Google Scholar and PubMed search results showed published literature indicating that the country launched its own COVID-19 apps.
· Google search results did not contain information from the government or the health department, but there were news reports regarding COVID-19 app use in the country. We searched names of the COVID-19 apps mentioned in news reports on Google, Google Scholar, and PubMed, and the search results satisfied the first 2 criteria.

Exclusion criteria
· The app could not be installed with contact-tracing functionality for practical use.
· The app could not be installed or used, but a description of the contact-tracing function of the app could be found on the official website or in literature.
· Apps that were not CTAs, such as the official app launched by Timor-Leste for COVID-19 education.
· Regions that were not among the 197 United Nations-recognized countries were excluded from the study (eg, the British Gibraltar region, despite launching its own CTA, was excluded from this study because the region is not a sovereign state).
· CTAs that were not available in all parts of a country (eg, nonnational CTAs launched by each state government in the United States such as HMushrif, which was only used to trace isolated people and required a bracelet in Oman, and Msafari, which could only trace users in public transportation in Kenya).

Information in languages other than English, Chinese, and Japanese from government and health departments was translated using Google Translate for reading and comprehension. News reports in languages other than English, Chinese, and Japanese were not included in this study during the Google search. Although using each app, it was found that some did not support English, Chinese, or Japanese; for example, many apps from South American countries only supported Spanish. The relevant words or sentences were translated through screenshots using the translation software, DeepL Translate (DeepL SE) and Google Translate.

In this study, information on all CTAs was collected after secondary screening through practical use, consulting official websites, and literature. This information included the technology used by each CTA, whether there was an official website containing information on CTAs, whether they had interoperability with CTAs in other countries, and the COVID-19 detection rate in the country that launched the CTA. The information was first collected through the practical use of the installed CTAs. Regarding CTAs that were installed but could not be used for various reasons (such as the absence of a mobile phone number in the country they were launched) and

those that could not be installed, relevant literature and information from the government or health departments was referred to supplement the information gathered by us on these CTAs. The information on CTAs may be outdated in previous literature; thus, even if our results are inconsistent with those of official government or health departments or previous literature, they can be used clinically.
Data Analysis Through Literature Study
In this research, the information obtained by the method described in the CTA Data Collection Method section was integrated with the findings of previous research and analyzed, and the problems and challenges of the investigated CTAs were summarized.
Results
Basic Information of CTAs
After searching keywords through Google, Google Scholar, and PubMed, 64.5 % (127/197) of the countries were found to have launched 166 COVID-19 apps. Excluding 34 nonnational apps, 9 of the remaining apps were not CTAs; 25 apps have been reported to have been used for contact tracing, but they could not be used practically or did not have sufficient evidence (official websites or research papers) regarding contact tracing. Finally, 98 apps developed by 95 countries with sufficient evidence of a contact-tracing function were identified (Multimedia Appendix 1 and Figure 1). China, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan each had 2 CTAs that were used for contact tracing. A flow diagram depicting the screening procedure is shown in Figure 2.
Among the 95 countries with CTAs, Asian countries had the highest number of CTAs (35/95, 36.8%), whereas Oceania and South America each had the lowest number of CTAs (6/95, 6.3%). Regarding the number of countries with CTAs as a percentage of all countries on a continent, Asia had the highest percentage (35/48, 72.9%), and Africa had the lowest (9/54, 16.7%). The number of CTAs that could be practically used on either Android or iOS systems was 63, accounting for 64.3% (63/98) of all the CTAs. In the remaining CTAs (37/98, 37.8%), the app could not be used because it could not be installed, requiring mobile phone number in a specific country or personal ID, or it could be installed but could not be opened or crashed after opening. After testing all the available CTAs and investigating the introductory information from official websites or previous literature for the nonavailable CTAs, we found that the technologies used for contact tracing could be divided into 3 main categories: Bluetooth, geolocation, and QR code. Bluetooth was the most widely used technology, used in 71 (72.4%) of the 98 CTAs; 35 (35.7%) CTAs used geolocation, and 21 (21.4%) used QR codes (Multimedia Appendix 1). Of the 98 CTAs included in this study, 45 (45.9%) required the

registration of personal information, 42 (42.8%) did not, and for 11 (11.2%) CTAs, this information was unknown. The personal information required most often included data such as name, mobile phone number, government identification number, date of birth, and address (Multimedia Appendix 1).
Regarding the interoperability of CTAs among different countries, 17 national CTAs could be operated in different countries. Table 1 shows specific information on the CTAs that had interoperability and the CTAs that could be operated. Of these, 16 were CTAs in EU countries; these CTAs are generally available and can be operated in >10 countries in the European Union. The only CTA other than the CTAs in EU countries that had interoperability was the careFIJI (CTA of Fiji), which can be used in New Zealand.
In addition to collecting information on CTAs, we investigated the estimated COVID-19 infection detection rate (percentage of positives detected to the number of true positives) based on the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model in countries with CTAs; the data were available for 33 countries (Table 2). The highest detection rate was observed in Iceland (52%), and the lowest was observed in Myanmar, Pakistan, Niger, Uganda, and Bangladesh (close to 0%).
Detection rate means percentage of positives detected to the number of true positives. Of the 98 CTAs, 85 (87%) had official websites created by their respective governments, health departments, or developers (Multimedia Appendix 2). In the CTA information available in Multimedia Appendix 2, yes indicates that the official website includes a CTA guide, functions of the CTA, and other CTA-related information, with a total of 70 CTAs; no indicates CTAs with official websites, but without any introduction in official websites, with a total of 15 CTAs; unknown indicates CTAs without official websites, with a total of 13 CTAs. Investigating the download number data for 2022 for each CTA was difficult; only the 2020 download data were available for most CTAs. Of the countries for which download number data were available for 2022, WeChat (a Chinese CTA) had the highest percentage of downloads to the total population at approximately 88.8% (1.28 billion/1.45 billion). The reasons for this high percentage are as follows. (1) WeChat is not only a CTA but also a national chat app in China. (2) In China, it is impossible to enter large public places and move across provinces without the health codes contained in the app. Downloads as a percentage of the total population were, in descending order, Corona-Warn-App (45,820,000/84,324,494, 54.3%; Germany), NHS COVID-19 (31,044,213/68,605,590, 45.3%; United Kingdom), CoronaMelder (5,864,547/17,211,368, 34.1%; the Netherlands), COCOA (37,340,000/125,695,455, 29.7%; Japan), Koronavilkku (1,311,220/5,506,784, 23.8%; Finland), Radar COVID (8,568,514/46,791,314, 18.3%; Spain), and Aarogya Setu (216,800,000/1,407,993,700, 15.4%; India).

Discussion
Principal Findings
The principle of Bluetooth-based CTAs for contact tracing is that when 2 users with smartphones come into proximity, the CTA records the contact, and the contact record is retained for a certain number of days depending on the presettings of the CTA, usually 14 or 21 days. During this period, if one of the users tests positive for COVID-19, the user will either voluntarily or compulsorily be registered as positive in the CTA. The user who was in close contact with the COVID-19 positive

user will be sent an alert notification on their smartphone. The protocols developed based on Bluetooth technology include BlueTrace, DP-3T, Google or Apple Exposure Notification, Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing, and OpenCovidTrace [9], which differ in the centralization or decentralization in data collection.
Governments can develop their own CTAs based on any of these protocols and determine the specific time and distance for which that proximity will be recorded for the respective CTAs. In this study, 71 CTAs using Bluetooth to record the specific time and distance of contact were investigated; the time and

distance data were available for 21 (29.6%) CTAs (Table 3). The shortest contact distance recorded was 1 meter for COCOA (CTA of Japan) and the longest contact distance recorded was 5 meters for Self Safety (CTA of Uzbekistan; Figure 3). The shortest contact time recorded was 1 minute for Self Safety and COVIDSafe (CTA of Australia) and the longest contact time recorded was 20 minutes for VirusRadar (CTA of Hungary). Of the 21 CTAs, 11 (52.4%) set the recorded contact time and distance at 2 meters and 15 minutes. In addition, some countries' CTAs, such as HaMagen (CTA of Israel), use Wi-Fi-assisted Bluetooth technology for contact tracing.
It should be noted that in Android systems, CTAs using the Google or Apple Exposure Notification protocol request permission to obtain a user's geolocation but do not use geolocation for contact tracing.
Geolocation-based CTAs trace contact in the following 2 ways. (1) Geolocation records the proximity between mobile phone users and alerts those who have contacted a user who tested

positive for COVID-19 and was registered in the CTA, similar to Bluetooth contact tracing. Some CTAs such as Mor Chana (CTA of Thailand) and Aarogya Setu (CTA of India) trace the proximity of contact between 2 users through a combination of GPS and Bluetooth data. This approach can be centralized or decentralized for data collection. (2) WeChat and Alipay (CTAs of China) record the user's geographic location via a cell tower, and the user's health code turns red when an infection outbreak occurs in a city or region that the user visited in the past 14 days. This approach is typically centralized for data collection.
The principle of CTAs using QR codes to trace contacts is as follows: when a user wants to enter a public place (eg, supermarket, restaurant, or movie theater), the user will either volunteer or be instructed to scan the QR code set up in the public place to record check in and if the user tests positive for COVID-19, the public place that they visited will be classified as a high-risk area. Other users who visited the same area will be notified through an alarm or a red health code in their CTAs (Figure 4).

Comparison With Prior Work
Regarding contact-tracing distance and effectiveness, the criteria for the time and distance of proximity set by Bluetooth-based CTAs vary among countries. Regarding the safe social distance for preventing the spread of COVID-19, previous research has shown that 1.6 to 3.0 meters is a safe social distance for the airborne transmission of large droplets exhaled during speech, whereas the distance can reach 8.2 meters if all droplets are

considered; furthermore, a social distance of 2 meters is not effective in preventing the spread of infection. [8,29]. Moreover, infectivity varies among different variants of viruses; earlier viruses are usually considered to be the least infectious, while the Alpha variants are considered to be 50% more infectious than the earlier strains, and the Delta variants are considered to be 60% more infectious than the Alpha variants [30]. By contrast, the Omicron variant, recognized by the World Health Organization on November 26, 2021, is considered to be the

most infectious variant to date and is >10 times more infectious than earlier strains or 2.8 times more infectious than the Delta variants [31]. Omicron variant transmission was simulated by a Japanese research team in February 2022 using the supercomputer Fugaku. The results showed that while talking without a mask for 15 minutes, the maximum and average rates of infection were approximately 50% and 25%, respectively, for a distance of 2 meters between 2 people, and the rates of maximum and average rates of infection dropped to approximately 10% and 5%, respectively, when the distance was increased to 3 meters [32]. The study also simulated the infection rate of 2 people talking at different times, and the results showed that at a distance of 1 meter, 2 people talking without masks for 15 minutes showed a maximum infection rate of 95% and an average infection rate of 60%; for 6 minutes, they showed a maximum infection rate of 70% and an average infection rate of 30%; for 3 minutes, their maximum and average rates of infection dropped to 30% and 10%, respectively. Therefore, to maintain the infection rate of the Omicron variant at <10%, the tracing distance and time should be set to 1 meter and 3 minutes or 3 meters and 15 minutes. Among the 21 CTAs in Table 3, 14 (66.7%) had a tracing time of 15 minutes and 13 (92.8%) of these had a tracing distance of 2 meters. The contact-tracing distance and time settings for these CTAs were 2 meters and 15 minutes, as per the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control guidelines [33]. However, with the drastic reduction in face mask use in some countries, more infectious variants may be transmitted to others at a tracing distance and time much greater than 2 meters and much lesser than 15 minutes, respectively. Thus, current Bluetooth-based CTAs may not be able to trace many potentially infected individuals, because it may have tracing ranges that are too short to identify possible contact and spread. Importantly, in most countries, users who receive a CTA exposure notification are not mandated to quarantine or to undergo polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Instead, with longer tracing distances and shorter tracing times, users can prepare for possible infections after receiving the exposure notification; for example, preparing food and sanitary products before the infection leads to fever and weakness. Thus, setting longer tracing distances and shorter tracing times for CTAs should be preferred.
Bluetooth- and geolocation-based contact tracing face many real-life problems that lead to decreased accuracy or false positives. For instance, in a public toilet, although 2 users with CTAs may be at a distance of 2 meters, making the CTAs trace contact, the 2 users may actually be separated by a thin wall or two, which could prevent infection [34]. Individuals in 2 adjacent vehicles may face a similar situation during traffic jams (Figure 5). In addition, signal absorption by the human body (when the mobile phone is in the pocket); interference of Wi-Fi signals; and absorption, interference, and diffraction caused by obstacles made of different materials in the signal propagation path can decrease the accuracy of Bluetooth tracing [35-37]. Moreover, different CTA detection rules in railways may lead to a 50% false-alarm rate [37]. Some countries have developed various countermeasures to cope with situations that may lead to decreased accuracy in CTAs. For example, the CTA in Singapore records contacts at a distance of 10 meters; therefore, there will often be signals being transmitted through walls,
https://publichealth.jmir.org/2022/10/e40233

ceilings, and floors. In response, TraceTogether (CTA of Singapore) uploads contact-tracing data to the Ministry of Health, which processes and filters them based on their duration and signal strength to identify only close contacts [38]. HaMagen requests access to body movement data during initial use to avoid false alarm situations when individuals are separated by 2 adjacent vehicles during traffic jams. NOVID, developed at Carnegie Mellon University, uses a combination of ultrasound and Bluetooth. It is the only CTA that uses ultrasound to measure the distance for contact tracing. The NOVID research team experimentally found that at distances<1.82 meter, 103 out of 187 total experimental samples were correctly identified with an accuracy rate of 55.1%, whereas at distances >12 feet, 225 experimental samples were correctly identified 224 times, with an accuracy rate of 99.6%. Moreover, in real life, the tracing accuracy for a distance of <6 feet would be significantly >55.1% [39]. In addition, the ultrasonic method used by NOVID is effective in excluding false positives even in the presence of obstacles [39]. Therefore, ultrasonic technology has great potential for improving the accuracy of CTAs in contact tracing, particularly at long distances and in the presence of obstacles.
The detection rate of COVID-19 is one of the key factors affecting the effectiveness of CTAs. Low detection rates reduce the effectiveness of CTAs because contact tracing is impossible without a confirmed diagnosis, which is a serious challenge for both DCT and MCT. Previous research has shown that contact tracing barely reduces viral propagation when the detection rate is only 13%, and the effectiveness of contact tracing increases significantly when the detection rate increases to 26% or 37% [40]. In June 2020, the average detection rate worldwide was <10% and varied significantly among countries [41]. Therefore, the use of CTAs may not be effective in reducing viral propagation in most countries. Table 2 shows the data for the 33 countries that have developed CTAs wherein detection rates are available [42]. Even in the latter half of 2021 and 2022, only 11 (33.3%) of the 33 countries showed detection rates of >26%, and 3 (9.1%) countries showed detection rates of >37%. There are 16 (48.5%) countries that have not yet reached a detection rate of 13%; in these countries, CTAs can have an extremely limited effect. Currently, PCR testing is free and routine in some countries such as China and Japan. However, the cost of PCR testing varies greatly depending on factors such as the type of laboratory, country or region, and insurance provider [43]. Previous studies have shown that the cost of PCR testing, cost of commuting to a testing site, and time required for PCR testing can make it difficult for people who are willing to be tested [44,45]. Moreover, the convenience and comfort of the sample extraction method affected the willingness to test [45]. In many countries, PCR testing is expensive and difficult to access. This lack of access may lead to CTAs not being able to effectively trace potential infections and eventual getting discontinued. Therefore, making PCR testing free and routine may increase the willingness of users to undergo the test and improve the effectiveness of CTAs. In China, the following methods were used to increase the testing rates. Nationals who did not have a PCR testing certificate within the last 72 hours were not allowed to enter public places such as shopping malls, movie theaters, and public bathrooms and were not allowed to move across

provinces by any means of transportation. To reduce costs and improve efficiency, China used a 10-in-1 or 20-in-1 mixed sample, in which samples from 10 or 20 people were tested together in a single sampling tube [46,47]. If the result was negative, it was assumed that all 10 or 20 participants were negative. If the test result was positive, the staff immediately individually isolated 10 or 20 samples in that mixed tube for a

temporary period and recollected separate single-tube samples for testing. Furthermore, oropharyngeal swabs were used for routine testing in China and were less painful and more widely accepted than nasopharyngeal swabs [46,47]. These methods have allowed China to maintain a 42% detection rate based on the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model even with a large population of 1.4 billion.

Figure 5. False tracing may happen in 2 adjacent vehicles during traffic jams.

According to our results, of the 197 sovereign countries around the world, 95 (48.2%) have developed 98 apps for contact tracing. However, different countries have different data protection policies that prevent most CTAs from being used in other countries as they are used in their own countries [17]. The CTA interoperability system, which was launched in October 2020 within the European Union, was the first CTA system to remove national operational barriers. The first countries to join this system were Germany, Italy, and Ireland [48]. We investigated CTAs that can be used in other countries as of May 2022; currently, only 17 CTAs can be used in other countries, 16 (94.1%) of which are in the European Union (Table 1). However, with the increasing liberalization of border measures of each country and international travel, the current interoperability of CTAs among countries other than those from Europe does not meet the status quo. International travelers may come into close contact with patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in other countries while traveling on international flights and while traveling in their destination country. However, because CTAs are not interoperable, travelers may not be able to detect transmission or infection resulting from close contact. Since the novel coronavirus has an incubation period of days to weeks, travelers may mistakenly believe that they are not infected until they have significant symptoms. Thus, tourists may spend time in public places for sightseeing, unaware that they have been infected. In this case, if tourists do not restrict their activities in public places, the virus may be further transmitted to more people. Increasing the interoperability of CTAs and removing national barriers among different countries is an important method to avoid cross-country transmission of COVID-19.
CTA policy is no longer stringent. With the increasing number of vaccinations, high asymptomatic rates, and low mortality presented by the Omicron variant compared with initial strains [49], many countries are easing their COVID-19 protection policies, with a trend of relaxation in rules regarding CTAs. For example, according to official information, the QR code-based

"check-in" function was abolished in the United Kingdom from February 24, 2022 [50]. Meanwhile, we found through practical use, the QR code scanning function of the previous version of the NHS COVID-19 app (CTA of the United Kingdom) was removed. Moreover, Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Finland, and Canada have discontinued their CTAs. This implies that CTAs no longer support contact tracing or notifications. However, we believe that this was a premature discontinuation of CTAs because of the following reasons. First, a study in South Africa investigated the asymptomatic rate of different variant infections in 577 health care patients who received a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (2.6% for Beta and Delta and 16% for Omicron variants) [49], and another meta-analysis showed an asymptomatic rate of 40% for those infected with the Omicron virus [51]. According to the data, even with vaccination, more than half of the patients infected with Omicron developed symptoms. Therefore, as stated earlier in this section, users who receive notifications of exposure through CTAs can be well prepared for the possibility of symptoms. Especially in countries where medical resources are scarce, users can contact their physicians and reserve hospital beds earlier. Second, in the 2 years since the launch of CTAs, many countries have shown large CTA-using populations. Among the CTAs of countries that have discontinued CTAs, eRouska (CTA of the Czech Republic) has 1.7 million users, reaching 15.9% of the total population [52], and discontinuing CTAs may cause widespread uninstallation of the app. However, it is not possible to predict whether a more infectious variant of COVID-19 with a higher mortality rate or other new infectious diseases will emerge in future; the increase in the number of CTA-installed users is a slow process that may miss the best time for contact tracing. The official website of Smittestopp (CTA of Norway) shows that people in Norway no longer need to register COVID-19 positivity on their CTA. However, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health still supports the CTA and suggests that people keep Smittestopp on their mobile phones in case infection rates start to rise again [53].

We believe that even if the COVID-19 outbreak is contained, it is better to advise people to leave CTAs on their phones, as Norway has done, rather than to uninstall them.
Regarding user acceptance, a study based on a large-scale web-based survey in Japan showed an increase in the level of knowledge related to COCOA (CTA in Japan) to be associated with acceptance of the CTA. Therefore, sufficient knowledge about CTAs, such as the technology of the CTAs for contact tracing, privacy policy, and data storage time, can be effective in encouraging their use among people [20]. Official websites containing information on CTAs are one of the main sources of information for understanding CTAs. In this study, 98 official websites of CTAs were investigated, of which 70 (71.4%) had detailed information, and among the 28 CTAs that lacked sufficient information, 15 (53.6%) had official websites without relevant information, and 13 (46.4%) did not have official websites (Multimedia Appendix 2). Creating understandable information sources for CTAs has great potential for increasing their acceptance among users.
Multimedia Appendix 1 lists the 98 CTAs that required personal information to be entered at the time of registration. Compared with other continents, CTAs in Europe generally do not require personal information or require only a small amount of personal information. Of the 28 CTAs in Europe, only the United Kingdom and Ireland require personal information to be entered at the time of registration. It is important to note that the NHS COVID-19 CTA (CTA of the United Kingdom) requires information about the postal code and region of address, and the COVID TRACKER (CTA of Ireland) requires the selection of whether the person is aged >16 years. In contrast to CTAs that require detailed personal information, CTAs in the United Kingdom and Ireland do not require a user's name, exact

address, mobile phone number, or any other detailed information. By contrast, 25 (65.8%) of the 38 CTAs in Asia require personal information; most of which require detailed information such as name and mobile phone number. CTAs that do not require personal information have a lower risk of violating privacy than those that require detailed information. However, as nationals from different countries have different levels of trust in their governments and previous literature shows that people in countries with lower economic living standards are less concerned about the privacy of personal information than people in developed countries [13], nationals of different countries may be differently receptive to CTAs that require personal information. In addition, at the technical level, CTAs based on decentralized Bluetooth technology do not require the user's location data and thus are most likely to protect the user's location data. By contrast, location-based CTAs access the user's location data and thus know where the user is in real time. With QR code-based CTAs, the user's location is not known when the user does not enter a public place; however, once the user enters a public place, the CTA records "check-ins" at specific locations. Therefore, location-based CTAs and QR code-based CTAs carry the risk of violating users' location privacy. Figure 6 classifies CTAs by technology and by whether personal information is required, indicating the risk of possible privacy violations. CTAs that use decentralized Bluetooth technology and do not require any personal information have the lowest risk of violating user privacy. Most European CTAs are classified under this category. CTAs that use both location and QR code technologies and require detailed personal information have the highest risk of privacy violation. CTAs in China, Thailand, Brunei, Malaysia, and Indonesia were classified in this category.

Limitations
We summarized the contact-tracing techniques used in 98 CTAs through practical use and through information on official websites and previous literature. The CTAs we used were the latest versions that could be downloaded; thus, our information on contact-tracing techniques was also up-to-date and reliable. However, after collecting information on the CTAs that could not be used practically through information on official websites and previous literature, we found that some information, especially in the literature, was more than a year old; this information could be inconsistent with the latest version of the CTA. The CTAs marked with letter a in the upper right corner in Multimedia Appendix 1 are those that cannot be used, and the sources of information about these CTAs can be found in Multimedia Appendix 3.
In addition, we used Google Translate and DeepL Translate to understand the content of the literature in languages other than Chinese, English, and Japanese and of CTAs that do not support Chinese, English, or Japanese. Google Translate and DeepL Translate were not always accurate. However, the literature in languages other than Chinese, English, and Japanese and the CTAs in these other languages only account for a very small portion of this study, so they do not have a significant impact on the study. In future studies, we invite researchers who can read other languages to help us.
Conclusions
For airborne infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, contact tracing is important to reduce viral propagation, and mobile app-based DCT is an effective tool to assist MCT. In this study, we investigated CTAs worldwide; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate nearly all CTAs worldwide. We combined the results of this study with those of previous studies to identify common issues in the technology, policy, and user acceptance of CTAs. Most of the current Bluetooth-based CTAs have set the distance and time of tracing contact at 2 meters and 15 minutes; however, considering that several viral variants have stronger infectivity than the initial strains, 2 meters and 15 minutes is not sufficient. Contact-tracing distance and time set at 3 meters and 15 minutes or 1 meter and 3 minutes is preferred. Although some low-income countries with low infection detection rates have launched their own CTAs, the CTAs may not be effective in reducing viral

propagation. Currently, only the European Union has developed an interoperable system that allows CTAs to be used in other countries, and outside the European Union, only careFIJI (CTA of Fiji) can be used in New Zealand. Other countries' CTAs do not have interoperability among different countries. Removing CTAs' national barriers and increasing interoperability worldwide are critical because countries are gradually opening their borders, and COVID-19 policies are being implemented less strictly. Creating official websites that include information on CTAs would increase their user acceptance and promote installation; 28 (28.6%) of 98 CTAs lacked access to comprehensive and reliable CTA information through official websites. We examined several practical situations that may affect the accuracy of GPS location; 3 CTAs were found to address this lack of accuracy. Among these, the ultrasonic technology used by NOVID was effective in improving the accuracy of the CTA after several rounds of experiments. We found that CTAs have been discontinued in 5 countries since February 2022. We believe that this was a premature discontinuation because COVID-19 has not been eliminated, and it is not possible to predict whether new variants will emerge in the future.
In addition, vaccination has been shown to reduce infection rates, alleviate infection symptoms, and reduce case fatality rates. Therefore, we believe that in countries with widespread vaccination, users do not need extremely stringent measures such as mandatory hospitalization or 14-day self-isolation after receiving notifications of CTA exposure. Overresponse to CTA exposure notifications disrupts both the daily lives of users and the national economy. However, we believe that the greatest benefit of CTAs is that users who receive exposure notifications can prepare for possible infections in advance. For example, users who receive exposure notifications can wear masks to avoid spreading the virus to more people, cancel unnecessary plans to visit public places, make appointments for PCR testing, and prepare medicines in advance to deal with fever and debilitation after infection. Currently, most countries do not mandate that nationals respond upon receiving CTA exposure notification, but the government or health departments should provide guidelines and suggestions on measures to be taken by users who receive an exposure notification. We created a recommendation list for future CTA updates and designs as well as for policy development (Textbox 2).

Abstract
Background
Social media addiction, a recently emerged term in medical science, has attracted the attention of researchers because of its significant physical and psychological effects on its users. The issue has attracted more attention during the COVID era because negative emotions (e.g., anxiety and fear) generated from the COVID pandemic may have increased social media addiction. Therefore, the present study investigates the role of negative emotions and social media addiction (SMA) on health problems during and after the COVID lockdown.
Methods
A survey was conducted with 2926 participants aged between 25 and 45 years from all eight divisions of Bangladesh. The data collection period was between 2nd September- 13th October, 2020. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was conducted for data analysis by controlling the respondents' working time, leisure time, gender, education, and age.
Results
Our study showed that social media addiction and time spent on social media impact health. Interestingly, while anxiety about COVID increased social media addition, fear about COIVD reduced social media addition. Among all considered factors, long working hours

contributed most to people's health issues, and its impact on social media addiction and hours was much higher than negative emotions. Furthermore, females were less addicted to social media and faced less health challenges than males.
Conclusion
The impacts of negative emotions generated by the COVID disaster on social media addiction and health issues should be reconsidered. Government and employers control people's working time, and stress should be a priority to solve people's social media addiction-related issues.

Introduction
Social media, being a fundamental part of people's lives, leaves an immense impact on every aspect. Scrolling and checking social media has become almost a daily routine of over half of the world's population's daily activities. According to statistics, in the last five years, the number of social media users has almost doubled, increasing from 2.2 billion in 2015 to 4.5 billion in 2022 [1]. This number of users is increasing at an incredible rate. In addition, according to data, there will be 52.58 million internet subscribers in Bangladesh in January 2022. At the beginning of 2022, Bangladesh's number of internet users was 31.5% population. According to Kepios, internet subscribers in Bangladesh rose by 5.5 million (+11.6%) between 2021 and 2022. At the beginning of 2022, 29.7% of Bangladesh's overall inhabitants used social media. Furthermore, according to data revealed in Meta's advertising materials, Facebook had 44.70 million subscribers in Bangladesh in January 2022. According to Google's commercial techniques, YouTube had 34.50 million subscribers in Bangladesh as of early 2022. As a result, it is pretty much evident that the usage of internet in Bangladesh is increasing on a regular basis [2]. The number is rising because social media is the only web-based platform where people with similar backgrounds, interests, activities, and connections can be linked [3]. Besides, the financial ability of people to buy social media (Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram etc.) accessible devices such as smartphones and laptops has increased, resulting in the increasing number of social media users [4]. As social media creates ample opportunities for people to correspond virtually, temporal and partial boundaries notwithstanding [5] and promotes communication and sharing of images and videos amongst social network users, individuals of all ages around the world are taking this advantage [6].
Moreover, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by Novel Corona Virus significantly influences every individual's lifestyle [7, 8]. Various governments are adopting policies such as lockdown, quarantine etc., to curb the spread of the virus by keeping people indoors [9]. Working from home and virtual education practices have forced people to spend a long time on social media in order to fulfil their needs for work- and disaster-related information, entertainment, and interpersonal communication [10]. Despite the fact that social media plays an undeniably beneficial role in sustaining contact and relationships among individuals, its increased usage is sufficient to result in addiction [11]. A past study has revealed that social media addiction depends on the daily time devoted to the social media platform, and more frequent daily visits increase addiction to social media profiles [12]. Another study found an important association between high school students' daily average internet usage time and social media addiction [13]. However, while social media usage may not always be harmful, some people get addicted and use it extremely or obsessively [14]. Experts have observed the harmful effects of long-term addiction and extreme and obsessive social media usage and

showed that such a level of social media addiction might result in psychological, physiological and productivity issues [15].
There is evidence that obsessive social media usage can impact users' psychological, cognitive, perceptual, and physiological wellbeing. Addicted social media users may have withdrawal feelings, relational issues and others as well [16]. Recent research has found that many people have become addicted to social media due to the COVID-19 epidemic [11], creating several physical health issues such as headaches, sleeping disorders, stomach ailments, and exhaustion [17, 18]. It has been found that using different online platforms, especially social media and shopping websites-whether for essential items or shopping items has increased a lot during COVID-19. This change in the excessive use of digital media has brought numerous physical disorders [19] and left adverse effects on the usual physical activities among the general population [20]. It has been established that despite social media being an essential and integral part of people's lives for day-to-day work and communication, the impact caused by its extensive use on health cannot be ignored [21].
Social media addiction may create significant emotional problems as well. Fear resulting from much information on social media regarding the coronavirus disease and the 'lockdown' situation caused high levels of uncertainty. It raised the level of stress, anxiety, and depression (sometimes leading to suicides) among people worldwide [22-24].
Social media usage hours are strongly correlated with creating social media addiction, and social media addiction causes several physical and psychological issues. Past studies from Bangladesh have assessed the effect of social media and smartphone use vis-à- COVID-19 (the virus). For instance, a study by Islam and colleagues [25] investigated complicated smartphone use, and complex social media use among College and University students in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings of that study indicated that problematic social media use was linked to poor psychological wellbeing (such as anxiety and depression) and other factors (particularly landowner age, and poor sleep) during the pandemic, which further suggested the demand for interventions included virtual awareness programmes among College and University students. The present study mainly focused on social media users' health and psychological problems among workers across all the nine districts of Bangladesh after the COVID-19 restriction period imposed by the government of Bangladesh. This study will inform future similar studies and the establishment of new policies seeking to find out how Bangladeshi workers might be affected by social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the study's results could assist efforts to disseminate behavioural health information on social media.
Reviewing the relevant literature established that social media addiction brings physical and psychological changes. Consequently, the present research focused on psychological and physical issues related to social media addiction. Based on the background of the study above, the following research hypotheses were propounded.
Conceptual framework
According to the background and objectives of the study and based on the research hypothesises, the researchers have identified the variables of the present study and showed their hypothesised relationship in Fig 1.
Hypotheses
Based on the research purposes, conceptual framework and the discussion above, the current study established the following research hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Anxiety is correlated with social media addiction.

Fig 1. Conceptual framework for the model (based on Brunborg and Burdzovic, 2019 [26]; Coyne et al., 2020 [27]). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274898.g001
The COVID-19 pandemic is an epidemiologic and health crisis since it causes extensive psychological issues such as stress, anxiety, depression, trauma, panic, insomnia, death distress, anger, psychosis, boredom, and suicide [28-32].
Hypothesis 2 (H2): Fear is correlated with social media addiction.
However, the pandemic has underscored the downside of social media by showing that uncontrolled use propagates panic, fear, and misinformation about COVID-19 among mass populations [33-35]. There has been a great fear of contracting the virus among many people worldwide bee of the worldwide rise in the death toll due to the virus [36]. Excessive social media use has been identified as one of the major reasons behind this rise in fear. Social media platforms have become home to atrocious and sometimes erroneous information associated with the virus [9]. Social media users spread rumours, conspiracy theories, and even inaccurate calculations of COVID-19 cases and deaths, propagating fear among the masses [33-35].
Hypothesis 3 (H3): Social media addiction is correlated with social media usage hours.
According to a past study [12], social media addiction has risen significantly, as has the amount spent online on a routine basis. The obsession is exacerbated by the more frequent daily visits to social media accounts.
Hypothesis 4 (H4): Social media addiction is correlated with physical health issues.
Past research has revealed that uncontrollable usage of social media affects physical and mental health, such as cardio-metabolic health, sleep, affect, self-esteem, wellbeing and functioning, particularly in adolescents [37].
Hypothesis 5 (H5): Social media usage hours are correlated with physical health issues.
It is evident, and this is inspired by research that 'internet addiction' is principally linked to increased social media or gaming activities [38].

Social media addiction and emotions--The moderating role of post-COVID timing
Hypothesis 6 (H6): Time plays a moderating role in the proposed relationships. Specifically, a) the relationship between anxiety and social media addiction will be more substantial over time; b) the relationship between fear and social media addiction will be more substantial over time; c) the relationship between social media addiction and social media usage hours will be more robust over time and d) the relationship between social media addiction and physical issues will be more potent over time, after the disaster.
Method Participants
This study embraced a sequential cross-sectional design. Data were collected for six weeks from 2nd September- 13Th of October, 2020. This period was chosen because of the sad change in people's lifestyle of being isolated from the outside world due to the pandemic and obtaining most of their necessities using a virtual medium. Furthermore, during this period, the situation was getting normal, participants resumed their work physically, and offices opened after the COVID-19 lockdown. Consequently, a new normal life was being experienced, and participants with technology, the internet, and social media became indispensable. This cross-sectional survey was conducted in all 8 divisions of the country in which, 2926 out of 3,500 yielding a response rate of about 84%.
Measures
A self-administered online survey was conducted using social media, in which 2926 out of 3,500 respondents correctly completed questionnaires. Anxiety and fear were determined by answering `yes' to the question "What kind of psychological problem do you feel for extensive use of the Internet" while Physical issues were those answered relating to neck pain, headaches, and numbness to the question "What kind of physical problem have you experienced from the extensive use of the Internet since COVID-19 lockdown?". Social media addiction was those that to the questions "Do you feel to urge use social media more and more?", "Do you become restless or feel troubled if unable to use social media?", "Do you spend a lot of time thinking about social media or planning to use social media?" and "Do you use social media so much that it could cause a negative impact on your job or studies?" and social media hours was determined by the responded to the question,"How many hours do you spend daily on using social media?".
The data were collected over six weeks, starting from week 1 (2nd-8th September); followed by week 2 (9th-15th September), week 3 (16th-22nd September), week 4 (23rd-29th September), week 5 (30th-6th October) and week 6 (7th -13th October) in that order. Variables considered in the data collection included: gender, age, education level, work time and leisure time. A structured questionnaire was used for that purpose. Each variable in the questionnaire was coded; for instance, for gender, the male was coded "1", the female was coded "2", and the other was coded "88". For the level of education, Under SSC, SSC or equivalent, HSC or equivalent, Graduate, Postgraduate, Doctorate, Post Doctorate and Other were coded "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6" and "7, respectively.
Ethics
The Institutional Review Board of the International University of Business, Agriculture and Technology (IUBAT), Dhaka, Bangladesh, granted permission for this study (IUBAT/AR/ 2021/002). The study followed the principles of the Helsinki Declaration, as updated in Fortaleza. Before completing the questionnaire, all participants were informed about the study's

specific goal. Data collected from the field was treated with high confidentiality, and prior to data collection, the participants were informed of the confidentiality of the information they provide. Verbal and written consent was obtained from all the participants, and the participants' confidentiality and privacy were maintained.
Respondents were permitted to complete the survey only once to avert repeated responses and to ensure that the data were valid to some extent. This was because data were limited to their IP addresses and device. Respondents had the option of terminating the survey at any time they desired. Furthermore, we ensured that the data were anonymous and confidential.

Statistical analysis
Smart PLS 3 was used to analyse this study through a Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) approach. There are several reasons for choosing this approach. These include its ability to deal with complex multivariate models and variables with different scales, explore theories, and test multiple mediators simultaneously [30]. We used the SmartPLS to have the individual parameters and the significance level [39]. In this study, the first step was to create groups according to the categorical variables of interest, including age, gender, education, working time and leisure time and this was followed by data analysis of the measurement reliability, validity for the latent reflective construct and social media addiction were examined by several indicators as suggested by Malak and colleagues [40]. Next, the second stage involved assessing the structural model correlations and hypotheses testing with significance levels. Model estimation was conducted with r2, Q2 and effect size describes the path effect from exogenous construct to endogenous construct [41]. Next, the path coefficients of the groups were analysed to determine if they were significantly diverse from each other based on the guidelines proposed by Henseler et al. [42]. To enable figures using latent constructs, a mean score of the four measurement items of social media addiction was created. Graphical representations using SPSS statistical software was used in order to further understand the interaction effects and the changes of the endogenous variables over time, and this was carried out by creating a mean score of the four measurement items of social media addiction and the variable were classified into five values, which are: 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75. 1.

Results
Two thousand nine hundred and twenty-six Bangladeshi respondents participated in this study, and the breakdown of their characteristics are shown in Table 1 where 60.7% respondents were male and 39.3% were female. Table 2 presents the hypothesis testing, path

coefficients and their corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs), and the result suggests that the proposed model is well suited for confirming and explaining the positive effect of anxiety on social media addiction, as suggested in H1. Fear was negatively associated with social media addiction ( = -0.12, t = 7.00, p<0.001). H3 showed that social media addiction has a positive and significant effect on social media hours ( = 0.22, t = 7.03, p<0.001), similarly, a H4 showed a significant positive effect of social media addiction on physical issues ( = 0.44, t = 20.37, p<0.001). H5 revealed social media hours were significantly and positively related to physical issues ( = 0.07, t = 3.23, p<0.001), and all hypothesis reported in Table 2 was supported except H2.
The path coefficient for the five hypotheses differs statistically except for the effect of gender on social media hours and age on physical issues and social media addiction (see Table 2 for details). In this study, the value of R2 on physical issues was substantially (75%), social media addiction was substantially (60%), and social media hours were higher than moderate (57%) because, in PLS-SEM, the R2 value of 0.60 would be considered as substantial, 0.33 could be classified as mode. In contrast, 0.19 could be considered as weak [43]. The values of Q2 presented in Table 2 were higher than zero, which implies that this model has predictive relevance [43].
Table 3 presents hypothesis testing and path coefficient for time interactions. To test the moderating role of time after the Covid lockdown, the variable time (in weeks) was added to the model. Again, the model had good predictive accuracy (R2>50%), and predictive relevance

(Q2>0) (see Table 3 for details), and hypothesis 6a revealed that the interaction term of time and anxiety has a positive effect on social media addiction ( = 0.06, p<0.001). Hypothesis 6c showed that the interaction term of time and social media addiction was significantly related positively related to social media hours ( = 0.04, p<0.01), and the result in hypothesis 6d suggests that the proposed model is well suited for confirming and explaining the positive effect of the interaction term of time and social media addiction on physical issues and all hypothesis reported in Table 3 was supported except hypothesis 6b. We found a positive association between anxiety, social media addiction and social media hours and the physical issue was stronger over time (see Fig 2a, 2c and 2d: Moderation Effects), and fear and social media addition so were not statistically significant, and time did not influence the relationship (see Fig 2b: Moderation Effects).
As shown in the Fig 3a (Time Anxiety ! Social Media Addiction), participants who reported anxiety always had higher levels of social media addiction. Considering the fluctuation across the six weeks, the social media addiction of participants who had anxiety increased over time, and the social media addiction of participants who did not have anxiety decreased over time (mean = 0.77, SD = 0.32). The social media addiction level tends to be the same between the beginning and the end of the six weeks (see Fig 3b: Time Fear !Social Media Addiction). Social media addiction was split into low (< = 0.75), which accounted for 38%, and high (= 1), which accounted for 62%. High social media addiction always had higher social media hours (Fig 3c: Time Social Media Addiction ! Social Media Hours) and physical issues (Fig 3d: Time Social Media Addiction ! Physical Issues) across the weeks, which confirms the result of H4.
Table 4 presents the Heterotrait-Monotrait Ratio (HTMT) results, and Table 3 indicates no discriminant validity problems according to the HTMT0.85 criterion, indicating that there are no overlapping items from the respondents and the instrument used in this study has no problem in establishing the discriminant validity. The Cronbach's Alpha and Composite Reliability were 0.78 and 0.86, respectively. These were both greater than the cut-off points of 0.6, confirming the reliability of the measurements. To achieve convergent validity, factor loadings should be greater than 0.7 [44]. The factor loadings of the four items relating to social media addiction were, "Do you spend a lot of time thinking about social media or planning to use social media?" "Do you feel urges to use social media more and more?" "Do you become restless or feel troubled if unable to use social media?" and "Do you use social media so much that it could cause a negative impact on your job or studies?" were 0.83, 0.81, 0.73 and 0.72, respectively. The Average Variance Extracted (AVE) of the latent construct of social media addiction was 0.60, which was greater than the cut-off point of 0.50. Therefore, convergent validity was achieved. The

heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT) values ranged from 0.01 to 0.84 across all single-indicator constructs in discriminant validity (see Table 2 for details). The reflective latent construct was lower than the cut-off point of 0.9 [45]. To examine the common method bias, Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) should be lower than 3.3 [46], and all VIFs ranged from 1.0 to 1.36.
To assess the formative construct, weights of the indicators should be significant without collinearity problems [47]. The indicators were all significant (p<0.05) without collinearity issues (VIF<3.3): back pain (weight = 0.40, t = 15.65, p<0.001, VIF = 2.36), numbness (weight = 0.45, t = 18.20, p<0.001, VIF = 1.90), and headaches (weight = 0.28, t = 10.69, p<0.001, VIF = 2.18).
Discussion
As addiction is defined as an irrepressible urge that is often accompanied by loss of control, internet addiction leads people to create problems from their uncontrollable abuse of Internet usage, which is related to other pathologies like depression, loneliness and social anxiety [48]. This current study aimed to examine how social media addiction and negative emotions influence health issues after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown among Bangladeshi workers.

Our study found that the anxiety level of the participants increased over the period of six weeks with the increase in social media addiction, which is in consonance with a past study from Turkey [49], which revealed that University students' social anxiety and happiness significantly forecast their addiction to social media. It is also consistent with several other previous studies [50-52]. This finding may be attributed to the fact that people who have communication difficulties in social environments and opt to create this kind of social interaction by the use of internet tools portray characteristics of social anxiety [53]. This is further buttressed by a past study [49] which found that happiness significantly forecasts university students' problematic internet use. They espoused that people who are content in their social environment and worry less about being evaluated in this environment normally do not seek different online communication tools--consequently, the possibility of their being addicted to social media declines.
A study in Bangladesh [54] aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety among Bangladeshi individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, vis-a-vis social media exposure (SME) and electronic media exposure (EME), backed the findings of the present study. Another past study revealed that perceived feelings of loneliness predicted both excessive social media use and anxiety, with excessive social media use also increasing anxiety levels [21]. In recent times, the use of social media has been highly lauded to receive health and safety information and ensure that social contacts are maintained to deal with the isolation of the pandemic [55]. Possibly due to the distressing situation, experts have suggested social media used to be a transient means of recovery from distress and as a coping strategy. This needs to be conscientiously managed to deal with loneliness and negative emotions [56]. Consequently, social media and virtual communities enable users to interact with other individuals, strengthen relationships, publicise content, portion out common interests, experiences, and emotions (e.g., [57]), and also enhance their engagement in digital platforms [58]. Nonetheless, there is the risk of social media involvement becoming excessive or dysfunctional by activating a behaviour-reward feedback loop [59] which strengthens negative moods and supports a vicious use of social media.
Surprisingly, the present study found a negative association between fear and social media addiction. The study showed that social media addiction decreases users' fear level, and fear level decreases with longer social media hours over the period of six weeks. This might be considered as the benefits of information exchange and peer support. Social media users can receive psychological support and advice from the people who are connected with them, which may help reduce their fear level. Thus, social interaction through social media, might positively affect the belief, ideas, and thoughts regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, social media use, which can aid build bridging, bonding, and maintained social capital [60].

Social media addiction and emotions--The moderating role of post-COVID timing
As the strongest factor, "working hours" is positively correlated with social media hours, social media addiction, and physical problems. The significance of this finding is that working professionals who are involved in social media usage during working hours are likely to be preoccupied with sustaining a sustained link with social media to make sure that they take part in all rewarding experiences being shared on these platforms. Eventually, such people exhibit decreased work efficiency (both decisional and action) and a reduction in work performance. Accordingly, our finding could be explained through the tenets of the limited capacity model [61], because of the fact that internet usage may burden the capacity of an individual to process information. Because of this burdened capacity, such users would not efficiently process workrelated information and delay making decisions or executing work-related tasks. That is to say, working professionals' internet usage during working hours may hinder their intellectual processing ability and re-direct them from achieving their primary work tasks, resulting in reduced reported work performance decrement. Our finding aligns with that of past studies, which indicate that daily social media use during working hours is a distraction which has a negative impact on employees' work performance [62]. The significant association between social media usage and hesitation is a new addition to the extant literature. It reveals that social media usage during working house can impact the decision-making ability and work efficiency of an individual, which, to our knowledge, has not been examined before.
On the contrary, other control variables such as leisure time, gender, education level and age are directly or indirectly negatively associated with physical issues. The study found that social media users with longer leisure time, higher education, and female have fewer physical problems caused by social media usage. Our finding of the association of social media users with longer leisure time and physical activity demonstrates that the there is a greater likelihood of engaging against not engaging in all three types of physical activity among internet users than among those who do not use the internet. Moreover, the results show that, contradictory to presumptions that spending a long time sitting at the computer may result in a sedentary lifestyle; weekly hours spent online were not significant predictors of the likelihood of engaging versus not engaging in physical activity. The results suggest a possible relationship between other Internet use components and physical activity.
Our finding of the association between social media users with higher education and physical activity suggests that there is a correlation between internet usage for studying and physical activity on the one hand, and between internet usage and social media on the other, suggesting that both studying and social media empower individuals to access information which could help them to develop particular plans for physical activity customized to their needs, perceptions, and abilities, whether strenuous or moderate. With regards to physical exercise to strengthen muscles, the particular digital uses, seeking information and playing games were identified as those which correlated with this type of physical activity. Looking for information is another activity which suggests a need for acquisition of knowledge and being competent in making plans about physical activity [63] independently.
The association between female social media users and physical activity showed that females had a stronger insight of ease of use, compatibility, relative advantage, and risk when they use social media, in comparison to men. This findings from the study also have been supported by some previous studies as well [64, 65]. More recent research, for instance, one by Lin and Wang [66] aimed to explain the differences in gender in information-sharing behavior on social networking sites. To accomplish this, a comparative theoretical model of information sharing between genders was established. Consistent with past research, analysis revealed a greater importance about that privacy risk, social ties, and commitment for women than men, because attitude towards information sharing impacts people's intention to share information more strongly for women than it does for men. Another recent research [67] made an attempt

Social media addiction and emotions--The moderating role of post-COVID timing
to examine gender differences in the use of social media by investigating adolescents aged 13- 18 years in the U.S. and UK. Results showed that adolescent girls spent more time on smartphones, social media, texting, and general computer use, compared with boys. However, no further assessment was conducted to ascertain how much of this time was spent to plan an activity.
Moreover, older people are less addicted to social media, causing fewer physical disorders. We observed that females were less addicted to social media than their male counterparts, and therefore are particularly less vulnerable regarding physical issues caused by social media addiction. Hence, it can be summarized that generally, males with long working hours spend more time on social media and become addicted to it and consequently become victims of several physical disorders.
As discussed above, there exists is a positive association between social media usage hours and social media addiction level. Therefore, we can combine the terms like social media addiction to discuss the effects of social media usage hours and its effect on physical issues and the effect of social media addiction on physical issues. Our study found that several physical problems related to physical issues increase with the increase of social media addiction levels. Several studies support the findings of the present study. For instance, a study in Iran [68] proposed a possible psychopathology mechanism to elucidate psychological distress among Iranian young adults during the COVID-19 public health crisis. There was a significant association between problematic social media use and psychological distress, both directly and indirectly.
Moreover, a study [69] conducted in a Tech based company in India also revealed that employees engaged in too much social media usage were having sleep deprivation; eye strain; feeling of resentment; lack of depth in the relationships; compromise with the work quality, and a distraction from work. Another study among social media users observed a number of physical, psychological and behavioural issues. Frequently seen physical problems included a strain on eyes, neck pain, back pain, headache, watering of eyes, wrist and shoulder pain, which were consistent with other studies [70]. However, some exogenous variables were also considered to see if any external factors influence the association between Internet addiction and physical issues in this study. The study found that "working hours" only positively correlated with physical issues.
There is a stronger role that social media could play, that could enable us to treat sociallyshaped diseases like obesity, depression, diabetes, heart disease, and other mental illnesses. A past study [71] outlined how social network thinking is growing, and described several current uses of social media in healthcare before describing how we could harness the understanding of social networks and media for this stronger role of treating socially physical and psychological diseases though on the platform, obsessive users have a higher prevalence of social encounters [72]. However, every aspect of daily living has been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, giving rise to forced isolation and practising social distancing, economic difficulty, and fears of being infected by a potentially fatal illness, that could make a person to feel helpless and hopeless [73]. Past research [74] expressed concern about the way and manner individuals have endured in the past so as to identify strategies which could be especially successful in controlling health issues and developing resilience during critical times.
Notwithstanding the fact that this current study was systematically designed, it was limited in a number of ways. Firstly, our results were based on only workers in government and nongovernment companies. Secondly, the study covered only workers aged between 25 and 45 years. Due to the fact that the PLS-SEM technique is new and easy to implement, we can extend the study to assess the influence of the pandemic lockdown on other aspects of life other than health, people aged outside the age bracket 25-45 years. Thirdly, despite the fact

Social media addiction and emotions--The moderating role of post-COVID timing
that research on the PLS-SEM method has gained popularity during in the last ten years, there are sufficient research opportunities on subjects like mediation or multi-group analysis, which necessitate further investigation.
Conclusion
The study is potentially significant because it will offer social media users, healthcare workers, and policymaker's insights into the adverse effect of addictive social media use. Most importantly, it will highlight the association of social media addiction with different issues related to our work, health, education, age, working hours, leisure time and gender, the very important issues at the centre of life.

Abstract
Background: An increasing number of undergraduate students in China have been reported to have psychological problems. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a series of preventive and control measures were implemented, which undoubtedly worsened their psychological health. Coping style and social support were probably important factors that affected the psychological well-being of undergraduate students during the pandemic. This study aimed to explore the effects of coping style and perceived social support on the psychological well-being of college students and relevant risk factors.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed in February and March of 2020 by distributing an online questionnaire among undergraduate students from seven geographical regions across China. The questionnaire included sociodemographic information; the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21); the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS); and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). For the analyses, t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Kruskal-Wallis test and multiple linear regression were utilized. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05.
Results: Among 3113 college students, the rates of anxiety, depression and stress symptoms were 13.3, 15.4 and 6.8%, respectively. Increased rates of current smoking and drinking (5.5 and 25.2%, respectively) among undergraduates were identified. The results indicated that the PSSS subscales and SCSQ subscales were significantly associated with DASS-21 scores (P < 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that active coping style and family support were protective factors while passive coping style could aggravate psychological problems among participants (P < 0.001).

Conclusions: A remarkable number of college students adopted passive coping strategies to cope with negative feelings, such as smoking and drinking, which were detrimental to their mental health. In contrast, active coping strategies helped improve their psychological well-being. Moreover, family support was particularly important for maintaining their mental health and ameliorating mental health challenges in this major health crisis. Consequently, suitable psychointervention, routine screening for risk behaviors, and provision of further social support are needed for undergraduate students in the COVID-19 pandemic or other emergency public health events.
Keywords: Coping style, Social support, Undergraduate students, Mental health, COVID-19

Background On January 30, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization, and it has caused severe economic, educational, and social ramifications [1, 2]. During the early epidemic, Chinese health authorities implemented a series of immediate measures to control the disease, and all Chinese people were required to stay at home for isolation; hence, normative teaching activities in universities were forced to stop. These measures, together with fear of infection and uncertainty regarding the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, undoubtedly had adverse psychological effects on people, especially university students [3, 4].
Colleges and universities have reported unprecedented numbers of students in psychological distress in recent years. This might be because inexperienced college students are incapable of solving problems in interpersonal relationships, academic challenges, and career development [5]. Several studies indicated that among university students, 9.7% in the eastern and western areas of China, 11.7% in Harbin, 11.8% at 6 universities in Wuhan, 16.8% in Anhui, and 32.82% in the western part of Liaoning experienced depression symptoms [6-10]. The COVID-19 pandemic may increase the stress of undergraduate students or expose them to new stressors that can be frustrating and lead to a range of mental health problems. The frequent contributors to increased stress/anxiety were general uncertainty regarding the pandemic, the precipitous transition to and participation in online classes, and the COVID-19-related influences on their lives [11-13]. The results of a recent study confirmed that students are at high risk of developing depression and suicidality in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak [14]. With the quick closures of universities, students encountered uncertainty and concern about their academic future, social isolation and lack of support, such as limited access to and receipt of mental health services for many vulnerable youths, which were barriers to relieving their stress or negative thinking [15-17].
People's mental health is affected in many ways. Social support and coping strategies have been proven to be protective factors for mental health in previous studies

[18-21]. Social support refers to the provision of practical help, emotional support and information assistance by meaningful groups around an individual when the individual is in distress, such as family members, friends, colleagues, relatives and neighbors [22]. Several studies have shown that younger adults and people with greater social strain or less social support have worse mental health and that perceived social support influences the overall outcome of depression and plays a key role in recovery from affective disorders [23-26]. Coping refers to the thoughts and behaviors people use to manage the internal and external demands of stressful events [27]. Positive coping and negative coping are diametrically opposed coping styles. Individuals who adopted mainly positive coping strategies suffered less emotional distress, while those who adopted negative coping strategies experienced the opposite [28]. Therefore, when people face difficult or complex negative events, the coping style they choose is of the utmost importance, which will affect their psychosocial outcomes and, especially, their mental health.
According to a narrative review, there are numerous pandemic-related mental health risks for children and adolescents, and the subsequent restrictions produce more threats, which may lead to adverse psychological problems [29]. While previous studies have explored the effects of social support and coping style on mental health, they did not identify their impacts on Chinese college students' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they had various limitations, such as the use of unstandardized psychological measures, the assessment of single mental health symptoms, and the use of samples that were selected mostly from a single city or university [22, 30-32]. On this basis, the current study is a multicenter (7 cities) study in China, covers a larger population in terms of sample size, and the purpose of it is to better understand the impacts of coping style and perceived social support on mental health and associated risk factors in undergraduate students to inform effective intervention strategies in similar public health events.

geographical regions across China. We collected data among college students from various cities by distributing online questionnaires via Wenjuanxing, which is an online crowdsourcing platform in mainland China, in February and March of 2020. The sample size was calculated using a margin of error of 5%, a confidence level of 95%, a response distribution of 50% and a previous estimate rate of depression symptoms of 23.8%, which produced a minimum sample size of 558 [33]. Snowball sampling was used to invite potential study participants. We initially invited investigators from the seven partner institutions, and they forwarded a link to the questionnaire to contacts who they deemed suitable. Finally, data were collected from 4408 participants, and 3113 completed the questionnaire survey (the response rate was 70.62%), which satisfied the minimum sample size.
A brief introduction to the study was displayed to participants, and electronic informed consent was obtained before the start of the questionnaire survey. Upon completion of the informed consent form, they completed the online questionnaire. The inclusion criteria were that the respondents were at least 18 years old and volunteered to complete this online survey. Respondents who were not college students, had a cognitive impairment or felt that using electronic devices was difficult were excluded.

others. Each item is rated by participants on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 7 = strongly agree), with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived support. The Chinese version of the PSSS has adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's  = 0.84) among adolescents, and the Cronbach's alpha values of the friend, family and significant other subscales were 0.81, 0.92 and 0.83, respectively [38]. In this study, the Cronbach's alpha values of the total scale and the family, friend, and significant other dimensions were 0.94, 0.88, 0.93 and 0.87, respectively.
Simplified coping style questionnaire Coping style was measured by the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). The 20-item Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire measures an individual's coping style to understand its relationship with psychosomatic health using a 4-point Likert scale (0 = never; 3 = very often) [39]. The instrument has been used frequently in China, with satisfactory reliability and validity [40]. This scale consists of 20 items and is composed of 2 subscales: active coping (12 items) and passive coping (8 items) [41]. In our study, this scale has satisfactory reliability and validity for both active coping styles (Cronbach's  = 0.89) and passive coping styles (Cronbach's  = 0.80).

Measurements Sociodemographics In the questionnaire, sociodemographic information was collected from all participants, including gender, ethnicity, date of birth, residence place, grade, major, smoking and drinking statuses and health condition.
Depression, anxiety and stress scale Depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were measured using the Chinese version of the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Respondents rated each item from 0 (does not apply to me at all) to 3 (applies to me very much) on a 4-point rating scale based on their feelings or experiences over the past week. The DASS-21 consists of three subscales (each with 7 items), which measure depression, anxiety, and stress [34, 35]. The DASS-21 has been validated in Chinese populations, and the Cronbach's alpha values of the three subscales of the DASS-21 were 0.823, 0.811 and 0.861, respectively, and 0.935 overall [35-37]. In this study, the Cronbach's alpha values of the stress, anxiety and depression subscales were 0.861, 0.812, and 0.826, respectively.
Perceived social support scale The perceived social support scale (PSSS) is a 12-item self-reported inventory that measures the respondents' perceived support from family, friends and significant

Statistical analysis Data were analyzed with SPSS Version 24.0 with the level of significance determined at a 0.05 p value. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percent distributions, while continuous variables were presented as means ± standard deviations (SDs). An analysis of descriptive statistics was conducted to examine the demographic and other selected characteristics of the respondents. The t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare the differences among subgroups. The bivariate Pearson correlation for continuous variables was calculated to determine the association between psychological impact and coping style and social support dimensions. Multiple linear regression was used to explore the psychological impact and its potential factors by adjusting the variables that were significant in a univariate analysis at P  0.10. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05.

attitudes of the participants toward the COVID-19 pandemic included pessimistic (93.8%), neutral (2.0%) and optimistic (4.1%) attitudes. 85.2, 4.2 and 0.4% of the students had confirmed cases in their current city, community or village and among their relatives and friends, respectively. The results showed that 5.5% of the participants were smokers and 25.2% were drinkers. Moreover, of the undergraduates who participated in this study, 13.3% had anxiety symptoms, 478 (15.4%) were depressed, and 6.8% felt stressed.
Univariate analysis of anxiety, depression and stress symptoms According to the univariate analysis (see Table 2), males had higher symptom scores than females, and older students had higher scores than younger students (P < 0.05). College students of Han ethnicity had lower scores than minority students. Among them, those who reported being in fair or poor health were more likely to have symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress than those who were healthy (P < 0.05). Additionally, students who were required to quarantine or isolate had a higher risk of developing depression symptoms during the lockdown than students without such experience (P < 0.05). Respondents who had confirmed cases among relatives and friends were more likely to suffer from anxiety than students whose relatives and friends were not infected (P < 0.05). Participants with confirmed cases in their current city had higher depression symptom scores than their counterparts (P < 0.05). Students with an optimistic attitude toward COVID-19 were less likely to have psychological problems (P < 0.001) than those who were pessimistic or natural. College students who were current smokers or drinkers had higher scores than those who were not (P < 0.05).
Correlations between anxiety, depression, stress and coping style and perceived social support dimensions The results of the bivariate Pearson correlation analysis in Table 3 indicated that the PSSS family, friend, and significant other subscale scores and total support score had significant negative associations with the DASS-21 anxiety, depression, and stress symptom scores (P < 0.001). The SCSQ active coping dimension also showed significant negative correlations with the DASS-21 anxiety (r = - 0.127, P < 0.001), depression (r = - 0.204, P < 0.001) and stress scores (r = - 0.146, P < 0.001). In contrast, passive coping on the SCSQ had significant positive correlations with the anxiety (r = 0.234, P < 0.001), depression (r = 0.230, P < 0.001) and stress symptom scores (r = 0.219, P < 0.001).

Multiple linear regression analysis of factors that influence college students' mental health The results of the multiple linear models with the DASS-21 subscale score as the dependent variable are presented in Table 4. Older age was positively related to higher depression ( =0.111, P < 0.001) and stress scores ( =0.126, P < 0.001). In contrast to fair or poor health, good health was negatively associated with the anxiety, depression and stress subscale scores (P < 0.001). Having quarantine or isolation experience was positively correlated with depression ( = 0.298, P < 0.05). Having confirmed cases in the current city of residence was a risk factor for depression ( = 0.305, P < 0.05). Moreover, the results suggested a positive association between having confirmed cases among relatives and friends and anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms (P < 0.001). Participants who had pessimistic or neutral attitudes were more likely to be anxious, depressive and stressed (P < 0.001).
Perceived family support and the adoption of an active coping style were protective factors against poor mental health, including anxiety, depression and stress, in college students (P < 0.001). Passive coping styles were significantly associated with lower levels of psychological well-being (P < 0.001). No significant differences were found in the support from friends and significant others and DASS dimensions (P > 0.05).
Discussion Experiencing epidemics or natural disasters could lead to long-term psychological disorders in various populations [42, 43]. The rates of probable anxiety, depression and stress symptoms among Chinese undergraduate students in our investigation were 13.3, 15.4 and 6.8%, respectively. Among the symptoms, the prevalence of depression symptoms was higher than the 9.7% prevalence in the eastern and western areas of China, 11.7% prevalence in Harbin, and 11.8% prevalence at 6 universities in Wuhan and lower than the prevalence (32.82%) in the western part of Liaoning, as reported in previous studies during the pre-COVID-19 era [6-8, 10]. Our study was conducted during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and during the traditional "Chinese New Year" festival, when college students stop their work or study plans to enjoy the holiday and might experience less stress and negative emotions than usual. Thus, the rate of depressive symptoms in the current study during this period may be lower than those reported in studies that were conducted in other areas during other periods. In addition, while the smoking rate among all Chinese individuals was approximately 26.6% in 2018 with an overall declining trend in recent years, it is possible that some started to smoke or drink in the extreme situation due to the pandemic as a coping strategy. The current smoking rate of 5.5% (16.3% of male

students) and current drinking rate of 25.2% (48.3% of male students) were higher than the rates before the outbreak among college students [44-46].
During the COVID-19 pandemic, tobacco and alcohol misuse are additional public health issues that can cause risk-taking behaviors and mental health issues, especially among undergraduate students, who are still undergoing intellectual and social skill development. Consistent with other studies, students who were current smokers or drinkers were more likely to be anxious, depressive and stressed. In addition, mentally ill people were more likely to be current smokers or substance users than those who did not have a mental illness, and large proportions of smokers (88.7%) and past smokers (97%) reported the onset of smoking before their mental illness was diagnosed in another study [47]. Some of the college students who were current smokers or drinkers might already have had worse psychological health than their counterparts, and the pandemic might have aggravated their problems and caused them to suffer from huge mental health crises. The findings of a recent study revealed that a deterioration of mental health occurred among smokers and binge drinkers during the COVID-19 pandemic and that their tobacco and alcohol consumptions increased since the lockdown [48]. Therefore, the current study highlights the need to screen both mental health status and substance use behaviors among undergraduate students when a similar pandemic or public health emergency occurs. Apart from providing suitable mental health counseling services, family members and school administrators should also pay attention to smoking and drinking behaviors in such circumstances and provide effective smoking cessation and binge drinking interventions if necessary.
Stress is a highly individual reaction, and its effect on mental health varies from person to person. When people face various levels of stress, they might either be motivated and perform effectively or cope inappropriately and be overwhelmed by the stress. The

stressors for students while quarantined were diversiform, and the sources of stress included academic pressure, campus relationships, loneliness and COVID-19-related uncertainty [49]. Coping strategy is a critical factor that affects psychological well-being. In this research, passive coping strategies had a negative role in regulating students' mental health, which were frequently utilized by young people aged 14-35 [50]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, students used their preferred coping strategy to alleviate the increasing amount of stress they experienced, such as seeking help from others (friends, family, school teachers and experts), attempting to solve their problems on their own or coping passively. Negative coping is always emotion-focused or avoidant coping and refers to attempts to avoid actively confronting the problem or to indirectly reduce emotional tension via various behaviors, such as eating or smoking [51, 52]. In the passive coping subscale that was used in the current study, there was an item named "relieve worries by smoking, drinking, taking drugs and overeating", and 29.4% of the respondents self-reported that they had adopted this strategy. It seems that if students have psychological disorders or are under levels of stress, they are likely to develop health risk behaviors such as the use of cigarettes, liquor, or marijuana, if available. Hence, the higher rates of smoking and drinking among the study participants can be interpreted as indicating that these indirect and evasive behaviors were performed to reduce emotional tension, which may be a sign of negative coping. In contrast, an active coping style positively contributed to adjustment to psychological distress and relief of negative feelings. Coping styles are based on the cognitive evaluation of stressful situations where the relationship between an individual and the stressful situation constantly changes with the individual's actions [53]. Evidence suggests that depression and anxiety symptoms can, in turn, exert deleterious effects on the ability of late adolescents to effectively cope with daily stressors [54]. It is necessary for interventions to focus on

helping students avoid negative coping strategies and cultivate optimistic thinking styles to reduce the risk of the onset of mental health problems.
In line with our hypotheses, family support was a protective factor for the psychological well-being of

undergraduate students, while support from friends and others did not significantly affect their well-being, which was inconsistent with previous studies that reported that people could be inspired by friends [30, 55]. As face-toface interactions and random encounters are minimized

Huang et al. BMC Psychiatry (2021) 21:530

due to social distancing measures, it is likely that individuals focus on relationships that are spatially close, most meaningful, or most established [16]. During the early COVID-19 pandemic, almost all undergraduate students were on winter holiday and quarantined or isolated at home. They spent most of their time with their family members and had much less contact with friends or other people. Therefore, we should pay attention to the role of family support in maintaining college students' mental health in such a special context, particularly among students who live with dysfunctional families or divorced families or orphans who lack sufficient family support, as they may be more prone to develop health risk behaviors and mental illness [56, 57]. Effective communication between parents and their undergraduate children has been proven to play an important role in maintaining good psychological health in terms of self-esteem, socioemotional adjustment and well-being [58]. However, parent-child communication gaps are quite common due to the widespread use of electronic devices, the special life stages of undergraduate students and the advanced society. A lack of communication between parents and their children may be one risk factor that increases their vulnerability if parents use more maladaptive coping strategies or if their family atmosphere is characterized by irritability after the disaster [59]. Parents should have the ability to identify the differences they have with their children and overcome those barriers to understanding each other. Meanwhile, support from health educators and public health specialists should be provided in early intervention programs to promote better mental health and prevent the initiation of health risk behaviors such as substance use.
This survey also explored other risk factors that are related to the psychological problems of undergraduate students. The results indicated that the scores of stress symptoms were significantly higher in minorities than in students of Han ethnicity, which is partly because these poorer minorities are more likely to have more difficulty implementing prevention measures and their overall burdens of disease were heavier [60]. On the other hand, ethnic minorities in remote areas may have more concerns about household income, inconvenience of online teaching activities, scarce living resources and shortages of medical resources. Moreover, areas that are close to the border were in a more severe situation during the pandemic due to cases that were imported from abroad. The results also showed a positive relationship between good physical health and mental health among the participants, and obviously, good physical condition might give participants more power to face emergency public health events and enable them avoid exposure to the dual burden of the COVID-19 pandemic and other chronic diseases [31]. Moreover, it appeared that a

worsening of mental health was associated with more worries about one's family and friends, especially when their friends or family members were infected with COVID-19, which was also consistent with other relevant studies [32, 61].
The current study showed that COVID-19 does have negative psychological effects on college students, and we found that adopting active coping styles can improve their psychological problems. In particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic, family support was a significant protective factor for the psychological well-being of undergraduate students, while support from friends and others was not effective in this case. According to our results, college students should adopt positive coping styles when facing difficulties, setbacks or unexpected events to reduce their probability of suffering from psychological disorders. Social support is one source of positive coping for students, particularly family support in the current study. However, at present, there are an increasing number of dysfunctional families, and many students lack communication with their parents. These students are in urgent need of attention to their psychological status. Therefore, it is crucial for college students to have a positive way of thinking and avoid negative strategies (e.g., tobacco and alcohol use) to cope with challenges, and suitable psychological assistance or intervention is necessary to maintain their well-being and reduce the severity of their psychological problems.
Limitations Although this study provided essential findings, it has various limitations. The convenient sampling method and the nature of the survey (internet-based) limit the generalizability of the survey results by generating selection bias. However, during rapidly evolving infectious disease outbreaks, an online survey could produce meaningful results. Second, all the measurements in the current study were assessed by self-report; thus, response bias may exist. Third, females and medical students comprised the majority of the sample in this study, and these two groups may be at additional risk for psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the generalizability of the study results to the general student population may be limited.
Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased psychiatric problems among undergraduate students, and some students used smoking or drinking to cope with difficulties, setbacks or unexpected events during the pandemic, which were negative behaviors that probably aggravated their mental illnesses. Meanwhile, the current study demonstrated that adopting an active coping style and receiving suitable family support can strengthen the

ability of college students to regulate their bad emotions, relieve various pressures and cope with psychological disorders. Given the vulnerability of college students who adopt passive coping strategies and have little social support for poor mental health, universities and health authorities should focus on addressing their psychological needs, particularly among students who lack sufficient family support, by screening both mental health status and substance use behaviors, providing highquality and timely crisis-oriented psychological services and formulating effective strategies to ameliorate their mental health problems, especially during future infectious disease outbreaks.

Abstract
Background: Previous studies on the association of online courses and mental health were mainly conducted in uni versities, and no study investigated the relationship between characteristics of online courses and children's mental health in primary and secondary school. This study aimed to explore the association of online courses and children's mental health in primary and secondary school.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey among 540 primary and secondary school students and their parents in the eastern, central and western region of China from April to May in 2020. Children's mental health was assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Borderline mental health problems (SDQ total difficulties score16) and mental health problems (SDQ total difficulties score20) were defined according to Goodman's standard. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to examine the association between online courses and children's mental health.
Results: Compared with those who did not have problems of online courses, children having the difficulty in under standing the content of online courses had a higher SDQ total difficulties score [=1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89, 2.71] and a higher risk of borderline mental health problems [odds ratio (OR)=1.93, 95%CI: 1.07, 3.49], while device or internet connection problems were not significantly associated with children's mental health. Compared with children who had live courses, those having video-recorded courses had a higher SDQ total difficulties score (=0.90, 95%CI: 0.01, 1.80). Children who spent more than 4 h on online courses had a higher SDQ total difficulties score than those of less than or equal to 4 h (=0.95, 95%CI: 0.09, 1.81).
Conclusion: We found that online courses with inappropriate characteristics were associated with children's mental health. The findings called for the efforts to optimize the online courses and improve children's mental health.

mental health problems around the world [1]. World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that childhood mental health was responsible for 16% of global burden of disease and injury among children and adolescents aged 10-19 years [2]. Many mental health problems begin in childhood and then continue into adulthood [3]. Children with mental health problems were more likely to have poor performance at school [4] and develop communicable and non-communicable diseases [5]. Evidence showed that early interventions

for mental health problems could have long-term benefit for children and adolescents [6]. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the modifiable risk factors associated with mental health problems of children as early as possible.
Previous studies on the risk factors of mental health have mainly focused on individual characteristics and environment in the society, family, and school, with few investigating the effect of online courses. Online courses are one of the important education methods nowadays. Many universities around the world have implemented online courses for many years, and more and more children in primary and secondary school have also received online courses due to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although online courses provide more flexibilities in terms of place, time, and pace of learning, children may also face a lot of challenges which may affect children's mental health, such as unstable internet connection, lack of device, difficulties in catching up with online courses, and distraction in learning through a computer for a long time [7]. In this context, online courses could affect children's mental health. Previous studies suggested that online courses have a detrimental effect on mental health of students in the university [8-14]. However, there is no available epidemiological evidence regarding the effect of online courses on mental health of primary and secondary school students, who might be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of online courses.
Moreover, there is another gap in understanding the association of online courses and children's mental health. Identifying beneficial and harmful characteristics of online courses could help to improve online courses and facilitate children's mental health. However, previous studies in universities mainly focused on whether online students had mental health problems, and the relationship between characteristics of online courses (i.e., content, type, and time of online courses) and children's mental health remained unclear.
Meanwhile, the association between online courses and mental health of children may depend on other influencing factor, such children's school stage (primary school or secondary school). Therefore, assessment of effect modification is also necessary to better understand the relationship between online courses and children's mental health.
The aim of the current study was to assess the association of characteristics of online courses with mental health of children in primary and secondary school. We also explored potential effect modification by school stage.

Methods
Study design and participants The cross-sectional study was conducted among primary and secondary school students and their parents from April to May in 2020 by an electronic survey based on the Wenjuanxing platform (https://www.wjx.cn/ app/survey.aspx), during the pandemic of COVID-19 in China. Students were selected in 9 cities of the eastern (Beijing, Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province and Dalian in Liaoning Province), central (Zhengzhou in Henan Province, Changchun in Jilin Province and Changzhi in Shanxi Province) and western region (Zhongwei in Ningxia Province, Tongliao in Inner Mongolia and Nanning in Guangxi Province) of China, according to the recommend of National Bureau of Statistics of China (http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/zxfb/201911/t2019 1119_1710340.html). The inclusion criteria were as follows: Firstly, children were chosen from the fifth to sixth grade in primary school or first to second grade in secondary school. Secondly, children whose schools were not reopened due to lockdown policy of COVID19. Thirdly, children and their parents agreed to participate in the survey. If children reported to have chronic diseases or disability, they were excluded. Finally, 540 children and their parents were included in our study. The electronic questionnaires were completed anonymously. The 515 questionnaires were included in the analysis after excluding 25 students who didn't have online courses.
We calculated the sample size according to a previous study in China [15], in which longer screen time (>2 h/ day) was associated with 1.93 (95%CI: 1.16, 3.21) times higher risk of students' mental health problem in China. Because students had online courses by using electronic device (i.e., computer, pad, or smart phone), we assumed that longer online course time (>4 h/day, about 7 classes with 35 min/class, or 6 classes with 40 min/class) could have a similar effect on children' mental health. By assuming that children with inappropriate characteristics of online course had 1.93 (95%CI: 1.16, 3.21) times higher risk of students' mental health problem, the prevalence of mental health problem was about 20% in the whole population [1], =0.05, and 1-=0.80, we calculated the sample size of 380. We assumed the non-response rate was 5%, and the final sample size was 399. We included 515 participants in final analysis, therefore, the sample size was sufficient to detect the differences. The exact nonresponse rate was not clear, because the survey was an online voluntary investigation. However, most children's parents did not go to work and had much spare time during the survey period. Besides, the survey reached the required sample size quickly. Therefore, we thought the non-response rate was very low.

Mental health measurement The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) [16] was used to assess Children's mental health problems in the study. SDQ is a self-report screening questionnaire that measures emotional and behavioral problems. It is composed of 25 items subdivided in five subscales with five items each: emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems, and prosocial behavior. Each item is scored on a three-point scale (0=Not true, 1=Somewhat true, and 2=Certainly true). All subscales excluding the prosocial behavior can be summed to generate the total score, ranging from 0 to 40. The higher score indicates more severe emotional and behavioral problems. We applied the cut-off points of 16 and 20 to define the children's mental health status according to Goodman's standard (http://www.sdqinfo.com). Normal mental health status was defined as SDQ total difficulties score0 and15; borderline mental health status, SDQ total difficulties score16 and<20; abnormal mental health status, SDQ total difficulties score20 and40. We then divides children into borderline mental health problems (SDQ total difficulties score 16-40) vs normal mental health (SDQ total difficulties score 0-15) and mental health problems (SDQ total difficulties score 20-40) vs normal mental health (SDQ total difficulties score 0-15). The Chinese self-report version of the SDQ for 4-17-yearolds has been shown to have good psychometric properties [17]. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.81 for the SDQ total difficulties score in the population in Chinese children [17]. The SDQ for 4-17-year-olds was completed by students themselves in the study.
Investigation of online course We asked children about the characteristics of online courses. The questions included problems in online courses (Question- "Do you have any problems in online courses" and answer- "No/Difficulty in understanding the content of online courses/ Device or internet connection problems"), main type of online courses (Question- "What is the main type of your online courses" and answer- "E-learning material without video/ Videorecorded courses/ Live courses"), and online courses time per day ("How many hours do you have online courses every day").
Covariates information We selected a range of covariates based on the prior knowledge [18-26], including covariates answered by parents: region (eastern region/central region/ western region), parental educational level (primary or secondary school/high or vocational high school/

junior college or university/master or above), family monthly income (less than 1000 yuan/1000-3000 yuan/ 3000-5000 yuan/more than 5000 yuan), frequency of children's bad mood (often/sometimes/never), relationship between children and their parents (very good/ good/general/bad/very bad), restriction for going out of housing community during the past one month (no /yes, but go out many times a day /yes, but go out once a day /yes, but go out every two days / yes, but go out every three days or more /yes, can't go out); covariates answered by children: children's gender (boy/girl), age (years), screen time per day (hours), outdoor physical activity time (hours), and academic performance (below average/average/above average).
Statistical analyses Continuous variables were presented as mean (SD) and categorical variables were presented as numbers (percentage). Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-square test were applied to compare the differences among children with normal mental health status, borderline mental health status, and abnormal mental health status. Multivariable linear regression for continuous outcome (SDQ total difficulties score) and logistic regression for binary outcome (borderline mental health problems and mental health problems) were used to examine the associations of online course with mental health of children, respectively. We began with the crude model (model 1). In model 2, we adjusted for region. Model 3 was further adjusted with the family socioeconomic status, i.e., parental educational level and family monthly income. Then model 4 was additionally adjusted with gender, age, screen time, outdoor physical activity time and academic performance of children. Then model 5 was further adjusted with the policy to control COVID-19 (i.e., restriction for going out of housing community during the past one month). Finally, in the fully adjusted model (model 6), we further adjusted for the frequency of children's bad mood and relationship between children and their parents. We showed the results of crude model and fully adjusted model in main paper and the results of other models were shown in the supplementary file.
Stratified analyses were performed to assess effect modification of school stage (primary school or secondary school). We performed the Wald test for the interaction term between online courses and school stage.
All statistical analyses were performed in the statistical software R 3.6.1 (R Core Team 2019). The Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) was used to assess the model fit. A P value<0.05 for the two-sided test was considered as statistically significant.

Results The characteristics of the participants were presented in Table 1. Of the children, 55 (6.0%) had borderline mental health status and 31 (10.7%) had abnormal mental health status. The means and standard deviations of SDQ total difficulties score were 8.2±3.4, 17.2±1.0 and 21.9±2.8 in children with normal, borderline, and abnormal mental health status, respectively, Children with abnormal mental health status were more likely to have longer screen time, and have bad mood more frequently, and their relationship with their parents were less likely to be good or very good. The restriction for going out of housing community during the past one month was stricter in children with abnormal mental health status. There were no significant differences in the other characteristics (residential region, parental age, gender, education level, family income, family type, children's gender, age, academic performance, and outdoor physical activity time) among the three groups.
There were 33.7% of students who had the difficulty in understanding the content of online courses, while 3.8% of students had the equipment or network connection problems. There were 58.8% of students having the live courses while 31.8% having the video-recorded courses. The mean online courses time per day was 3.8±2.0 h (Table 2).
In the analyses with multivariable linear model, we adjusted for the covariates gradually (Table S1). When we adjusted for children's mood and the relationship between children and their parents, regression coefficient of the association between online courses and children's SDQ total difficulties score became obviously decreased. After fully adjusting for covariates (Table 3), compared with those who did not have problems of online courses, children who had the difficulty in understanding the content of online courses had a higher SDQ total difficulties score (=1.80, 95%CI: 0.89, 2.71), while device or internet connection problems were not significantly associated with SDQ total difficulties score. Compared with children who had live courses, those who had video-recorded courses had a higher SDQ total difficulties score (=0.90, 95%CI: 0.01, 1.80), while the type of E-learning material without video was not significantly associated with SDQ total difficulties score. Children who spent more than 4 h on online courses had a higher SDQ total difficulties score (=0.95, 95%CI: 0.09, 1.81) than those of less than or equal to 4 h.
As shown in Table 4, Tables S2 and S3, compared with those who did not have problems of online courses, children who had the difficulty in understanding the content of online courses had a higher risk of borderline mental health problems (OR=1.93, 95%CI: 1.07, 3.49).

We also explored the possible effect modification of children's school stage between characteristics of online courses and SDQ total difficulties score (Table 5). We found significant associations of SDQ total difficulties score with video-recorded courses (=1.36, 95%CI: 0.02, 2.70) and online course with more than 4 h (=2.40, 95%CI: 0.73, 4.06) in primary school students, while not significant in secondary school students. The difficulty in understanding the content of online courses was associated with a higher SDQ total difficulties score in both primary school students (=1.91, 95%CI: 0.50, 3.31) and secondary school students (=1.54, 95%CI: 0.27, 2.81). We didn't find a significant interaction between characteristics of online courses and children's school stage.
Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study to investigate the association between online courses and mental health of primary and secondary school students. We found that difficulty in understanding the content of online courses, video-recorded type of online courses, and longer online course time were associated with higher SDQ total difficulties score of children. Children who had the difficulty in understanding the content of online courses had a higher risk of borderline mental health problems.
In this study, we found that the difficulty in understanding the content of online courses was associated with not only higher SDQ total difficulties score, but also higher risk of borderline mental health problem of children. Unlike the face-to-face courses, students had limited interaction with teachers in online courses and may have more difficulties in understanding the content of courses. The difficulty in understanding the content of courses was identified as a common academic stressor [27], which has been shown to have negative effect on mental health of students [12, 24]. In our study, we found that nearly one third of students had the difficulty in understanding the content of courses, especially the percentage is high of 43.7% in western region of China. Therefore, attention should be paid on whether children have the difficulty in understanding the content of online courses and supports should be provided for those who do have difficulties, especially in western region of China. We did not find any significant association between device or internet connection problems and children's mental health, probably due to limited children with these problems (only 3.8%). Further studies with larger sample size are needed to validate our findings.
Compared with live courses, attending the videorecorded online courses was associated with a higher SDQ total difficulties score. One of the key differences between live courses and video-recorded courses was

the relative lack of interactions between teachers and students in video-recorded courses, which may prevent students from fully grasping the course information. Therefore, teachers should be encouraged to provide as many live courses as possible for students, which can

facilitate students' understanding of online courses, and improve their mental health. However, some schools did not choose the live type of online courses with the consideration of internet connection issue, education resources (i.e., lack of funding or device) and teachers' online teaching ability. Since concerted efforts have been made by many organizations in China, students were guaranteed to access to online education with the fast and stable internet [28]. Thus, more endeavor should be made to train teachers in order to equip them with highquality online teaching abilities.
We investigated the association between online course time and children's SDQ total difficulties score, and found that children who spent more than 4 h per day (about 7 classes with 35 min/class, or 6 classes with 40 min/class) on online courses had higher SDQ total difficulties score. The result was consistent with the previous finding that increased school's instruction time had an adverse effect on mental health problem among students [29]. Longer course time increases

students' fatigue and academic stress, which in turn results in mental health problem [24]. Moreover, when children spend longer time on online courses, they will have limited time to do other activities which have benefits on mental health (i.e., physical activities or communication with their parents) [20, 23].
We found that the associations between characteristics of online courses and mental health in primary school students and secondary school students were not significantly different. When stratified by school stage, the smaller sample size contributed to lower statistical power. However, we found that video-recorded online courses and longer online course time were significantly associated with higher SDQ total difficulties score in primary school students. Primary school students may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of inappropriate characteristics of online courses, because they are younger than secondary school students and might have a lower adaptive capacity to the online courses. Therefore, more attention should be paid on mental health in primary school students when they have online courses.
Even though our results showed that online courses were not significantly associated with mental health problems (defined as SDQ total difficulties score>20), the increased risk of borderline mental health problems or merely increased SDQ total difficulties score can also reveal that online courses with inappropriate characteristics were associated with children's mental health. Interestingly, when we adjusted for the children's mood and the relationship between parents and children, the regression coefficients between online courses and children's mental health have decreased. Evidence suggested that the positive relationship between parents and children has protective effect on children's mental health [18, 30]. Therefore, parents should pay attention to children's mood and make efforts to improve the parent-children relationships, which may be an effective measure to mitigate the detrimental effect of online courses on the children's mental health.
Our study had great importance. Although online courses has developed rapidly around the world and become an alternative or supplementary type of education, the shift to online courses is made at very short notice and large-scale online courses lack practical application scenarios, especially in primary and secondary school. It's suggested that deep investigations on the online education are required to provide evidence for appropriate online courses [31]. The study has investigated the association between online courses and children's mental health in primary and secondary school and provided some evidence for optimizing school's online courses. Although it is a cross-sectional study, the

finding can also partially help to improve online courses, which may facilitate mental health of children.
There were some notable strengths in our study. First, we surveyed the participants from 9 cities in the eastern, central, and western region of China, which facilitates us to obtain results from socioeconomically different regions. What's more, this was the first study to investigate the association between school's online courses and mental health of children. However, several limitations of the present study should be mentioned. First, given the cross-sectional design of our study, it is impossible to infer causality of the relationship between characteristics of online courses and children's mental health. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm the results obtained from our study in the future. Second, although we adjusted for several covariates, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual confounding factors. Third, our study selected limited participants in every city. Forth, even though we selected participants from 9 cities in the eastern, central, and western region of China, the schools were not selected randomly. The generalization of our finding may be limited. Therefore, further studies using random sampling with larger sample size are needed to investigate the association between online courses and children's mental health.
Conclusion In conclusion, we found that online courses with inappropriate characteristics were associated with children's mental health. The findings called for efforts to optimize the online courses and improve children's mental health.

The suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection in a Charcot-MarieTooth patient undergoing postsurgical rehabilitation: the value of telerehabilitation for evaluation and continuing treatment
Valeria Pradaa, Emilia Bellonea,b, Angelo Schenonea,b and Marina Grandisa,b

We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a probable COVID-19 infection in a 28-year-old man with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The diagnosis was established through a remote interaction with the patient after early discharge from outpatient therapy due to upcoming traveling restrictions. The COVID-19 disease appeared mild, without major respiratory problems, and no obvious neuromuscular deterioration was reported or observed. Telerehabilitation provided an opportunity to continue with hand rehabilitation after tendon transfer surgery, perform an ad-hoc online evaluation, and advise the patient how to prevent the spread of infection and cope with restrictions limiting outpatient visits. This experience seems valuable for further development of telerehabilitation in anticipation of future pandemics or

adversarial events since it allows reaching out to patients unable to travel and overcomes the need for regular outpatient visits. International Journal of Rehabilitation Research 43: 285-286 Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

Introduction The emergence of COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus was proclaimed a `pandemic' by the WHO on 11 March 2020 (Sohrabi et al., 2020; WHO, 2020). As of this writing, more than 700 000 people around the world tested positive on the SARS-Cov-2 virus (Dey et al., 2020). Only in Italy, more than 100 000 people were affected and that number is rapidly increasing (Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020). In Italy and other countries affected by this pandemic, cities have been on lockdown to reduce the spread of infection (Reluga, 2010). The consequences are overwhelming, including a sudden interruption of `standard' rehabilitation for most patients, whether affected by SARS-Cov-2 or not.
Case report We highlight here the first reported case of suspected COVID-19 infection in a patient with Charcot-MarieTooth (CMT) disease, the most common hereditary neuropathy (Carine et al., 2016), and how a remote rehabilitation approach allowed monitoring, continued administration of physical therapy after hand surgery, and informal evaluation of the progress. A 28-year-old man affected by CMT1X, an X-linked form of CMT disease, underwent in December of 2019, a tendon transfer surgery in the left hand (from the superficial flexor of the ring finger to the thumb for improving opposition). Hand rehabilitation proceeded as planned three times a

week. The focus was on the recovery of the joint range of motion with passive and active exercises of the thumb and the ring finger and, progressively, the use of rubber band and Theraputty paste. Exercises were dosed to avoid overwork weakness, which can occur in this neuropathy (Vinci et al., 2003; van Pomeren et al., 2009; Prada et al., 2018). Physiotherapy proceeded until 4 March 2020, when it was suspended because of the upcoming Italian lockdown date (March 9). At that time, all thumb movements were almost within normal limits and surgery scars were healed but the dexterity and strength were still lacking. In conversation with the patient on March 6, he reported that his wife began to show flu symptoms, fever, and mild cough. Two days later, he experienced a headache, constant leg pain, and fever (37.8°C). The next day fever increased (38.3°C) and the leg pain worsened over the next three days. He did not report any major respiratory symptoms. On March 10, he no longer had a fever, a mild cough remained, but he noted the loss of the smell and taste that persisted even when other symptoms resolved. The diagnosis of probable COVID-19 infection was made on clinical ground given the symptoms in the patient and his wife. Also later on May 16th a serological test for the detection of IgG/IgM resulted positive for IgG, thus confirming the patient's exposure to the disease. We continued physiotherapy through telerehabilitation 1 week after the symptoms resolved. We used noncommercial, publicly available software for audio and

video conferencing. Total of eight remote sessions was performed over 4 weeks, each lasting 1 hour. The first online evaluation of strength and dexterity in the hands and legs revealed no apparent deterioration (Thumb Opposition Test remained at seven and strength exercises were performed as before). Formal testing could not be done because no instruments (dexterity test, dynamometer) were available at home. The therapy was conducted under the guidance of a physiotherapist who instructed the patient to perform already learned and new exercises that were demonstrated through a video link. As the dexterity exercises, activities of daily living were used including tying shoelaces or cutting with a pair of scissors. Every week, the patient was asked to perform Thumb Opposition Test, exercises to infer the hand strength, and developed ad-hoc timed dexterity tests, such as tying shoelaces. Although not validated, these assessments along with patient observations were useful for monitoring the progress. Treatment is still ongoing, the patient is treated remotely twice a week and he will finish the physiotherapy at 16 sessions. Then, we will provide him with a link video of maintenance exercises. As soon as the COVID-19 emergency will be over, he will be assessed in our outpatient for hereditary neuropathies.
This suspected and probable COVID-19 infection in our patient affected by CMT1X did not cause any appreciable deterioration in the neuromuscular ability or worsening of the neuropathic deficits. Indeed, it is likely that more aggressive forms of COVID-19 disease may have more severe consequences, particularly in the CMT cases with pronounced neuromuscular impairments. Also, some patients with the CMT disease 1A may have a phrenic nerve neuropathy and already impaired respiratory functions (Sagliocco et al., 2003; Spiesshoefer et al., 2019). In such cases, the SARS-Cov-2 infection may have much worse outcomes. Telerehabilitation is currently an emerging and growing field (Parmanto and Saptono, 2009). Until now, the goals have been to reduce the costs (Anderson et al., 2000), improve the quality of life of patients (Linder et al., 2013; Hsieh et al., 2018), and develop new technologies for patient evaluation and the management (Kvedar et al., 2014). This case report demonstrates that remotely supervised home rehabilitation could be a solution when patients must be isolated, whether for infection or other condition, allowing continued rehabilitation despite social confinement.

Telerehabilitation offers an opportunity for the future development of novel `at home strategies' that can be performed alone or under guidance. Moreover, it would be useful to develop tools for evaluation at home. These should be simple to use and easy to connect to a remote system capable of rapidly transferring data to rehabilitation professionals.

Abstract
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), remaining a global health crisis since its outbreak until now. Advanced biotechnology and research findings have revealed many suitable viral and host targets for a wide range of therapeutic strategies. The emerging ribonucleic acid therapy can modulate gene expression by post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) based on Watson-Crick base pairing. RNA therapies, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), ribozymes, RNA interference (RNAi), aptamers, etc., were used to treat SARS-CoV whose genome is similar to SARV-CoV-2, and the past experience also applies for the treatment of COVID-19. Several studies against SARS-CoV-2 based on RNA therapeutic strategy have been reported, and a dozen of relevant preclinical or clinical trials are in process globally. RNA therapy has been a very active and important part of COVID-19 treatment. In this review, we focus on the progress of ribonucleic acid therapeutic strategies development and application, discuss corresponding problems and challenges, and suggest new strategies and solutions.

Introduction
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a new form of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), namely SARS-CoV-2 [1, 2]. As known so far, the SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster but is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, which affected more than 8000 individuals all over the world with a fatality rate of 11% in 2002-2004 [3, 4]. Among those affected patients, the failure of lung or related cardiovascular system contributed to a large share of the death. An excessive pro-inflammatory response mediated by elevated inflammatory cytokines and chemokines can lead to lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In addition, viral infection can cause a series of clinical symptoms, such as neurological complications, coagulation disorders, liver and kidney failures as well [5, 6]. Since the World

Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic, as of January 31, 2022, 373,229,380 confirmed cases, including 5,658,702 deaths, have been reported [7, 8]. Another disturbing concern is the variability of SARS-CoV-2. From the Alpha variant to the latest Omicron variant, the pathogenicity and transmissibility of the virus are qualitatively changed compared with the original strain, adding to the complexity of and difficulty in the pandemic prevention and treatment [9, 10]. To keep COVID-19 at bay, scientists have developed various vaccines to enhance immunity, and accelerated the development of therapeutic drugs, including small molecule and antibody drugs [11-14]. Among them, ribonucleic acid therapeutic strategies, which saw rapidly development in the past few years, seem to be most potential in treating COVID-19.

RNA Therapy
The classic central dogma of molecular biology believes that RNA is the transmitter of genetic information between DNA and proteins [15], and the discovery of catalytic RNA in the 1980s expanded the functions of RNA [16]. The Human Genome Project (HGP) and the progress in high-throughput sequencing technology dug up further information on the human genome, especially the gradual identification of the functions of a range of noncoding RNAs, completely changing researchers' perception of the RNA world [17]. It is now believed that RNA regulates the genes' functions in all living cells, and is closely related to many diseases [18]. In the 1990s, after the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) [19], RNA-based biotherapeutics came into being. Researchers tried to control gene expression permanently or temporarily by transporting nucleic acids into cells so as to treat the diseases. Thus, the era of RNA therapy has begun.
Under most circumstances, RNA therapies can be classified into several categories, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) which inhibit the translation of mRNA, RNAi, aptamers that could bind proteins and other molecular ligands, small activating RNAs (saRNAs) with the ability to activate genes, catalytic RNAs or called ribozymes, RNA vaccines and gene editing approaches such as CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) systems [20]. RNA based biotherapeutics have natural advantages over the traditional treatments. Since most RNA therapeutic drugs depend on the principles of Watson-Crick base pairing, it can specifically and closely complement and bind to the target to serve the

purpose of treatment [21, 22]. Besides, the therapeutic RNAs can be designed to suppress any genes, regardless of whether they are noncoding or highly expressed, and thus have the potential to treat a range of diseases theoretically. What's more, RNA can be synthesized through chemical methods, which is more cost-effective and convenient than other biologics. Therefore, RNA therapeutic drugs have significant potential in application because of their high efficacy, specificity and wide range of application [20].
Over the past two decades, a dozen of RNA therapeutic drugs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The specific list can be found in Table 1. Fomivirsen (trade name: Vitravene) is the first antisense oligonucleotide drug approved for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis complicated by AIDS patients [23]. Antiviral effects are exerted by antisense inhibition of CMV mRNA [24]. On August 10, 2018, the world's first small interfering RNA (siRNA) drug Patisiran (trade name: Onpattro) was approved by FDA. It is used to treat hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis and acute hepatic porphyria (AHP), as the first RNAi based drug in the world [25]. In 2021, faced with the growing threat from the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA approved two mRNA vaccines developed respectively by the companies of Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna [26, 27]. So far, over 400 RNA-targeting drug development projects have been conducted worldwide, two-thirds of which are in the pre-investigational new drug (pre-IND) stage, one-third in early clinical trials (phase I or II), about 3% in phase III, and some waiting regulatory approval. As most of the RNA drugs deliver a good performance, such as Patisiran with sales over $150 million in 2019, the world's major pharmaceutical

companies have made heavy investment in RNA therapeutic drugs to accelerate their development [28].
Viral infection is a common clinical disease [41], and can be a serious threat to human health as some viruses spread rapidly and have a high fatality rate. Today, there are two major interventions for viral infection: one is vaccines, the other is antiviral drugs to control clinical symptoms and reduce viral activity [42, 43]. However, the slow development of vaccines and the lack of specificity for most antiviral drugs make it more than urgent to find new antiviral strategies. The RNA therapeutic drugs may provide us with the answer [44]. Taking RNAi as an example, it can silence or suppress the expression of genes related to viral replication or some other important biological functions to fight against viral infection. Many researches on RNA therapy against viral infection are going on, including hepatitis B (HBV) [45], AIDS (HIV) [46] and hand-foot-and-mouth disease related virus [47], etc. In the detection and treatment of coronavirus infection, including SARS-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 raging around the world over the past two years, several studies on RNA therapy have been reported [48, 49]. Those in vitro and clinical trials show that RNA therapeutic strategies can successfully inhibit the replication of the viruses, thus become the most potential useful tool in controlling COVID-19 [50].
With great progress in RNA therapy, it still has some limitations in practice. Due to its poor stability, RNA can be easily degraded in organisms by ribonuclease (RNase), making the biological half-life too short. The low efficiency of cellular uptake makes it difficult for the drugs to get into the target cells [20]. Besides, RNA itself is potentially immunogenic and likely to have off-target effects [51, 52]. Efforts to improve the features of natural nucleic acids and develop them into useful drugs are diminished by these factors. To overcome these shortages, various chemical modifications and novel delivery systems have been designed to make RNA drugs more accurate. RNA therapy is a rapidly developing field and has significant potential in fighting against SARS-CoV-2. This review, with a focus on the development and application of ribonucleic acid therapeutic strategies for COVID-19, addresses its problems and challenges along its progress, and puts forward some feasible strategies and solutions.
Potential Targets for RNA Therapy against COVID-19
Though being theoretically feasible for RNA therapy to silence or suppress any protein, it is

5072
essential to select effective targets for the efficacy of the treatment. In general, there are two antiviral targeting strategies: (i) viral proteins essential in survival and replication, and (ii) related host factors including those involved in cellular entry and trafficking of the virus [51]. As shown in Figure 1, RNA therapeutic drugs against COVID-19 can also use the two potential different categories of targets.
Viral targets
Targeting viral proteins is a direct and effective approach. SARS-CoV-2 has a positive-sense, singlestranded RNA genome, which contains three different categories of genes: structural, nonstructural and accessory [2]. There are 4 structural genes including S, E, M, and N, encoding Spike, Envelope, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid protein respectively [53]. Among them, S-glycoprotein plays a major role in cell entry via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and so receives the most attention. S protein, with two subunits S1 and S2, determines the viral entry. S1 could directly contact with the host receptor ACE2 with its receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the fusion and entrance of the following membrane to the host cytoplasm of the viruses were mediated by S2 subunit [54-58]. Now S protein is the target mostly concerned about for various therapeutic approaches including RNA therapy [12]. Other structure proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the M protein plays a central role in viral morphogenesis, assembly and egress [12]. Further studies show that the domains formed by the N- and C-terminal of M protein may be the potential RNAi targets [59, 60]. The E protein, critical for viral envelope curvature, maturation, and budding, is also involved in ion channel activity that is required for pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and possibly SARSCoV-2 [4]. In a study on mutations among 68 samples of SARS-CoV-2, 42 missense mutations in a majority of structural and nonstructural proteins were identified, but the mutations in the E protein were not[61], indicating that the conserved E protein may serve as a great viral target for RNA therapy. N protein, another viral structural protein, is incorporated into nucleocapsid and responsible for viral genome packing. As its domains can bind to RNA via its phosphorylated residues, the N protein may also be a suitable target [62].
The nonstructural gene ORF1ab encodes polypeptides pp1a and pp1ab (-1 ribosomal frameshift) which occupies about 2/3 of the genome at the 5 end. Hydrolytic cleavage of pp1a and pp1ab produces a series of nonstructural protein (i.e., nsp1-16) that are essential for viral transcription and replication [53]. The productions of accessory genes, although not essential for viral structure or

replication, could modulate host innate or adaptive immune response and play a crucial role in viral pathogenicity [63]. In theory, all proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are potential anti-virus targets for developing ribonucleic acid therapy strategies against COVID-19.
The untranslated region (UTR) is another important part on the genome of SARS-CoV-2. Several studies show that the 5'UTR and the 3'UTR are also of great significance in the RNA replication and transcription of virus [64]. The researcher found in an early study that the small interfering RNA (siRNA) which targeted to the 3`UTR of SARS-CoV could suppress the viral infection and replication in Vero E6 cells [65]. Another study showed that the therapeutic siRNA which directly targeted the leader sequence of SARS could also inhibit the viral replication in Vero E6 cells [66], suggesting that the UTR of SARS may serve as a potential target of RNAi. Since the secondary structures of the 5`UTR of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are remarkably alike [64], these specific region sequences can also be the target for the treatment of COVID-19 using RNA therapeutics.
Host targets
As various interactions between the virus and the host proteins can be identified, host targeting is another strategy in antiviral therapy [67-70]. The viral infection and replication can be suppressed by blocking or inhibiting the key host factors. The ACE2, serving as the receptor of viral S protein, can facilitate the internalization of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [71]. It has been shown that soluble ACE2 has a protective role in many organs including lungs, making the recombinant ACE2 seem as a suitable therapeutic strategy [72]. Subsequent studies pointed out that ACE2 had a paradoxical role in protecting organs and facilitating the viral internalization [73]. Thus, further research and discussions on the benefits and potential risks of targeting ACE2 as a therapeutic strategy in COVID-19 are needed [73].
The components of the endocytic pathway have been proposed as crucial targets for developing the therapeutic strategies for all CoV species [74], for the endocytic pathway is thought to be important in viral entry and replication. Chloroquine, with its ability to neutralize lysosomal pH and inhibit protease activity, was extensively used in SARS-CoV [75, 76]. It is also reported that Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could suppress the viral entry into cells by interfering with the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with cell surface gangliosides [77]. However, the following study manifested that no significant difference was found in the outcome of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine, making this idea remain controversial

5073
[78]. A recent study showed that AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) seemed to be a suitable target to interrupt the viral entry into host cells and its intracellular assembly [79, 80]. There are dozens of medically approved AAK1 inhibitors. Among these drugs, Baricitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, which can bind to cyclin-G-associated kinase along with AAK1 to prevent the entrance of virus into cells and will not cause severe side effects even with higher doses, may be the most potential treatment against COVID-19 [81]. Another study found that AP2M1 as a crucial host factor in the infection of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The specific siRNA, namely siAP2M, was used to knock down the AP2M1 protein involved in endocytosis and significantly suppressed the viral infection [82]. These studies demonstrate that the therapeutic strategy of inhibiting the key host factors in endocytosis is feasible.
Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASO)
The antisense therapeutics was proposed in the 1970s with the theoretical basis that gene expression could be modulated by nucleic acids [83]. The chemically synthesized 15-50 nucleotides in length are designed to bind to RNA targets via complementary base pairing for the prevention of mRNA transcription and translation. Transported into cells, ASO combines with the target mRNA, and RNA-DNA complex becomes a substrate for RNase H, leading to endonuclease-mediated transcript knockdown [84]. ASO can also directly target mRNA, inhibiting mRNA from 5 capping, 3 polyadenylation, and splicing, ultimately terminating protein production [84]. ASO therapy is considered to be one of the most effective nucleic acid therapeutic strategies for many diseases, including myopathies, neurodegenerative diseases, oncology, etc.[85-87]. Given the advantage of targeting any viral RNA of interest, ASO has already been applied in some highly pathogenic viral infections of Ribovirus, such as Ebola, influenza, Hepatite-C, Japanese Encephalitis, achieving certain efficacy [88-91]. It is also an early nucleic acid therapy with successful clinical application for its more potential action mechanisms, easier intracellular delivery, and stable clinical suitability. Fomivirsen (trade name: Vitravene), the first ASO drug, was approved by FDA in 1998 [24]. After that, 9 ASO drugs were approved (Table 1), and 50 more ASO candidates are in clinical trials [28, 92].
Studies on ASO antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV boomed following the SARS outbreak in 2003. ASO technologies have been advanced to reduce the severity of viral infection, and to diagnose and treat SARS-associated disease. Three ASO-related patents were published. Patent US20030224353

Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2022, Vol. 18
published by Stein David described ASO ORF1 which targeted region 217-245bp of SARS-CoV, to treat the ssRNA viral infection [93]. Patent WO2005013905 was filed by AVI BioPharma, Inc., which targeted 3 terminal end of negative strand using the modified oligonucleotide compounds to treat ssRNA viral infection, including flavivirus, coronavirus, picornavirus, togavirus, calicivirus, and hepatitis E virus [94]. Ionis Pharmaceuticals designed hybrid DNA/RNA ASO for the disruption of the pseudoknot in the frameshift site of SARS-CoV to reduce the viral activity. Based on this ASO, Ionis Pharmaceuticals published the patent application WO2005023083 [95]. In addition to the patents, another study on ASO to target the conserved RNA elements that were required in the synthesis and translation of viral RNA, demonstrated that ASO could effectively inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV [96]. However, there appeared some unexpected results that SARS-CoV developed ASO drug resistance and escaped. Therefore, more rationality and caution are needed in designing ASO drugs for coronavirus.
Since the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share 79.5% similarity in genome [80], ASO should also be capable of treating COVID-19 on a theoretical level.

5074
ASO drug can be designed to bind to the viral mRNA transcripts that encode the crucial proteins associated with the replication and transcription to disturb the viral expansion. Based on this hypothesis, in a recent study, nine ASO candidates were designed to target the genes of viral structure protein N and ORF1a, ORF1b and 5-UTR of viral genome, of which were very important for the transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2. The results showed that viral infection could be inhibited by blocking these key targets effectively, which needs further verifications [97]. Beyond targeting the important viral protein synthesis, another strategy is to directly target the viral genome itself, especially RNA viruses (other than retroviruses). ASO can be designed to target the conserved sequences in viral genome to disturb or completely degrade the genomic RNA for the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 [52]. However, more studies are needed due to the unexpected variability of RNA viruses, and the difficulty to find suitable conserved sequences of viral genome for ASO targeting. All in all, with its simplicity to design, low toxicity effect, high specificity, and low production cost, ASO therapy is still a very potential treatment for COVID-19 [98].

Ribozymes
The discovery of catalytic RNA has dramatically complemented and improved the understanding of RNA in the 1980s. Catalytic RNA, also known as Ribozymes, can bind and cleave phosphodiester in nucleic acid to induce specific degradation of target mRNA for the inhibition of gene expression [99]. Being natural but also able to chemically synthesized, ribozymes are believed to treat viral infectious diseases effectively for its gene editing activities. Meanwhile, more efforts are needed in the design of ribozymes. The target region is required to be quite conserved and critical for the survival or replication of the virus, and accessible so that the ribozymes can bind to it easily and smoothly [99]. With its weak RNase resistance, Ribozymes often perform a short-term effect in vivo [100, 101]. Therefore, chemical modification and appropriate delivery system are always added to increase therapy robustness. Another concern is that the cleavage effects in vivo are often different from those in vitro [102]. Despite these disadvantages, ribozymes are still regarded as an important and effective antiviral therapy. Compared with some other RNA drugs, ribozymes have high specificity and low immunogenicity [103]. Ribozyme-based studies have already been carried out in a series of RNA viruses including HCV, HIV, and influenza [104-107], but few reports about the ribozyme therapy on coronavirus-induced diseases. This may be caused by the fact that ribozymes require for the conserved regions of the genome and the coronavirus families are prone to new mutations, making the design relatively difficult. In addition, in the last two decades, except for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused small-scale viral infections in certain areas, coronaviruses did not cause large-scale epidemics until the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. In an early study, a therapeutic RNA/DNA chimeric ribozyme was designed to recognize and cleave the conserved common regions and regions with loop structures in genome of coronavirus, including SARS, and a patent application was applied in this research (JP2007043942)[108]. As the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share highly similar genome [80], this designed chimeric ribozyme may also be potentially useful for COVID-19's treatment and related studies.
In recent years, gene-editing technology represented by CRISPR/Cas system is on a rise. Some studies have tried to use gene therapy technologies in combination with ribozymes to modulate gene expression so as to treat some intractable diseases. Ribozymes in conjunction with Cas9, or even Cpf1 nuclease are believed to improve the efficiency of

5075
treatment strategies [109]. CRISPR-RGP, a gene-editing system based on Streptococcus pyogenes (Sp) Cas9, was designed against Plasmodium. A ribozyme-guide-ribozyme (RGR) single guide RNA (sgRNA) expression strategy with RNA polymerase II promoters were utilized in the system, and a position-dependent but strand-independent reduction in gene expression was induced by the catalytically dead SpCas9 (dSpCas9) binding to the upstream region of target genes. This robust gene-editing system can be used in the treatment of malaria by generating gene disruptions and insertions of coding sequences in Plasmodium [110]. Similar studies with other gene therapy technologies on HIV have been carried out [111]. Therefore, gene editing or gene therapy combined with ribozymes provides a possibility to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.
RNA Interference (RNAi)
RNA interference (RNAi), the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) phenomenon, is induced by double strand RNA (dsRNA) which could efficiently and specifically degrade the homologous mRNAs [19]. RNAi is an inherent habitant of living organisms, which can be triggered by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or dsRNA. The classical process of RNAi is shown in Figure 2. In the cytoplasm, the long pieces of dsRNA are firstly cleaved into siRNA (21-23 nt in length) fragments by the enzyme Dicer [112]. Unlike ribozymes or ASOs that directly bind to target RNA, siRNA is combined with the protein Argonaute (Ago) and forms a complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [113]. With siRNA being unwound, the activated RISC complex containing the antisense strand (or guide strand) of siRNA will specifically target and degrade the complementary mRNA [114]. Two methods are used to artificially induce RNAi using siRNA strategy: directly delivering the designed siRNA into target cells via appropriate transporters, or using designed plasmids encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA). When the plasmid is sent into target cells, shRNA is produced and cleaved by Drosha and DGCR8 in the nucleus. After transferring into the cytoplasm by exportin 5, shRNA can be cleaved by enzyme Dicer and turn into siRNAs to induce RNAi [115]. Since siRNA can suppress gene expression by the RISC mechanism, target genes will see continuous degradation, resulting in extremely high potency and sustained activities compared with other RNA therapies. RNAi requires extremely strict recognition to degrade specific sequences, making its specificity highly unparalleled. In addition, small doses of siRNA could trigger sustained gene inhibition, and the effect increase with its

concentration level [115]. Based on these advantages of gene modulation, RNAi technology has been widely used to explore gene function and in the treatment of infectious diseases and malignant tumors [116-120]. Currently, there are four siRNA-based drugs approved (Table 1) [25, 37, 39, 121], and more than 20 candidates in clinical trials [28].
Past experience of RNAi against SARS-CoV
RNAi technology was applied in the previous treatment research for the SARS epidemic. SARS-CoV could enter human cells through the S protein binding to the host receptor ACE2, which is similar to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, S protein has become an important target selection in RNAi therapy. Several studies demonstrated that the viral load can be

5076
effectively reduced by silencing the S protein using siRNA strategy [65, 122, 123]. N protein incorporated into nucleocapsid and responsible for viral genome packing is also considered as a viral suppressor of RNAi in host cells [124]. The studies of targeting gene encoding N protein using shRNA approach were also carried out, with effective reduction in viral loads [125-127]. An interesting finding in the studies is that inhibition of N-gene could lead to an increase in the secretion of INF-, which also can help cells to fight viral infection. Apart from S and N protein, another structure protein M of SARS-CoV is also explored. A former study concluded that targeting the 3` portion of gene encoding M protein could effectively cut the target mRNA levels, but left the inhibition of SARS-CoV uninvestigated [128].

Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2022, Vol. 18
In addition to structural genes, genes encoding nonstructural proteins and accessory proteins and the UTR regions are also important targets of RNAi therapy. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene was highly conserved in different coronaviruses and considered to be an effective target [129]. Studies using siRNA and shRNA showed effective silencing of gene encoding RdRp[130-132]. However, the RdRp gene appeared to have different sensitivity to different siRNA sequences, which required more caution and rationality in the design of siRNA. In a separate study, shRNA was designed to target a leader sequence thought to be conserved in all coronaviruses, and a reduction in the viral load was observed [133]. Another study focused on nsp1, a non-structural protein of SARS-CoV which was derived from the 5 leader end of the genome. The cells transfected with the designed shRNA can resist the viral invasion and enjoy adequate protection [134]. The subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs), which are generated from discontinuous transcription during the synthesis of negative-strand genomic RNA of coronavirus, are also of great importance. The translation of most viral genes (the structural and accessory proteins) occurs via sgRNAs as the intermediates [135]. In a past study, several accessory proteins derived from the sgRNAs of SARS-CoV were considered to have no significant sequence homology compared with other coronaviruses. The previous experiments demonstrated that these proteins were suitable and effective targets as well as the S protein [136].
RNAi therapy against SARS-CoV-2
Since the SARS-CoV-2 is 79% similar to the SARS-CoV in genome, theoretically, RNAi strategies for SARS should be effective in treating COVID-19 as well [137]. siRNA can be designed to target the structural genes including S, E, M and N proteins to inhibit the entrance of virus into host cells and disturb the viral replication [138]. Besides the structural genes, the leader sequence seems to be another suitable choice [133]. The experience of SARS-related research can assist the development of therapeutic siRNA targeting leader sequences to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2. In a recent study, eight siRNAs targeting the highly conserved 5`-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 were designed. siCOV6, the most promising candidate, could reduce the viral replication and prevent cytopathic effect from developing by targeting the leader sequence that was present in all sgRNAs [139]. Targeting Nsps is another important strategy for the effective inhibition of viral replication in reducing the viral symptoms [134]. There are totally 15 nsps, nsp1 to nsp10 and nsp12 to

5077
nsp16, which are encoded by genes on ORF1ab and ORF1a in the genome of SARS-CoV-2. Nsp12 is the RdRp of the virus and can co-regulate the viral replication with nsp5 (3C-like protease) [138]. Several previous studies showed the effective suppression of SARS-CoV by using siRNA to target RdRp gene, and this strategy may also be feasible for SARS-CoV-2. In a recent study, nsp9 and nsp10 were found to interact with NF-B-repressing factor (NKFR) to facilitate interleukin-8 (IL-8) induction in lung epithelial A549 cells. The designed siRNAs were used to target these two nsps, and the introduction of IL-8 was observed to decrease effectively, which could help to reduce the level of inflammation and minimize damages to the lung [69].
The design of RNAi using computational approaches
In the past decade, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence and the continuous accumulation of biological data, computer technology plays an increasingly important role in drug design. Compared with traditional method of small molecule drug screening, the computational algorithms represented by deep learning can remarkably shorten the development time and cut the cost. In research to fight SARS-CoV-2, due to the time-consuming experimental methods, computational approaches can focus on thousands of solutions simultaneously, and effectively narrow down the cases for experimental validation. Several studies on the RNAi therapy against COVID-19 through the computational methods were reported (Seen in Supplementary Table 1). In one research project, genes encoding nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 were chosen as the targets, and 8 siRNA molecules selected from 78 candidates were predicted to effectively silence the target genes for the antiviral treatment [140]. Nucleocapsid is encoded by N gene and responsible for viral encapsidation and genome packing. In one attempt, several bioinformatic tools were applied for the design of a duplex siRNA molecule that did not fit any off-target sequences. The results demonstrated that it could effectively silence the N gene, with therapeutic potential for SARS-CoV-2 [141]. In another study, the online software siDirect version 2.0 was used to predict the highly effective siRNAs taking the leader sequence of viral genome as the target, and the HNADOCK online server was applied in molecular docking to validate siRNA affinity for the targets. Four potential siRNAs were revealed in the results. Among them, the siRNA with sequence 5'GUUUAGAGAACAGAUCUAC AA3' possesses the greatest potential to inhibit the leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with least off-target

Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2022, Vol. 18
effect [48]. ORF1ab, the largest gene in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, encodes polyprotein PP1ab and PP1a which are the key factors in viral transcription and replication. In a separate study, some bioinformatic approaches were used to predict the potential siRNA by screening siRNA library targeting the ORF1ab gene. In the results, a total of 10 siRNA candidates were sorted out as the potential therapeutic agents against COVID-19 [142]. With RdRp as another important potential target for RNAi therapy, a dozen of siRNAs were designed to silence RdRp gene to cure COVID-19 in a recent study. Out of the expectation, the target of designed siRNA revealed no significantly matches with the entire human genome, which excludes any possibility for off-target silencing of the siRNA [49]. In addition to these structural or non-structural genes, the viral genome can also be targeted by siRNA. In one attempt, siRNAs were designed to directly target the evolutionarily conserved regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome to down-regulate or silence its RNA. These siRNA candidates which had high affinity and low side effects were considered to be the potential therapeutics [143].

Industry applications on RNAi therapy against coronavirus
Since the SARS epidemic, dozens of patents for RNA-based therapeutic strategies have been issued. Most of them are based on RNAi therapy, and some are treated with antisense RNA. The review of siRNA-based patents issued or under consideration for coronaviruses is shown in Table 2. Due to the limited number of infected patients and areas of SARS and MERS, and the fact that similar viral infection incidents did not occur after the end of the epidemic in a short run, these treatment patents for coronaviruses were rarely developed into drugs or therapeutic strategies [4]. As a result, after the outbreak of COVID-19, there is still no specific cure for SRAS-CoV-2. However, with the advantages of RNAi technology in treating viral diseases and the research experience of RNA therapy against SARS-CoV, some pharmaceutical companies have published their recent research achievements. Hundreds of siRNAs have been designed to target the highly conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 or the key factors that are responsible for the viral transcription or replication together with the delivery systems. With the ongoing epidemic of COVID-19, these siRNAs could eventually be developed into specific drugs for clinical application.

Other RNA Therapy
Aptamer
Aptamers, single-stranded RNA or DNA molecules, can fold and form stable three-dimensional structures by complementary base pairing, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding, and bind to target proteins with high specificity to modulate the functions [144-146]. Although most of aptamers are based on DNA molecules, for the significant advantages of high affinity, facile chemical modification, low-cost, low-temperature sensitivity, rapid synthesis, and large-scale production, RNA aptamers have also been widely used, especially in some antiviral studies[147-149]. In this review, we focused on the RNA aptamers against coronavirus infection. Nowadays, aptamers are often combined with other therapeutic agents, such as siRNA and ribozymes [145]. In a recent study, siRNA technology combined with aptamers have been applied to suppress HIV-1 expression [150]. Researches on aptamers against SARS-CoV have also been reported. In two Korea patent applications (KR2009128837 and KR2012139512), aptamer technology was used to inhibit the SARS virus, which all provide a new RNA therapeutic strategy for the fight against SARS-CoV-2 [108].
Aptamers also have a wide application in diagnosis for their high affinity to bind to target proteins. During the SARS epidemic, aptamer technology was proved to be useful in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV. By targeting antigenic viral proteins, aptamers were also considered promising in the diagnosis of COVID-19 [151, 152]. On this subject, several studies have stated that the aptamer technology combined with the enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay to diagnose COVID-19 disease are being developed by Aptamer Group [153, 154]. Pinpoint Science has proposed a new approach for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 by an aptamer-based nanosensor [155]. With the progress in aptamer technology, a future where COVID-19 can be diagnosed at speed and with accuracy is foreseeable.
Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs)
PNA is a specific kind of antisense therapy, in which N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine units has replaced the nucleic acid phosphodiester backbone via a methyl carbonyl binder [156]. Similar to ASO, PNAs can specifically bind to target DNA or RNA according to Watson-Crick base pairing to modulate gene expression [157]. PNAs can exist stably in vivo or in vitro as the result of the resistance to nucleases or proteases, and have low toxicity due to low or no binding affinity to serum proteins [158], making them

5079
important candidates for antisense therapeutics. In some earlier anti-HIV studies, PNAs molecules were designed to target certain regions, including gag gene, dimerization initiation site and att sequences of linear pro-viral DNA's U3 and U5 region. The results demonstrated that PNAs could effectively inhibit the reverse transcription and prevent the integration of the viral genome and the host genome, showing a great antiviral effect [159-161].
The studies on PNAs against coronaviruses is limited. -1 Ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) hardly occurs during translation naturally. However, it can be triggered by specific signals which increases the possibility of tRNA slippage up to 50% [162]. The RPF signal consists of two elements, a heptanucleotide slippery site and a downstream tertiary RNA structure in the form of an RNA pseudoknot. SARS-CoV initiates -1 RPF at the three-helix-containing RNA pseudoknot [163]. The control of -1 PRF efficiency has been shown to be critical for the maintenance of correct stoichiometric ratios of viral replicase proteins [164]. In a previous study, a fully compatible sequence-specific PNA was designed to block the -1 PRF signal which was in charge of the synthesis of viral RNA replicase polyproteins, and the viral replication was significantly inhibited [165]. Since the structure of the -1 PRF signal is extremely conserved and stable, the result is also helpful for the design of PNAs against COVID-19. Another problem affecting the PNAs strategy for the treatment is the slow cellular uptake of PNAs [157]. Therefore, necessary modifications or appropriate delivery system such as nanotechnological tools should have been applied in the design of PNAs.
mRNA encoding therapeutic antibodies
Neutralizing antibodies are important biological products against various infectious viral pathogen. Compared with the traditional production and purification processes of therapeutic antibodies, delivering the genetic information of the antibody including DNA or mRNA to produce biologicals in situ is a cost- and labor-effective manner and a new antiviral option [166]. In early attempts, naked plasmid DNA (pDNA) was injected into the quadriceps of mice and the local expression of the encoded proteins was observed [167]. However, considering the potential integration of the pDNA into the host genome and the fear of anti-DNA autoantibodies, there is no pDNA-based drug been marketed so far even if several pDNA-encoded antibodies were evaluated in phase II-III clinical trials. In recent years, with the progress of in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA technology, it has become
https://www.ijbs.com

Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2022, Vol. 18
possible to use engineered mRNA to generate therapeutic antibodies in vivo. IVT mRNA can efficiently induce protein expression, avoiding risks such as be integrated into the host genome. With the improvement of delivery systems, the stability and translatability of the engineered mRNA have also been greatly increased. mRNA therapeutics has been applied in several bio-medical fields including the therapeutic cancer vaccine [168, 169], prophylactic vaccine [170, 171] and different infectious diseases [172, 173].
In a study treating respiratory viral infections, the engineered mRNA encoding a bispecific single-domain antibody against the influenza A virus was constructed and delivered into lungs of mice before the viral infection. The reduced viral titers and morbidities in mice were observed [174]. In addition, mRNA therapeutic strategy has also been applied in the treatment against COVID-19. A safe and cost-effective platform to express neutralizing antibody in the lung with replicating mRNA using alphavirus replicon particle (VRP) delivery system is developed. The replicating mRNA encoding therapeutic antibody is intranasally delivered to target lung of mice. The experiment result shows that SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently be suppressed with reducing viral titer and less tissue damage [175]. Although there are still some concerns such as the intrinsic immunogenicity and transmission efficiency, a growing number of studies have shown that the local delivery of mRNA encoding therapeutic antibodies in the lungs could be a promising pulmonary antiviral prophylactic treatment [176].
CRISPR/Cas technology
CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) systems have greatly improved our ability to edit genes and modulate gene expression [177]. Except for its genome-editing ability, the diagnostic potential was also noticed by scientists. In 2017, Feng Zhang's group have reported SHERLOCK, the first CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection technique [178]. SHERLOCK allows multiplexed, portable, and ultra-sensitive detection of RNA and DNA from clinical samples. Recently, CRISPR/Cas technology has also been applied in the diagnosis of COVID-19. An assay design tool and a research method based on the CRISPR-Cas13 was designed. It was reported that the system could detect specifically SARS-CoV-2 and 66 related viruses in patient specimens [179].
In addition to the diagnosis, CRISPR/Cas technology has already been used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. PAC-MAN (prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells), based on CRISPR-Cas13

5080
technology, is found to effectively degrade the SARS-CoV-2 sequences in human lung epithelial cells. In this system, the CRISPR-derived RNAs (crRNAs) were designed and screened, and the crRNAs could target the conserved viral regions to cleave SARS-CoV-2 genome [180]. There are totally 22 crRNA pools analyzed by bioinformatics tools which can target all sequenced coronaviruses in PAC-MAN system in this study. Thus, PAC-MAN is a promising strategy to combat coronavirus by targeting different regions of a virus or different coronavirus strains simultaneously with the crRNA pool, preventing possible viral escapes [180].
Challenges and Perspectives
The right target selection is the first step in RNA therapy against COVID-19, whether ASOs or RNAi strategy. The targets should be conserved in the viral genome and very important for the life cycle of the virus. Similar to other treatments such as therapeutic antibodies, the structural genes of SARS-CoV-2 genome which encode S, E, M and N proteins, as well as crucial NSPs and accessory proteins are all potential therapeutic targets [12]. Among them, S protein with the function to help viruses enter cells by binding the host ACE2 receptor has attracted much more attention. Almost all RNA therapies have tried to target S protein to suppress the SARS-CoV-2 [55, 60, 123]. In addition, proteins responsible for the important viral physiological functions, such as transcription and replication, taking RdRp as an example, are often selected as therapeutic targets too [49]. One concern for the treatment is the variability of coronavirus. At present, dozens of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, posting serious challenges to its diagnosis and treatment [10]. Therefore, further in-depth research is needed to explore the conserved or specific functional regions suitable for therapeutic targeting in the viral genome by comparing the differences between variants. Another therapeutic strategy is the host targeting, such as targeting ACE2 receptors or some other key host factors in the process of viral transcription or replication [73]. However, the suppression of these host genes might cause different unexpected symptoms in humans. The design of RNA therapeutic strategy against host targets should be more cautious.
Another challenge is the stability of RNA-related drugs. It is well known that RNA has weak resistance to nucleases, and is rapidly metabolized in cells. These disadvantages have significantly limited the development of nucleic acid drugs. To solve these problems, several biological techniques, including chemical modifications to the RNA as well as drug delivery system, have been applied in drug design. A

https://www.ijbs.com

Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2022, Vol. 18
wide variety of chemical modifications, including modifications in nucleobase, backbone and sugar moiety, have been studied to improve the affinity and nuclease resistance of the RNA therapeutics [181-185]. The therapeutic efficacy of RNA drugs can be considerably enhanced by the chemical modifications through improving pharmacokinetic characteristics, making it a general and common approach for the design of nucleic acid strategy. In addition to the chemical modifications, the drug delivery system is another probable approach. Drug delivery system or the carrier technology can help drugs be taken up by cells more efficiently, reach the therapeutic targets more directly, enhance the targeting effect and biological activity, and prevent the drugs from being degraded by nucleases [186]. Liposomes, cationic polymer complexes, dendrimers, polymer microsomes, peptide protein delivery vehicles, and nanoparticles are all thought to be suitable choices of delivery systems [20]. Among them, nanostructure lipid carrier (NLC) is considered the most promising drug delivery system at present. Owing to the suitable volume, high drug loading efficiency and specific physical and chemical properties, the NLC system can improve the stability of nucleic acid drugs, complete drug delivery, release the drug effectively, and avoid the drug degradation in vivo. NLC technology has already been applied in Patisiran, the first approved siRNA-based drug [25]. Therapeutic siRNA is encapsulated in lipid-based nanoparticles to prevent the degradation by exonuclease while facilitating the transport process in vivo, which is also applicable to the development of nucleic acid drugs for coronaviruses. Because of the acute lung injury and inflammatory response caused by SARS-CoV-2, RNA therapeutic drugs cannot get through the barriers composed of the intense mucus layer, alveolar macrophages and pulmonary proteases [187]. Therefore, effective chemical modifications and drug delivery system such as NLC will boost the development of RNA therapeutic strategies against COVID-19.
How to deliver RNA therapeutic drugs to the lungs is another concern. Inhalational delivery, verified by accumulating evidence, is the optimal drug delivery approach compared to some conventional methods. Oral, nasal, and other inhalation delivery have several advantages, such as the ease of administration and the rapid onset of action, which is already used in some drugs and vaccines [188, 189]. In 2003, the live attenuated influenza vaccines in the form of nasal spray were approved in US for its better mucosal immune responses [190]. Inhalation delivery, or pulmonary delivery, is commonly applied in respiratory diseases.

5081
Drops, liquid sprays, powder sprays or gels are the main forms in the treatment. In recent years, nanoparticle formulations, with much garnered attention in the development of RNA therapy because of their ability to carry nucleic acid drugs, can also be used for inhalational delivery. In one RNAi study of lung cancer, therapeutic siRNA was encapsulated in liposomes and then delivered to lungs as spray freeze-dried nanoparticles for treatment [191]. Other studies on nanoparticle formulations for pulmonary delivery, such as dry powder chitosan nanoparticles and nanoparticles with the pulmonary surfactant Curosurf, showed that both can deliver therapeutic RNA molecules to lungs through inhalation [192, 193]. In a recent exploration, a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery system is developed and therapeutic siRNAs which are encapsulated in the LNPs are transported to lungs directly. By using LNP system, SARS-CoV-2 can be greatly inhibited by screened siRNAs which can target the highly conserved regions of the viral genome [50]. Another interesting finding was that siRNA formulated with the traditional polymeric carrier polyethyleneimine (PEI) appeared to have the same therapeutic effect as the siRNA without a carrier. The result suggested that inhalation approach might be able to maintain the activity of "free" siRNA molecules [194]. Therefore, inhalational approaches serve as a reliable delivery strategy of great significance in winning the battle against SARS-CoV-2 using a nanoparticle delivery system or the "free" therapeutic RNA molecules.
Still there are some pharmacodynamic-related challenges on RNA therapy, including off-target effects and potential immunotoxicity. Some biological technologies such as chemical modifications can hold the key to solutions. However, a more directed effort is required by experts and funding agencies to develop simple, cost-effective, and easy-to-use formulations of RNA therapeutics, to accelerate the clinical application of RNA-based antiviral drugs.
Conclusion
The outbreak of COVID-19, a particularly contagious respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has highlighted the urgent need for new therapeutic strategies that are rapid, precise, stable, and target-specific for treatment. In this review, we summarized the research experience of ribonucleic acid therapy strategies against SARS-CoV-2, including ASO, ribozymes, RNAi technology, aptamer, etc., and described different RNA therapeutics in terms of mechanisms, application methods, and shortages to improve. Besides, it paid special attention on the computational approaches in RNAi technology for COVID-19. RNA

therapeutic strategies in this review aimed at viral therapy for SARS-CoV-2, provide sufficient evidence of their potential. In the end, from the perspectives of the existing literature, available technical tools, a large number of relevant scientific studies and persistent clinical trials, it is believed that more novel RNA therapeutic drugs will emerge for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in the near future.
