age at COVID-19 diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.096, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.15) and parity (OR, 1.703, 95% CI, 1.13-2.57) were identified as significant risk factors of severe diseases. Among women who delivered, 78.5% underwent cesarean section. Preterm birth (38.5%), premature rupture of membranes (7.7%), and miscarriage (4.6%) occurred, but there was no stillbirth or neonatal death. The RT-PCR test of newborns' amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood samples was negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Conclusion: At the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, gestational age and parity of pregnant women were the risk factors of disease severity. Vertical transmission of COVID-19 was not observed, and maternal severity did not significantly affect the neonatal prognosis.

INTRODUCTION
The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) has created a major global health concern. At the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2, the World Health Organization designated pregnant women as a vulnerable group based on preliminary studies, which reported poor obstetric and neonatal outcomes of previous outbreaks of respiratory virus infections, including SARS,1,2 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),3,4 and influenza.5
The anatomical, physiological, and immunological changes that occur during normal pregnancy can have systematic effects, which make pregnant women more likely to develop complications from respiratory tract infections.6,7 However, the available data are insufficient and inconsistent to infer the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women in terms of obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Although critical illness was relatively uncommon in both groups, the maternal and obstetric outcomes appeared to be worse in pregnant women, compared with that in non-pregnant women with COVID-19.8,9 Pregnant women will not only develop a more severe form of COVID-19 but also experience pregnancy-related complications such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, and stillbirth.9-16 However, other studies reported that with COVID-19 pregnant women have less severe consequences than those with other coronavirus infections such as SARS or MERS.17 Furthermore, the severity of COVID-19 in pregnant women is similar to that in non-pregnant women.13,14,18-28
In the Republic of Korea (ROK), a previous nationwide study using claims data suggested that the prevalence of COVID-19 was lower in pregnant women (0.02%) than in nonpregnant women aged 20-44 years (0.14%) from January 2020 to February 2021. The medical insurance systems in the ROK that cover all Korean citizens include the National Health Insurance (97%) and the Medical Aid program (3%), which provide easy access to medical institutions. In the ROK, at the beginning of this pandemic, all pregnant women with COVID-19 were admitted in order to receive intensive and careful management. Data concerning the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women in Korea's differentiated healthcare environment is extremely scarce. This fundamental information is essential to assess the clinical benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women.
This study aimed to describe the maternal, neonatal, and obstetrical outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19; evaluate the possibility of vertical transmission; and investigate the predictors affecting the progression to severe diseases.

METHODS
Study design and population
This multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted in 15 hospitals located in the ROK from January 2020 to December 2021. The study population included women diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy and admitted to the hospital. COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive result on reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab or sputum specimen.
Each patient was classified using an 8-point COVID-19 ordinal scale developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.29 The study population was divided into two groups: those with mild diseases ( 4 points) and those with severe disease ( 5 points).
Primary and secondary outcomes
The primary outcomes of this study were to describe the maternal, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. Maternal outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) admission; oxygen supply including high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; renal replacement therapy; length of hospital stay; and mortality. Obstetric outcomes included preterm delivery and obstetric complications such as miscarriage, stillbirth, and premature rupture of membranes. Neonatal outcomes included vertical transmission, Apgar score, neonatal pneumonia, and death. The secondary outcome was to identify the risk factors associated with severe diseases in pregnant women.
Variables and data collection
The following data were retrieved from each hospital's electronic medical records: maternal age, body mass index (BMI), parity, admission routes, occupation, comorbidities, gestational age at the time of diagnosis, symptoms, oxygen support, gestational complications, obstetric complications, treatment of COVID-19, laboratory findings, co-infection, length of hospital stay, mortality, gestational age at the time of delivery, mode of delivery, result of neonate COVID-19 screening, Apgar score, and neonatal complication and death.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), while categorical variables were expressed as frequency rates and percentages. The KolmogorovSmirnov test was used to determine the normality of continuous variables. The means of continuous variables were compared using independent samples t-test for parametric methods and Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric methods. Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test was used to determine the normality of categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 in pregnant women. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Youden's index maximum principle were used to measure the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and determine the accuracy of the optimal cutoff value of all selected risk factors. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 23.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
Ethics statement
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Korea University Anam Hospital (IRB No. 2020AN0408). The requirement for obtaining informed consent was waived because of the retrospective nature of the study.

RESULTS

Demographic and clinical characteristics of pregnant women
A total of 257 pregnant women with COVID-19 were included in the study. The median age of the study population was 34 (IQR, 31-37) years, and 26 (10.12%) patients were aged  40 years (Table 1). Among 234 pregnant women whose parity was confirmed, 120 (51.3%) had given birth for the first time. The distribution of patients by gestational age was as follows: first trimester, 26.1%; second trimester, 33.1%; and third trimester, 40.9%. More pregnant women developed severe COVID-19 in the third trimester than those in the first or second trimester (Table 1). A total of 29 (11.3%) pregnant women had one or more underlying medical conditions. Nineteen (7.39%) pregnant women developed gestational complications (Table 1).

The most common symptom was cough (53.7%), followed by fever (48.3%), sore throat (37.0%), and sputum (30.7%) (Table 2). The severity of COVID-19 in pregnant women according to oxygen demand is presented in Table 2. The distribution of patients by clinical severity,

determined using the 8-point COVID-19 ordinal scale of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was as follows: 76.7% had mild disease (1 point [0%], 2 points [0%], 3 points [0%], and 4 points [100%]), while 23.3% had severe disease (5 points [75%], 6 points [21.7%], 7 points [3.3%], and 8 points [0%]). Oxygen therapy was not required in 197 (76.7%) pregnant women with COVID-19 (Table 2). On the contrary, 9 (3.5%) patients and 2 (0.78%) patients were admitted in the ICU and required mechanical ventilation, respectively. However, none of the pregnant women with COVID-19 died. With regard to the use of therapeutic agents, pregnant women received remdesivir and regdanvimab (Table 2).
Obstetric outcomes of pregnant women
Among 257 pregnant women with COVID-19, the obstetric outcomes of 65 patients were determined. Of these, 37 (56.9%) and 28 (43.1%) patients showed mild diseases ( 4 points) and severe diseases ( 5 points), respectively. The median gestational age at delivery was 38 (IQR, 36-39) weeks, and 25 (38.5%) patients had preterm birth (Table 3). Fifty-one (78.5%) pregnant women underwent cesarean delivery and especially, all pregnant women with severe COVID-19 underwent cesarean delivery (Table 3). Premature rupture of membranes (8.2%) and miscarriage (4.6%) occurred, but none of the patients experienced stillbirth (Table 3). The frequency of preterm birth ( 37 weeks) was higher in pregnant women with severe COVID-19 than in those with mild COVID-19 (Table 3).
Neonatal outcomes
As 3 pregnant women experienced miscarriage, only 62 neonates were included in this study. Among them, 28 (45.2%) neonates were born of pregnant women with severe illness (Table 4). Vertical transmission of COVID-19 did not occur in all neonates who were delivered from pregnant women with this illness (Table 4). Interestingly, the Apgar score of neonates born of patients with severe COVID-19 was significantly higher than that of neonates born of patients with mild COVID-19 (Table 4). All neonates survived.
Risk factors associated with severe COVID-19
In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the number of gestational age at COVID-19 diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.096, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.15) and parity (OR, 1.703, 95% CI, 1.13-2.57) were significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 (Table 5). Age, BMI, gestational age at the time of infection, parity, comorbidities, and gestational complications were included in the multivariate analysis adjusted for study center.
In addition, the ROC curve of gestational age was used to determine the optimal cutoff value for high-risk patients who are likely to progress to severe illness. The AUC of the ROC curve was 0.768 (95% CI, 0.711-0.826, P < 0.001). According to Youden's index maximum principle, the cutoff value was 21.5 weeks. The sensitivity and specificity of this cut-off value were 0.950 and 0.553, respectively.

DISCUSSION
Our study aimed to describe the maternal, obstetrical, and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19; evaluate the possibility of vertical transmission; and investigate the predictors affecting the progression to severe diseases. Pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 rarely progressed to severe COVID-19 or had poor obstetric outcomes. The possibility of vertical transmission as well as maternal or fetal mortality was not observed

Recent data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency showed 1 (3.27%) died and 73 (3.27%) developed severe COVID-19 among the 2,232 pregnant women with COVID-19 from January 2020 to December 2021.30 The fatality rate of pregnant women with COVID-19 was 0.04%, which was not different from that of non-pregnant women of reproductive age (20-45 years), although the incidence rate of critical illness in pregnant women (3.3%) was nine times higher than that in non-pregnant women at reproductive age (0.4%). Even in three other studies conducted in the ROK, pregnant women with COVID-19 were not at higher risk of developing a severe disease,26,27,31 which was similar to the results of previous studies conducted outside of the ROK.13,14,18-25,28
With regard to the use of therapeutic agents in pregnant women, remdesivir and corticosteroids were administered in 14.8% and 23.7%, respectively, and even those with mild diseases were prescribed these medications. The United States Food and Drug Administration assigned remdesivir and corticosteroids to pregnancy risk category B and C, respectively. Patients with severe cases included in our study were more likely to receive remdesivir or corticosteroids than those with mild cases. According to the COVID-19 treatment guidelines developed by the National Institutes of Health, the therapeutic management of pregnant patients with COVID-19 should be the same as that of nonpregnant patients.32 However, the benefit-risk balances in each single case should be considered when selecting a specific drug for the treatment of COVID-19 in pregnant patients.33
The preterm birth and cesarean section rates in the present study were relatively high (38.5% and 78.5%, respectively) compared with that (20.6-25.0% and 52.3-95.8%, respectively) in a previous systematic review.16 Preterm birth ( 37 weeks) and cesarean section were more frequent in pregnant women with severe disease than in those with mild diseases. The mode of delivery did not lead to the vertical transmission of COVID-19 or did not affect the neonatal outcomes.34-36 The selection of mode of delivery may have been based on the hospital infection control status and medical condition of pregnant women in addition to the previous history of cesarean delivery, failure of labor to progress, breech presentation, and premature rupture of membranes.34,37-39
Our study showed no evidence of vertical transmission in pregnant women with COVID-19. In the recent study, 1.8% of newborns of pregnant women with COVID-19 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-qPCR, and 1% experienced antenatal and intrapartum transmission.40 The study suggested that the severity of maternal COVID-19 seemed to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in neonates.40
In this study, the Apgar score was higher in newborns of mothers with severe illness compared with newborns of mothers with mild illness. However, the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores of most newborns were 7 to 10; hence, no further intervention was provided. Only 6 neonates had a 1-minute Apgar score of 5 or 6, and were equally distributed in the mild and severe groups. Furthermore, the incidence of transient tachypnea of newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, and neonatal pneumonia was not different between the two groups, and none of the neonates died. Based on the results of this study, the disease severity of pregnant women with COVID-19 did not affect the neonatal outcomes.
Our findings demonstrated that pregnant women with COVID-19 with a gestational age of  21.5 weeks and a history of childbirth were more likely to progress to severe COVID-19. In previous studies, the severity of COVID-19 in pregnant women at  20 weeks of gestation or

in the third trimester was higher than that of pregnant women who had not yet reached this gestational age.17,41,42 However, opinions regarding the differences in obstetric or neonatal outcomes according to gestational age remain controversial.43
This study has some limitations. First, although the data were collected from 15 hospitals, only some of the data from the study population were included in the analysis as a small sample size. Therefore, the interpretation of the results is limited, and our findings may have limited generalizability. Second, the severity of pregnant women with COVID-19 was possibly overestimated because the data were collected from a tertiary medical institution. Third, the vaccination status of pregnant women was not investigated in this study. However, COVID-19 vaccination was initiated in the ROK from October 18, 2020. Until December 2021, only 9.8% of pregnant women were vaccinated against COVID-19 in the ROK. Therefore, the maternal outcomes associated with COVID-19 vaccination did not significantly affect the results of this study. Finally, this study was conducted on patients with COVID-19 prior to the outbreak of omicron variant. The subjects included in our study are presumed to be mainly related to the wild type, the alpha variant, and delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Hence, our results were difficult to apply in those infected with omicron variants.
To the best of our knowledge, this multicenter cohort study was the first to investigate the maternal, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 according to disease severity in the ROK. In conclusion, the present study showed that outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of non-pregnant women, but they were at higher risk of progression to severe disease. In pregnant women with COVID-19, the probability of vertical transmission is extremely rare, but attention should be paid to the obstetrical complications according to severity of the patient's clinical condition. Hence, the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women should be clarified by conducting a nationwide prospective cohort study. These fundamental data will contribute to optimized allocation of scarce resources and formulation of rational healthcare policies to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.

Objective: To describe the experience of implementing a deep learning-based computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the interpretation of chest X-ray radiographs (CXR) of suspected coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients and investigate the diagnostic performance of CXR interpretation with CAD assistance. Materials and Methods: In this single-center retrospective study, initial CXR of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were investigated. A commercialized deep learning-based CAD system that can identify various abnormalities on CXR was implemented for the interpretation of CXR in daily practice. The diagnostic performance of radiologists with CAD assistance were evaluated based on two different reference standards: 1) real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) results for COVID-19 and 2) pulmonary abnormality suggesting pneumonia on chest CT. The turnaround times (TATs) of radiology reports for CXR and rRT-PCR results were also evaluated. Results: Among 332 patients (male:female, 173:159; mean age, 57 years) with available rRT-PCR results, 16 patients (4.8%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Using CXR, radiologists with CAD assistance identified rRT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients with sensitivity and specificity of 68.8% and 66.7%, respectively. Among 119 patients (male:female, 75:44; mean age, 69 years) with available chest CTs, radiologists assisted by CAD reported pneumonia on CXR with a sensitivity of 81.5% and a specificity of 72.3%. The TATs of CXR reports were significantly shorter than those of rRT-PCR results (median 51 vs. 507 minutes; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Radiologists with CAD assistance could identify patients with rRT-PCR-positive COVID-19 or pneumonia on CXR with a reasonably acceptable performance. In patients suspected with COVID-19, CXR had much faster TATs than rRT-PCRs. Keywords: Radiography, thoracic; COVID-19; COVID-19 diagnostic testing; Pneumonia; Deep learning

INTRODUCTION
The initial outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (1), originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Following this occurrence, the disease rapidly progressed into a pandemic, with more than 5.4 million confirmed patients and more than 340000 deaths

worldwide as of May 26, 2020 (2). Early identification of infected patients and adequate isolation of patients to interrupt human-to-human transmission is of utmost importance in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic (2).
The primary diagnostic method for COVID-19 is detection of SARS-CoV-2 via real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in respiratory specimens (3). Several recent studies have shown that CT may exhibit

Deep Learning for Chest X-Ray Radiograph in Suspected Coronavirus Disease Patients

findings of pneumonia in patients with initially negative rRT-PCR results (4-6) and can be considered as a screening tool for COVID-19 in epidemic areas. However, screening or early diagnosis using chest CT in patients suspected for COVID-19 may not be practical, owing to the risk of viral transmission during the examination, transportation of the patient, and difficulty with disinfecting the environment. Owing to this, chest CT is currently not recommended for screening or initial diagnosis of COVID-19 (7, 8).
Chest X-ray radiograph (CXR) is the primary imaging technique in the diagnosis of pneumonia because of its easy accessibility, low cost, low radiation exposure, and reasonable diagnostic capability (9, 10). Therefore, CXR using a portable radiography unit may be considered as a primary radiologic examination for COVID-19 because patient transportation can be minimized and disinfection is relatively easy (7). However, because of the intrinsic limitation of the two-dimensional projection image, where various anatomic or pathologic structures are overlapped, CXR have lower sensitivity compared to chest CTs (11, 12) and are prone to reading errors and inter- or intra-reader variability (13). Thus, a computer-aided detection (CAD) system that can accurately identify pulmonary opacities suggestive of pneumonia may help promptly and accurately diagnose pneumonia, such as that observed in COVID-19 patients (14). In this regard, we implemented a deep learning-based CAD system for the interpretation of CXR of patients who were suspected for COVID-19.
We aimed to describe our experience of implementing a deep learning-based CAD system for the interpretation of CXR of suspected COVID-19 patients, as well as to investigate the diagnostic performance of CXR for COVID-19 using the CAD system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This single-center, retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital, and the requirement for informed consent was waived.
Patients and CXR Acquisition We retrospectively included consecutive patients using
the following criteria: 1) patients who visited a tertiary academic institution for the diagnosis of suspicious COVID-19 or management of confirmed COVID-19 between January 31, 2020 and March 10, 2020; and 2) patients who

underwent CXR with a dedicated protocol for suspicious COVID-19 patients including CAD analyses. The initial CXR of each patient obtained after the visit were included in the present study. All CXR were obtained with a dedicated mobile X-ray system (DRX-revolution, Carestream Health). Erect posteroanterior X-rays or supine anteroposterior X-rays were obtained, depending on the patients' condition.
Implementation of the CAD System A dedicated CXR examination protocol for patients
suspicious of COVID-19 ("CXR AI CAD for COVID") was established on January 28, 2020, and included CAD analysis. All subsequent CXR of patients who were suspected or already diagnosed with COVID-19 were obtained using this protocol. The CAD system integrated in the protocol was a commercialized deep-learning algorithm (Lunit INSIGHT CXR 2, Lunit Inc.) that was approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety of Korea (15) that detects several thoracic abnormalities, including pulmonary nodules, consolidation, and pneumothorax. The CAD system was originally trained with 54221 normal CXR and 35613 abnormal CXR with four major thoracic diseases including pulmonary malignancy, pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and pneumothorax (15). The CAD system provided a probability score between 0% and 100% for the presence of any of the target abnormalities on each CXR and provided localization of abnormalities when the probability score was 15% or greater, with contour lines overlaid on CXR images (Figs. 1-3). The system was unable to provide detailed information on whether each detected abnormality was a nodule, mass, consolidation, or pneumothorax.
After the acquisition of the CXR, analysis by the CAD system was automatically processed, and both radiologists and referring physicians could view the CAD result side-byside with the original CXR image on the institution's picture archiving and communication system (PACS; Infinitt Gx PACS, INFINITT Healthcare). After evaluation of both CXR images and CAD results, radiologists documented a formal report using the PACS (formal radiology report, hereinafter). All CXR were interpreted by attending radiologists or by radiology residents supervised by attending radiologists. A total of 14 attending radiologists and 12 residents (1-29 years of experience in CXR interpretation) participated in CXR interpretation.
Diagnostic Performance Evaluation The formal radiology reports of all CXR were

retrospectively reviewed by one thoracic radiologist (9 years of experience in CXR and chest CT interpretation), and classified into those indicating the presence versus those indicating the absence of any abnormality suggesting pneumonia. For the CAD results, a probability score of 15% (threshold for visualization of localization information) was defined as the threshold for binary classification between positive and negative results.
The diagnostic performance of formal radiology reports and CAD results were evaluated using two different reference standards: 1) rRT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 2) pulmonary abnormality suggesting pneumonia on chest CT. For evaluation based on rRT-PCR results, only patients

with an available rRT-PCR result within 24 hours of the CXR were included. Positive rRT-PCR results from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs indicated COVID-19.
For evaluation based on chest CT, only patients who underwent chest CT within 24 hours of the CXR were included. All chest CTs were obtained based on the decision of the referring physician, without pre-defined criteria for CT acquisition. Two thoracic radiologists (9 and 10 years of experience in CXR and chest CT interpretation) independently reviewed all chest CTs to determine the presence of abnormalities suggesting pneumonia. Discordant interpretations were arbitrated by the final decision of a senior thoracic radiologist (21 years of experience in CXR

and chest CT interpretation). In patients with pulmonary abnormalities suggesting pneumonia on chest CTs, two thoracic radiologists determined whether the abnormality was visible on CXR until a consensus was reached. Subsequently, the formal radiology reports of the CXR and CAD results were compared to the presence of abnormalities on chest CTs. Positive radiology reports or CAD results with incorrect localization of abnormalities were regarded as false negatives.
Among patients with chest CTs, in cases of false positive

identification by formal radiology reports or CAD, a single thoracic radiologist reviewed CXR and chest CTs to determine the cause of the false positive detection.
Subgroup Evaluation of Diagnostic Performance We compared the rRT-PCR- and chest CT-based diagnostic
performance of formal radiology reports and CAD results between patients with and without symptoms suggesting acute respiratory disease, as well as between patients with a symptom duration of  3 days or > 3 days.

Turnaround Time Evaluation The turnaround time (TAT) of each CXR report by
radiologists and rRT-PCR result (time interval between CXR or specimen acquisition and formal reporting) were obtained.
Statistical Analyses The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values
(PPVs), and negative predictive values (NPVs) of the formal radiology reports and the standalone CAD results were obtained. The sensitivities and specificities were compared using McNemar's test, while the PPVs and NPVs were compared using the method suggested by Leisenring et al. (16). Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used for the comparison of performance between different subgroups depending on the situation. Median tests were performed for the comparison of TATs.
All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.5.5, R Project for Statistical Computing), and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
A total of 395 patients (205 male and 190 female; mean age ± standard deviation, 53 ± 24 years) were included in this study. Among them, 283 (71.6%) patients had symptoms suggesting acute respiratory disease, and the median time interval between the symptom onset and CXR was 1 day (interquartile range [IQR], 4 days) (Table 1).

In formal radiology reports, abnormalities suggesting pneumonia were reported in 31.9% (126/395) of CXR, while the CAD system identified abnormalities in 36.7% (145/395) of CXR. The CAD system identified the same abnormalities reported on the formal reports in 72.2% (91/126) of CXR with positive reports. Among the CXR in which the CAD system identified abnormalities, 33.1% (48/145) were discarded as false positives by the interpreting radiologists.
Diagnostic Performance for rRT-PCR Positive COVID-19 Among 332 patients (84.1%; 173 male and 159 female;
mean age ± standard deviation, 57 ± 23 years) with available rRT-PCR results within 24 hours of CXR, SARS-CoV2 infections were identified in 16 patients (4.8%; 9 male and 7 female; mean age ± standard deviation, 60 ± 20 years). Among them, 12 patients (75%) were symptomatic, and the median time interval between the symptom onset and CXR was 5 days (IQR, 9 days).
The formal radiology reports exhibited sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 68.8%, 66.7%, 9.5%, and 97.7%, respectively. The specificity (p = 0.005) and PPV (p = 0.033) of the formal radiology reports were significantly higher than those of the CAD output (sensitivity, 43.8%; specificity, 59.8%; PPV, 5.2%; NPV, 95.5%), but there was no significant difference in the sensitivity (p = 0.102) and NPV (p = 0.061) (Table 2).

Diagnostic Performance of Pneumonia Detection on CXR Based on Chest CT Findings
Chest CTs obtained within 24 hours of CXR were available in 119 patients (30.1%; 75 male and 44 female; mean age ± standard deviation, 69 ± 14 years). Among them, 45.3% (54/119) exhibited pulmonary abnormalities suggesting pneumonia on CT (Table 3).

False positives on CXR occurred in 18 formal radiology reports and 32 CAD results (Table 4), with pleural effusion as the most common cause in both. The second most common cause of false positives was interstitial lung diseases for the formal radiology reports and pulmonary nodules for the CAD results.

For identification of pneumonia demonstrated on chest CTs, neither the performance of formal radiology reports nor CAD results showed a significant difference between patients with and without symptoms suggesting acute respiratory disease, as well as between patients with symptom duration  3 days and > 3 days (Table 6).

Variation in Performances with the Presence and Duration of Symptoms
For identification of rRT-PCR-positive COVID-19 patients, neither the performance of formal radiology reports nor the CAD results showed a significant between patients with and without symptoms suggesting acute respiratory disease (Table 5). Regarding the duration of symptoms, the formal radiology reports exhibited higher specificity (67.0% vs. 49.0%; p = 0.020) in patients with a symptom duration of  3 days. Both the formal radiology reports (3.3% vs. 19.4%; p = 0.016) and the CAD results (1.4% vs. 17.2%; p = 0.007) exhibited higher PPV in patients with symptom duration > 3 days.

Evaluation of Turnaround Times The median TAT for CXR reports was significantly shorter
than that for rRT-PCR results (51 [IQR, 138] vs. 507 [IQR, 475] minutes; p < 0.001).
The TATs for CXR reports did not differ significantly between patients with positive versus those with negative rRT-PCR results (median TAT, 186 [IQR, 953] vs. 61 [IQR, 141] minutes; p = 0.200), or between patients with versus those without pulmonary abnormalities suggesting pneumonia on chest CTs (median TAT, 60 [IQR, 122] vs. 51 [IQR, 106] minutes; p = 0.920). Furthermore, the TATs for rRT-PCR results did not significantly differ between patients with positive versus those with negative rRT-PCR

DISCUSSION
Herein, we have described our experience of a deep learning-based CAD system for the interpretation of CXR of suspected COVID-19 patients. The formal radiology reports with the assistance of CAD exhibited sensitivity of 68.8% and specificity of 66.7% for the identification of rRT-PCRpositive COVID-19 patients, and a sensitivity of 81.5% and specificity of 72.3% for the identification of pulmonary abnormalities suggesting pneumonia on chest CT.
The positive rate of rRT-PCR in our study (4.8%) was higher than the cumulative positive rate in Korea (2.3% as of April 4, 2020) (17), but similar to the data published in the earlier stage of the outbreak (4.5% as of March 2,

2020) (18). Previous studies have reported that CXR of COVID-19
patients may appear normal (19-21). Furthermore, reported imaging findings of COVID-19 were bilateral ground-glass opacities with or without consolidations, which are nonspecific in diagnosing COVID-19 (19-23). Not surprisingly, both formal radiology reports (sensitivity, 68.8%; specificity, 66.7%) and CAD results (sensitivity, 43.8%; specificity, 59.8%) showed limited diagnostic performance for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the present study. The sensitivity of formal radiology reports in our study was similar to that of baseline CXR reported in a previous study by Wong et al. (21) (69%). Although there was no statistically significant difference, the standalone CAD results exhibited a substantially lower sensitivity compared to the formal radiology reports (68.8% vs. 43.8%), suggesting limited potential for diagnosis of COVID-19 on CXR with the CAD system only.
Despite the limited diagnostic performance, the radiological evaluation of lung lesions in COVID-19

patients may still have clinical implications. Previous studies reported the value of chest CT-based diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients with initial false-negative rRT-PCR results (4-6). In addition, Zhao et al. (24) reported that the extent of abnormalities on chest CT was greater in severe diseases. Furthermore, previous investigations on severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak between 2002 and 2004 have reported that the extent of pulmonary opacity on CXR was a prognostic factor for the adverse patient outcome (25-27). However, obtaining chest CT for all patients suspected for COVID-19 can be very challenging in practice due to the limited availability of CT scanners dedicated to COVID-19 patients, as well as the contagion risk of the virus. Therefore, CXR can be used as the main radiologic examination for patients suspected for COVID-19 and may assist with patient management and prognosis prediction.
With regards to the identification of pulmonary abnormalities suggesting pneumonia based on chest CT, both the formal radiology reports and CAD results exhibited sensitivities of 81.5%. According to a previous multi-center cohort study by Self et al. (12) comprising 3423 patients in the emergency department, the sensitivity of CXR for pulmonary opacity, with chest CT as a reference standard, was 43.5%. Hence, we considered that the sensitivity of the CAD system would be acceptable for implementation in clinical practice to detect pneumonia. Although we were unable to determine the baseline performance of radiologists without use of the CAD system, it may enhance sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary abnormalities. In a previous study using the same CAD system, the sensitivity of radiology residents for identification of abnormal CXR were significantly enhanced (65.6-73.4%) after review of the CAD results (28).
Although the CAD system utilized in our study was only designed to detect a limited number of abnormalities, including pulmonary nodules, masses, consolidations, and pneumothorax, the CAD could actually identify other types of lung parenchymal abnormalities, such as ground-glass opacities, the representative imaging finding of COVID-19 (Fig. 1), since it was initially trained to identify various thoracic diseases including pneumonia (15). Because parenchymal abnormalities related to pneumonia, such as consolidation, ground-glass opacities, reticular opacities often look similar and are indistinguishable on CXR, the CAD system was trained to identify abnormalities related to pneumonia, and was not confined to consolidations.

However, the non-specific identification of several abnormalities also resulted in false positives, which led to diminished specificity (59.8% for rRT-PCR-positive COVID-19; 58.7% for CT abnormality suggesting pneumonia) of the CAD (Table 3). However, these false positives could be significantly reduced in the formal reports, since CAD was only used as an assistant tool for radiologists, who were able to discard these false positives upon their interpretation of CXR.
In addition to morphologic types of abnormality on CXR, the visibility of abnormalities on CXR may be important for the detectability of the lesions. In our study, both the CAD system and formal radiology reports exhibited significantly higher sensitivities for visible abnormalities than invisible abnormalities. Although extensive ground-glass opacities that are clearly visible on CXR can be identified by the CAD (Fig. 1), subtle ground-glass opacities that are barely visible on CXR may be missed by the CAD (Fig. 2).
In our study, the formal radiology reports for CXR exhibited satisfactory TATs (median, 51 minutes), that were significantly shorter than those of the rRT-PCR results (median, 507 minutes). Therefore, we believe that CXR may help screening and triage of patients with high suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia, especially during an outbreak where there are limited resources for hospitalization and intensive care (21, 29). Considering that our study was performed in a tertiary-referral hospital where radiologists were readily available to interpret CXR, report TATs might be much longer in primary healthcare or community-level practice where immediate availability of radiologists may be limited. Although further studies are required, we believe the CAD system may assist with timely clinical decision making in those situations. In this situation, patients with positive radiographs could be subject to enhanced isolation, which would minimize the transmission of COVID-19 while waiting for rRT-PCR results.
In our practice, no significant difference was observed in the TATs of CXR reports and rRT-PCR results between patients with and without COVID-19, or between patients with and without pneumonia. If the CAD system could be integrated with a notification system that could inform radiologists or physicians of abnormal CAD results immediately after the acquisition of CXR, it may facilitate prioritization of patients with higher suspicion of pneumonia (30).
Our study has several limitations. First, the formal radiology reports analyzed in the present study were results of interpretation using the CAD system. Therefore, a direct

comparison of performance between the radiologists and the CAD system was not possible, and we could not evaluate whether the CAD system improved the performance of radiologists. To evaluate the effect of the CAD system on the performance of radiologists in a suspected COVID-19 population, further investigation, including the interpretation before and after use of the CAD system, is warranted. Second, our study was performed in a single tertiary institution with a limited number of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize our results, considering that the situation for evaluating patients suspected for COVID-19 may differ significantly across institutions or countries. Third, the CAD system utilized in our study was not trained for all radiographic abnormalities, nor was it trained specifically for COVID-19.
In summary, we implemented a deep learning-based CAD system for the interpretation of CXR of patients suspected for COVID-19. The formal radiology reports with the assistance of CAD exhibited reasonably acceptable performances for identification of rRT-PCR-positive COVID-19 patients (sensitivity, 68.8%) and CT abnormalities suggesting pneumonia (sensitivity, 81.5%). Moreover, the CAD system resulted in faster TATs than rRT-PCR results. In situations where there are limited medical resources, such as during an outbreak, CXR interpretation with the assistance of CAD may assist clinical decision making and management of patients suspected for COVID-19.

ABSTRACT
Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been deployed broadly as an early warning tool for emerging COVID-19 outbreaks. WBE can inform targeted interventions and identify communities with high transmission, enabling quick and effective responses. As the wastewater (WW) becomes an increasingly important indicator for COVID-19 transmission, more robust methods and metrics are needed to guide public health decision-making. This research aimed to develop and implement a mathematical framework to infer incident cases of COVID-19 from SARS-CoV-2 levels measured in WW. We propose a classification scheme to assess the adequacy of model training periods based on clinical testing rates and assess the sensitivity of model predictions to training periods. A testing period is classified as adequate when the rate of change in testing is greater than the rate of change in cases. We present a Bayesian deconvolution and linear regression model to estimate COVID-19 cases from WW data. The effective reproductive number is estimated from reconstructed cases using WW. The proposed modeling framework was applied to three Northern California communities served by distinct WW treatment plants. The results showed that training periods with adequate testing are essential to provide accurate projections of COVID-19 incidence.

Organization (WHO) recommended implementing mass testing programs as a containment measure. Individual diagnostic testing informs contact tracing and medical interventions, ideally cutting chains of transmission short and containing outbreaks. Mass clinical screening programs can also provide valuable data on community-level health trends, but maintaining mass testing programs for the purpose of community-level monitoring is expensive and requires robust infrastructure with consistent availability of testing supplies and human resources (Vandenberg et al., 2021). Moreover, diagnostic tests validated in low-throughput clinical settings (like nucleic acid amplification tests or NAATs) are not necessarily efficient platforms for constructing community screening programs (Raffle et al., 2020). Design-wise, employing such tests for large-scale screening requires extensive logistical coordination over large geographic areas. This becomes especially complicated when the options for diagnostic tests are myriad, lack standardization, and depend heavily on local social landscapes. Small biases in the tests may be inflated when deployed broadly, leading to large spurious associations at the population level (Mardian et al., 2021; Mercer and Salit, 2021).
Public health authorities are turning to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as an alternative strategy for less-biased population-level surveillance of COVID-19. WBE uses biomarkers in wastewater (WW) to monitor trends in community-level health indices. WBE methods have been used to detect changes in drug consumption (Castiglioni et al., 2014; Zuccato et al., 2005), dietary patterns (Choi et al., 2019), and the circulation of pathogens like poliovirus and norovirus (Asghar et al., 2014). Measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in WW correlate strongly with changes in COVID-19 prevalence in the associated communities (Huisman et al., 2022; McMahan et al., 2021; Vallejo et al., 2022; Wolfe et al., 2021). Since the onset of the pandemic, WBE of SARS-CoV-2 has been implemented in over 67 countries and 279 universities (COVIDPoops19, 2021). In some places, WBE programs have detected changes in SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in WW prior to changes in local COVID-19 hospitalization activity and spikes in NAAT screening cases (Kirby et al., 2022; Mallapaty et al., 2020; Medema et al., 2020b; Peccia et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2022; Wurtzer et al., 2020). Others have used WBE to assess the effectiveness of public health interventions (Pillay et al., 2021), and recently, WBE was used to predict hospitalizations and ICU admissions (Galani et al., 2022). In addition to monitoring trends, WBE can provide estimates of critical disease transmission parameters in the community without the biases associated with test-seeking behavior or poor access to testing programs.
An ongoing challenge for WBE is developing robust data collection and interpretation methods that are comparable across time and geography. Variations in sampling design and sample processing methods, natural variability in viral shedding rates in feces, variability in WW flow volume, population fluctuations, and location-specific characteristics of WW management are all factors that make inference of new COVID-19 cases from WW data challenging (Ahmed et al., 2020; Hill et al., 2020; Medema et al., 2020a; Zhu et al., 2021). Such factors will ultimately affect uncertainty estimates when modeling disease incidence and other public health indicators. An ideal WBE program would implement a generalized approach that provides consistent estimates of disease burden in a targeted population, yielding public health metrics like the disease incidence, disease prevalence and/or the effective reproductive number (Re). Previous studies that approach this problem include: simple algebraic adjustments with environmental constants (Monteiro et al., 2022); estimating the total number of cases with a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model informed by WW results (McMahan et al., 2021); using regression analysis to estimate the number of infected people (Vallejo et al., 2022); and making near real-time estimates of Re (Huisman et al., 2022; Schoen et al., 2022).
We propose and compare two modeling approaches: a simple linear model and a Bayesian deconvolution approach to estimate COVID-19 incident cases from WW viral loads. Both models rely on short training periods to calibrate WW measurements using clinical testing data from a community screening program. We evaluate the impact of different training periods on model predictions, hypothesizing that relative rates of change in clinical testing and reported cases can be used to identify appropriate

model training periods. We then apply the framework to estimate incident cases and Re from WW influent data generated for three communities in Northern California. The methodology we describe can be generalized to other WBE systems to track the evolution and assess the magnitude of COVID-19 fluctuations and outbreaks in a manner that is comparable across programs, locations, and time.
2. Material and methods
The analytical framework was developed using data from the City of Davis (Davis) and replicated for the City of Woodland and the University of California Davis (UC Davis). The analysis includes case and WW data from December 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022. Results for the City of Woodland and UC Davis are presented in Appendices C and D, respectively.
2.1. Wastewater sample collection
Staff from three Northern California WW treatment facilities (Davis, Woodland, and UC Davis) provided 24-hour composite WW samples 5-7 days per week. Samples were acquired using Teledyne ISCO 5800 refrigerated autosamplers in Davis and Woodland and a Hach Sigma 900 autosampler for UC Davis. The autosampler in Davis was programmed to collect 400 mL of influent every 15 "pulses", where one pulse was set at 10,000 gal. An average of 24 pulses was expected per day based on an average daily influent flow of 3.6 million gallons per day (MGD). The autosampler in Woodland was programmed to acquire 100 mL of influent every 15 min over a 24-hour period. The autosampler for UC Davis was programmed to acquire approximately 200 mL of influent every 20 min over a 24-hour period. The reported sample collection date corresponded to the date when an autosampler program was completed. Davis and UC Davis provided 12 mL samples in new 15-mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes. Woodland provided 1 L samples in Nalgene bottles that were washed, sterilized, and reused over the duration of sampling. Samples were stored at 4 °C and transported weekly in coolers on ice to the analytical lab at UC Davis. For biosafety compliance, samples were placed in a water bath set at 60 °C for 30 min and returned to 4 °C prior to sample processing. Concentration and extraction were performed in a biosafety level 2 (BSL2)-certified laboratory.
2.2. Sample concentration and extraction
The sample concentration and extraction protocol were adapted from Karthikeyan et al. (2021) using 4.875 mL instead of 10 mL starting sample volume. Each WW sample was deposited into a separate well of a KingFisher 24 deep-well plate (Thermo Fisher). An extraction control blank (nucleasefree water) was included in 90 % of the deep-well plates to assess potential contamination during concentration and extraction. Each well was spiked with 50 L of Nanotrap® Enhancement Reagent 1 (Ceres Nanosciences product ER1 SKU # 10111-10, 10111-30) and 5 L of a stock of vaccine-strain Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV, Bovilis® Coronavirus vaccine) containing an estimated 1.3 × 108 gc/mL as measured by ddPCR. 500 L aliquots of the initial BCoV vaccine stock, prepared from the suspension of lyophilized BCoV vaccine in 20 mL buffer provided with the kit, were stored at -80 ° C prior to use. Each spiked sample was manually agitated by pipetting up and down at least three times using a 5 mL pipette. Samples were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Following incubation, concentration was carried out using 75 L Nanotrap® Magnetic Virus Particles (Ceres Nanosciences) on a KingFisher Apex robot (Thermo Scientific). Concentrated viruses were eluted from the Nanotrap® beads into 400 mL of lysis buffer per sample from the MagMAX Microbiome Ultra Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher). Concentrated samples were extracted per the MagMAX kit manufacturer instructions in 96 deep-well plates on the KingFisher Apex. Samples were eluted in 100 L of MagMAX Elution Solution. Extracts were typically stored on ice and immediately subjected to same-day analysis. When the same-day analysis was not possible, extracts were immediately stored at -80 ° C until analysis.

2.3. Extract analysis by ddPCR
Sample extracts were analyzed by digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) for four targets: N1 and N2 targeting regions of the nucleocapsid (N) gene of SARS-CoV-2, and Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) for normalization of the SARS-CoV-2 results. N1/N2 and BCoV/PMMoV were quantified in separate duplex assays. Due to high levels of PMMoV, the sample for the PMMoV/BCoV duplex was diluted 40× prior to loading. The duplex ddPCR amplifications were performed in 20 L reactions on a QX ONE ddPCR System (Bio-Rad). Each reaction contained the following components: 1× Supermix, 20 U/L Reverse transcriptase, 15 mM Dithiothreitol from the One-Step RT-ddPCR Advanced Kit for Probe (Bio-Rad), 900 nM of each primer, 250 nM of each probe, and 5 L of sample extract or control. The one-step ddPCR reaction consisted of 3 min plate equilibrium at 25 ° C, 60 min reverse transcription at 50 ° C, 10 min enzyme activation at 95 ° C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 ° C and 1 min annealing/extension at 58 ° C, and then 10 min enzyme deactivation at 98 ° C and 1 min droplet stabilization at 25 ° C. Preparation and plating of ddPCR master mix were carried out in a separate location from sample loading to avoid contamination. Sample loading was performed using an epMotionR 5075 (Eppendorf) liquid handler. Each ddPCR plate included duplicate positive controls (stock mixture of synthesized gene fragments containing for the four target regions) for each target and duplicated no-template controls (nuclease free water). Additional information on the ddPCR assay designs is available in Appendix A. Table A.1 summarizes primers, probes for ddPCR assays performed as part of this work. Tables A.2 and A.3 provide the ddPCR reaction and 20× primer/probe mix recipes. From October 21 to December 21, Cy5 and Cy5.5 were used in place of FAM and HEX as the fluorophores for PMMoV and BCoV, respectively. Table A.4 lists details for the positive controls. Prior to 12/21/22 the annealing temperature was 60 ° C. The selection of positive and negative droplet clusters in samples and controls was conducted manually based on visual inspection of clusters. Results were considered invalid if the distribution of positive or negative droplets appeared abnormal in shape or if the total number of droplets generated fell below a threshold of 10,000 droplets in a single well.
2.4. Laboratory quality control and data processing
The sensitivity of the analytical assay was assessed by determining a limit of detection (LOD) and a limit of blank (LOB) following protocols recommended by the ddPCR manufacturer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 2021, A practical guide for evaluating detection capability using ddPCR). Fifteen WW samples that were initially screened as negative for SARS-CoV-2 in routine WW ddPCR monitoring (i.e., extracts had less than 4 positive droplets in merged wells from duplicate analysis) were used to determine the lowest detectable concentrations in ostensibly blank WW samples. Selection of these extracts provided a conservative approach to determining the LOB. The selected extracts were re-analyzed by ddPCR to obtain data for four additional replicates for each sample. A non-parametric (rank order) method was then used to select the LOB, since results from the blank

Science of the Total Environment 858 (2023) 159680
were not normally distributed. The ddPCR number of droplets from individual wells was tabulated from lowest to highest. The LOB was set at the value of the concentration measurement for the rank position corresponding to the 95th percentile, calculated as follows: Rank = 0.5 + 0.95 (number of measurements). Since the calculated rank position was a non-integer value, the rank position was rounded up to provide a more conservative LOB. The theoretical LOD was set as the LOB plus two times the standard deviation of all replicate results (Biorad, 2021). The LOD and LOB are reported in Table A.5. In terms of droplet numbers in the blank samples, the highest numbers of positive droplets in the merged wells (four replicates) amongst the fifteen blank samples were 6 (N1) and 8 (N2). Since routine WW samples were analyzed in duplicate, 3 (N1) and 4 (N2) droplets were set as the cutoff to mark samples below the droplet threshold. Samples were also considered below the droplet threshold if there were fewer N1 and N2 droplets than twice the number of droplets in the extraction control blank analyzed on the same day. Runs with an extraction control blank that had >15 positive droplets in either N1 or N2 were considered contaminated and extracts were re-processed.
If samples passed all checks, the relative concentration of N gene was calculated as follows. Duplicate results for each target were merged, and the concentration of each target in the ddPCR reaction was calculated assuming a Poisson distribution using the QXOne Software 1.1.1 Standard Addition (Bio-Rad). The average SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in the initial WW sample was calculated from the average of the N1 and N2 results, corrected for sample and reagent volumes used, and reported as genome copies (gc) per mL WW. BCoV was detected in 100 % of spiked samples, and concentrations of targets were not corrected for BCoV recovery efficiency. If N1 or N2 merged droplet counts were below the minimum droplet threshold, the target was excluded from the average concentration. If both N1 and N2 targets were below the droplet threshold, the concentration was reported as 0. We utilize N/PMMoV (the average SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration (N) divided by the concentration of PMMoV) as the resulting WW signal for subsequent model development.
2.5. COVID-19 case data
Healthy Davis Together (HDT) and Healthy Yolo Together (HYT) provided daily COVID-19 cases and total tests performed during the study period for Davis, UC Davis, and Woodland, from the community screening program (HDT, 2020; HYT, 2021). HDT was a program implemented in the city of Davis as an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and facilitate the return "normal". The citywide effort launched in September 2020 before expanding to the rest of Yolo County the following July as part of a re-branded HYT. The program involved free saliva-based asymptomatic and symptomatic testing with high throughput methods to process large volumes of tests.
Daily observations of cases were smoothed for implementing the linear model using a 7-day moving average (the mean of the current and the previous six days). This approach improves harmonization between the current WW concentration and observed cases (Fig. 1B). The 7-day moving average of cases for the linear model is similar to a deconvolution model

with equal weights (uniform shedding load distribution) and a shedding time of 7 days (Section 2.7.1). The rate of change for tests administered and positive cases were calculated from a weekly aggregation of daily test counts and positive cases identified. Changes in test and case rates were then used to determine training periods with adequate testing.
2.6. Smoothed wastewater signal
To reduce uncertainty and minimize daily fluctuations of WW data, we applied a 10-day moving average for daily influent WW data (Fig. 1A). We use the resulting smoothed influent WW data to correlate with raw cases in the deconvolution model and smoothed cases in the linear model (Fig. 1B).
2.7. Models
We present two models to estimate COVID-19 cases from SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the WW. The first model was adapted from Huisman et al.'s (2022) approach and relates past infections with WW signal through the convolution described in Eq. (3). The number of daily cases is modeled with a Negative Binomial (NB) distribution through the deconvolution (the inverse operation of convolution) noted in Eq. (3). The second approach uses a simple linear regression to estimate 7-day moving average of cases (dependent variable) from WW data (independent variable). We also propose a strategy for selecting model training periods with adequate clinical testing to estimate parameters and improve estimation.
2.7.1. Deconvolution model Viral RNA concentrations measured in WW (Ci's) are related to the num-
ber of new infections per day (Ii's) through the profile of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in the WW by an infected individual days after infection or symptom onset (Huisman et al., 2022). The measurement Ci of WW on day i is related to infections Ij on prior day j through the following convolution:

mX-1

Ci ¼ N Á M w jIi- j; i ¼ 1; ...; n;

ð1Þ

j¼0

where wj, j = 1, ..., m (sums to 1) is the shedding load distribution describing the temporal dynamics of shedding and m is the duration of viral shedding or shedding time. The normalization factor N represents the total virus shed by an infected individual during the infection period. M is a constant that depends on the sewer system, WW treatment plant, and processing pipeline.
The measurement of viral RNA in WW, Ci on the day i, is used to estimate COVID-19 cases from WW concentration data via convolution. As noted by Huisman et al. (2022), normalization factors N and M are difficult to measure, and they assume B = N  M as the lowest concentration of the viral load or concentration from a single infection (Huisman et al., 2022). The weights for shedding load distribution (wj) can be estimated using individual-pooled analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads (Cevik et al., 2020; Weiss et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). Instead, we estimate B and corresponding weights using measured WW data and cases within a specified period (training period) by directly modeling the deconvolution process through a Bayesian approach.
We model wj as follows:

w j ¼ P f bð jÞ ;

m-1 k¼0

f bðkÞ

j ¼ 0; 1; ...; m-1;

where fb(k) is the probability density function (PDF) of a random variable X with exponential distribution of rate parameter b. Hereafter, notation

wjb will be used instead of wj emphasizing that weights depends on parameter b. Note that, if X  Exp(b) then its PDF is fb(k) = be-bk, thus:

wb ¼ P be-bÁk ¼ P e-bÁk ; j ¼ 0; 1; ...; m-1:

Eq. (1) is rewritten using Eq. (2) as follows:

mX-1

Ci ¼ B wbj Â Ii- j:

The deconvolution of the Eq. (3) will be denoted as dec(C, B,b), where C = (C1, C2, ..., Cn) represents the vector of WW data, and parameters B and b are described above. I = (I1, I2, ..., In) correspond to daily cases counts. The theoretical expectation of I is given by EðIÞ ¼  and it is estimated in terms of the deconvolution model as  = (1, 2, ..., n) = dec(C, B, b). The deconvolution is approximated using the Richardson-Lucy algorithm
(Goldstein et al., 2009).

2.7.1.1. Observational model. We estimate the number of COVID-19 cases

per day (Ii) using the NB regression, which is most relevant for

overdispersed count data. In this situation, the variance exceeds the

mean. The NB distribution describes a sequence of independent and iden-

tically distributed Bernoulli trials with a probability of success p before a

specified (non-random) number of successes (r) occurs. Assuming a similar

approach as in Lindén and Mäntyniemi (2011), we reparametrized the NB

distribution in terms of its mean  and "overdispersion" parameters  and

Using the deconvolution model and parameter as described above, we

obtain the following likelihood function with the assumed NB model:

We estimate  = (B, b) from measurements of WW data C =

(C1, C2, ..., Cn) and daily observations of COVID-19 cases I = (I1, I2, ..., In).

We adopt a Bayesian statistical approach, which is well suited to model

multiple sources of uncertainty and allows the incorporation of background

knowledge on the model's parameters. In this framework, a prior distribu-

tion, (), is required to account for unknown parameter  in order to

obtain the posterior distribution. For b, we assumed a Gamma distribution

with shape and scale parameters vb = 2 and Sb = 1, respectively; this

assumption is based on published data on viral shedding duration in gastro-

intestinal samples (Benefield et al., 2020). For B, we assumed a Gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters vM = 2 and SM = 2/1e-4,

respectively; based on the lowest viral RNA concentrations observed

(Huisman et al., 2022). Having specified the likelihood and the prior, we

use Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior distribution,

jC;IðjC; IÞ ¼ ðÞLðjC; IÞ ; ZðIÞ

where Z(I) =  ()L(| C, I)d is the normalization constant. The posterior distribution is simulated using an existing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the t-walk algorithm (Christen et al., 2010).

2.7.1.2. Duration of viral shedding. The deviance information criterion (DIC) was used to select the shedding time (m). DIC is a Bayesian generalization of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for model selection in a finite set of models, with preference given to models with lower DIC. The DIC is preferred in settings with Bayesian model selection problems where the model's posterior distributions are obtained by MCMC simulation (Spiegelhalter et al., 2002). We selected the appropriate shedding time by computing DIC in a grid search along the parameter space m : {6, ..., 10} (Benefield et al., 2020).
2.7.2. SimplÀe linear regresÁsion model Let ~I ¼ ~I1,~I2, . . . , ~In be the vector of 7-day moving average of cases
(smoothed cases) and C = (C1, C2, ..., Cn) be the vector of WW data. We assume the following noise model,
logÀ~IiÁ ¼  logðCiÞ þ i; i ¼ 1; ...; n ð4Þ
where i is a random residual associated with observation i which is assumed to be distributed as N(0, 2), with 2 as the residual variance. This inference problem aims to estimate  = (, ) from WW data and smoothed cases. A log-linear model is assumed to address positively skewed data and prevent negative fitted values.

Science of the Total Environment 858 (2023) 159680
2.8. Selection of model training periods
We describe whether or not testing is adequate in a particular period of observed cases by calculating the rate of change in tests conducted and new cases within a specific time period. We define the rate of change of both tests conducted (riT) and confirmed positive cases (ric) during period i as riT = Ti/Ti-1 and ric = ci/ci-1, respectively, where Ti-1, Ti denote the number of tests carried out in two consecutive periods, and ci-1, ci denote the number of positive cases detected in these periods. We classify a testing period as adequate when the rate of change in testing is greater than the rate of change in cases; otherwise, if the rate of change in testing is lower/equal to the rate of change in cases, we conclude that the testing period is inadequate. We summarize various scenarios of testing adequacy in Table 1. Our determination of testing adequacy, and thus suitability for model training for both linear and deconvolution models, assumes that observed cases would be sufficiently close to true cases when testing rates are high compared to case rates and test positivity remains low as determined through the community screening programs.
2.9. Effective reproductive number
The number of people in a population who are susceptible to infection by an infected individual at any particular time is denoted by Re, the effective reproductive number. This dimensionless quantity is sensitive to timedependent variation due to reductions in susceptible individuals, changes in population immunity, and other factors. Re can be estimated by the ratio of the number of new infections (It) generated at time t, to the total infectious individuals at time t, given by st=1It-sws, the sum of infection incidence up to time step t - 1, weighted by the infectivity function ws. We implemented Cori et al.'s (2013) approach to estimate Re directly from observed cases and from cases that were estimated from the WW data.
3. Results
3.1. Identification of adequate training periods
We computed the rate of change in the number of tests and cases by week for Davis between December 1, 2021, and March 31, 2022 (Fig. 2). Each week was compared with a previous week and classified as

The week-to-week rate of change in cases and tests are displayed; blue numbers indicate the test rate is greater than the case rate, and red numbers are the opposite. The blue and red shaded region corresponds training periods with Adequate (TA) and Not Adequate (TNA) testing.

adequate whenever the rate of change in tests was greater than the rate of change in cases and as not adequate otherwise.
Fig. 2 illustrates two specific training periods assumed for the analysis of Davis. The first training period includes data from December 12, 2021, to January 8, 2022 (denoted by TNA), and the second training period assumes data from January 9 to February 2, 2022 (denoted by TA). A training period designated by TNA (Not Adequate) corresponds to a scenario where the test rate is consistently lower than the rate of new cases. Similarly, a training period denoted by TA corresponds to a scenario where the testing rate exceeds the rate of new cases. We assess testing adequacy for Woodland and UC Davis (Figs. C.1 and D.1); similarly identified a period of inadequate testing prior to an observed surge in infections.
3.2. Comparison of models to estimate public health metrics from wastewater data
We applied a deconvolution technique and a linear regression to reconstruct incident cases of COVID-19 from the WW data, assuming model training periods according to the adequacy of clinical testing efforts. We found that the magnitude of case projections and trends was sensitive to the assumption of the model training period for both model constructs (Fig. 3). However, the timing of peaks in cases predicted was independent of the training period.
Case predictions from the models that assumed a training period with inadequate testing (TNA) were consistently lower than projections from the models that assumed a training period with adequate testing (TA), and also lower than observed cases mostly. These results and our assumption that true cases are above that of observed cases suggest that models using TNA systematically underestimated true cases. This finding is consistent with our expectations since fewer cases are detected during TNA than TA periods. Projection of cases from models that assumed TA aligned more consistently with observed cases in periods where testing was deemed adequate. The difference in case predictions from the two training periods

Science of the Total Environment 858 (2023) 159680
was particularly evident in January 2021, during the onset of the Omicron variant surge in Davis.
Case projections from the linear model that assumed TA were able to capture the peak of the observed cases more closely than the deconvolution model, although with greater uncertainty. It is worth noting that results from the deconvolution and the linear models are similar because the linear model is fitted with the 7-day movingaverage of case data. Data smoothing of this kind corresponds to a convolution with equal daily weights. The estimation of cases from the linear model assuming TNA was similar to the results of the deconvolution model, Fig. 3B.
Re monitors changes in disease transmission over time, assesses the effectiveness of interventions, and can be useful in guiding policy decision-making. Estimates of Re from the median of the predicted cases using the deconvolution and linear models are similar. In most of the period assessed, Re determined from WW results are quite similar in magnitude and follow the trends for Re calculated using observed cases (Fig. 4B). A notable difference between the Re estimated with the observed cases and that obtained with the WW data, using both the linear and the deconvolution model, occurs in mid-March and days that followed. In mid-March, the median of Re estimated with observed cases was above 1, and the medians of Re estimated with WW data for the linear and deconvolution model were below 1. Later, the behavior was opposite; Re for cases was below 1, and the medians of Re with WW data for the linear and deconvolution model were above 1. During these periods, the observed cases (Ii) were between 0 and 8 per day, with many days of zeros. These low counts make the calculation of Re with the observed cases unreliable. As recommended by Cori et al. (2013), Re should only be estimated for incidence greater than 10, Ii  10. On the other hand, the predictive median of the cases with which we calculate the Re was between 7 and 11 cases per day, making the calculation of Re more reliable than those computed based on observed cases. The posterior analysis using the estimated Re from WW data thus indicates

Fig. 3. Predicted cases assuming the deconvolution (A) and linear (B) models. Estimated cases using an adequate (TA) training period for each model are displayed in blue/ purple; results assuming an inadequate (TNA) period are shown in red. Solid lines and shaded regions illustrate the median and 95 % prediction intervals, respectively.

that an outbreak (Re > 1) may have occurred in Davis that was not detected through clinical cases (Fig. B.1).
While the magnitude of predicted cases differed with or without adequate training periods, similar trends in cases were obtained. This, in turn, was reflected in similar estimates of Re (Fig. 5) since the estimate of Re is scale-free. This finding shows that these models are able to track infection dynamics even with inadequate training periods.
We demonstrate the adaptability of our methodology using data for Woodland and UC Davis and present results in Appendices C and D, respectively. The trends of the observed cases are recovered with both

models (Figs. C.2 and D.2), yielding results consistent with those obtained for Davis.
4. Discussion
Community-wide testing has played a critical role in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. However, large-scale testing has been limited and falls further behind during surges of infections. We developed criteria to classify the adequacy of clinical testing in a community through time, and we applied the classification scheme to three Northern California communities. As was observed in many other

Fig. 5. Re of Davis using the median of cases estimated assuming the deconvolution model with adequate (TA) and inadequate (TNA) training periods. 7

M.L. Daza-Torres et al.
communities at the time, we found that clinical testing was inadequate at the front end of the wave of Omicron infections that occurred during our study period. Inadequate clinical testing during surges of infection makes it particularly challenging to discern true levels of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a population. WBE can fill data gaps caused by inadequate testing programs. As clinical testing transitions further towards at-home self-testing, measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in WW can serve as an increasingly important indicator for COVID-19 transmission.
Myriad sources of variability and uncertainty in WW data can nevertheless impact the accuracy of estimates of COVID-19 cases or other public health metrics derived from WW data (Arabzadeh et al., 2021; Belia et al., 2009; Courbariaux et al., 2022; Li et al., 2021). Statistically representative samples can also be difficult to obtain because of the complexity of WW collection systems and the physical challenge of ensuring consistency in sample acquisition and processing (Panchal et al., 2021). Such challenges can limit the comparability of WW results across different WBE programs. The modeling framework we described to estimate COVID-19 cases from WW data accounts for uncertainty and relies on short training periods using clinical testing data to calibrate WW measurements to local conditions.
We showed that case projections reconstructed from either the Bayesian deconvolution or the simple linear model were generally higher than cases observed through clinical testing, particularly during periods with sub-optimal testing. These results are not surprising, as we expected that the WW models would yield case estimates higher than cases observed through screening, given that WW is not subject to the same selection biases as testing. While both the deconvolution and linear regression models captured the trends in observed cases overall, qualitative differences were evident between the approaches, particularly when testing was limited. Both models identified steep upward trends in cases during the surge in mid-January and at the onset of the Omicron surge Fig. 4A.
The classification approach we developed to assess the adequacy of model training periods was essential to providing robust estimates of case projections. Training periods that satisfied the proposed characteristics (i.e., adequate testing) resulted in similar estimates from each model and yielded trends consistent with observed cases. Case projections that assumed training periods with poor testing generally underestimated cases compared to projections from adequate training periods. While the proposed models do not seek to recover the curve of reported cases (an underestimate of actual cases, especially in a limited testing scenario), the use of adequate training periods for the WW models enabled us to capture trends in case counts much more closely. It is evident that training periods with inadequate testing introduce a downward bias into the model.
WBE has substantially lower resource requirements than mass diagnostic testing, and WW data lack bias from care- and test-seeking behavior in the catchment population. WBE programs that determine COVID19 public health metrics at the community level can work as a powerful and cost-effective complement to other, more traditional intervention methods. The analytic methods presented here can inform local public health policy and community-level interventions, for instance, by helping to assess when the initiation of clinical screening programs and nonpharmaceutical interventions are needed. The model can be especially valuable to fill data gaps during surges of infection when clinical testing is inadequate and could be used to assess when estimates of case rates exceed certain thresholds. WBE does come with the inherent challenge of determining the populations being monitored, which is exacerbated if the population served is highly mobile (e.g., a university campus). In other words, WBE methods for tracking COVID-19 are inherently location-specific, whereas public screening programs are tied to the people they serve. The calibration of WW models using clinical data will be most robust in places with minimal mobility or within adequately described and understood populations.
With screening programs winding down across the United States, finding training periods with adequate testing rates may not be feasible.

Science of the Total Environment 858 (2023) 159680
In such cases, applying the deconvolution model for WBE can still highlight important trends. A periodic sentinel system could be employed to produce sufficient prevalence estimates for training periods where tests are only administered for clinical diagnostics. Such a system would recruit a representative population sample for repeated testing during a training period to establish a baseline, enabling the WW deconvolution model to track incidence for an extended period of time. The same sentinel group could be called back later when the model needs to be updated to retrain for new situations.
WBE surveillance systems should be cognizant that they are not unduly targeting and stigmatizing vulnerable communities. WBE is much less invasive than diagnostic testing and protects individual identities, thereby avoiding the stigmatization of individuals and not requiring individual consent (Murakami et al., 2020). Yet focusing too heavily on public surveillance efforts can negatively influence public perception of those being monitored (Sims and Kasprzyk-Hordern, 2020). Mathematical models that employ machine learning, such as the deconvolution model described herein, must be trained with data sets that are not sampled by biased collection methods, else they may inadvertently reintroduce social biases into the results and contribute to larger inequities in public health.
Overall, both models presented can capture disease trends with few assumptions. At least two wastewater samples per week are needed to provide accurate estimates of trends (Huisman et al., 2022; Keshaviah et al., 2021). To ensure reliable estimates for case counts, we suggest a minimum of three consecutive weeks of training periods classified as adequate, or as close to this as possible.
This study has some limitations that are worth noting. The proposed models are validated based on observed cases and are limited by their dependence on adequate training periods. The latter limitation becomes more significant as testing efforts are scaled down or as historical data on adequate testing is lacking. However, even with limited testing, our model is able to track disease trends, providing reliable estimates of Re. Our modeling framework may also lack accuracy in long-term predictions when the relationship between wastewater and cases changes over time, as it is observed with the emergence of new variants (Frampton et al., 2021; Graham et al., 2021). To address this limitation, adaptive models should be considered to allow for the re-calibration of parameters over time.
5. Significance
· We proposed a method to characterize training periods based on testing and clinical case rates.
· A training period is classified as adequate when the rate of change in tests exceeds the rates of change in cases.
· We proposed two models to relate wastewater to clinical cases: a linear model and a deconvolution model with a Bayesian approach.
· We show that case predictions from models that assumed inadequate (TNA) training periods were consistently lower than projections from the models that assumed a training period with adequate testing (TA).
· While the magnitude of predicted cases depended on training periods, similar case trends were observed. This, in turn, was reflected in similar estimates of Re, suggesting that the models are able to track infection dynamics even with inadequate training periods.

Abstract The emergence of the monkeypox outbreak in early 2022 has posed a new global health threat. As of July 8, 2022, 9069 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, and most of them are from non-endemic countries. The monkeypox virus is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus, and preliminary genetic data suggest that the 2022 monkeypox virus belongs to the West African clade. In the current outbreak, human-to-human transmission has been the primary transmission mode. Although direct skin-to-skin contact with lesions during sexual activities can spread the virus, it remains unclear whether monkeypox can spread through sexual contact, specifically through contaminated body fluids. The typical presentation of monkeypox includes prodromal symptoms, followed by a rash that usually begins within 1e3 days of symptom onset, and the skin lesions can last for 2e4 weeks and then gradually resolve. However, the monkeypox outbreak in 2022 may exhibit atypical features. A definite diagnosis of monkeypox virus infection requires nucleic acid amplification testing via the polymerase chain reaction method. Supportive care is essential, and antiviral therapy is not

Introduction
As of 18 July, 2022, more than 559 million cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported since the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in China. This outbreak has caused more than 6 million deaths globally.1,2 However, the impact of COVID-19 has been mitigated via the development of effective vaccines, antiviral agents, and other treatments.3e9 The emergence of the monkeypox outbreak in 2022 has posed another global health threat.10 Between January 1 and June 22, 2022, a total of 3413 laboratoryconfirmed cases and 1 death have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 50 countries or territories in five WHO Regions.11 As of July 8, the cumulative confirmed case numbers increased to 9069.12 Because the rapid increase of monkeypox cases, WHO declared the escalating global monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on Juy 23, 2022.
Monkeypox was first identified in colonies of monkeys in 1958. It was later detected in a 9-month child in a remote village in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970.13 Before the current outbreak, monkeypox was typically found in central and west Africa, where rodents live in tropical rainforests and may carry the virus. Occasionally, monkeypox was found in countries outside central and west Africa, owing to travel from regions where monkeypox is endemic. Notably, monkeypox in non-endemic areas not linked to travel from endemic countries is atypical, and these atypical cases have become increasingly prevalent.
Monkeypox is not typically highly contagious because it requires close physical contact with someone carrying the virus. Although the risk to the general public was considered low previously, the WHO is responding to this outbreak as a high priority to avoid further spread.11 In the 2022 outbreak, the reported cases did not have apparent links to travel history from endemic countries, or contact history with infected animals. Therefore, as the current outbreak is atypical and different from previous cases, a comprehensive understanding of monkeypox, including causative pathogen, possible transmission modalities, current epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, treatment, and prevention, is urgently needed. Hence, this review aims to provide updated information.
The virus
The monkeypox virus is a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae family. In the Orthopoxvirus genus,

only four pathogens, including monkeypox virus, cowpox virus, vaccinia virus, and the eradicated variola virusdthe causative agent of smallpoxdhave reportedly caused human infection.14
The monkeypox virus is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that comprises two genetic clades: Central African (Congo Basin) clade and West African clade. These two clades are divided geographically by Cameroon, the only country with both virus clades. The West African clade has been found in outbreaks in Nigeria, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, and the USA (imported from Ghana). The Central African clade has been found in Gabon, Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.15e18 In addition to geographical differences, these two clades significantly differ in epidemiologic and clinical characteristics. The Central African clade, endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where more than 2000 suspected cases are reported yearly, is more prevalent than the West African clade.19 Compared with the West African clade, the Central African strain could be associated with more severe disease and higher transmissibility. The West African clade is associated with a low case fatality rate (CFR) of <1%, and no human-to-human transmission has ever been documented. In contrast, the CFR of the Congo Basin clade could be up to 11%, and documented human-to-human transmissions up to six sequential events have been reported.15 Similarly, a systematic review found a significant difference in CFR between the Central African clade (10.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.4%e13.3%) and West African clade (3.6%; 95% CI: 1.7%e6.8%).20
Isidro et al. showed the first genome sequence of a case recently detected in Portugal. The authors used shotgun metagenomics for rapid reconstruction and phylogenomic characterization.21 Preliminary genomic data suggest that the 2022 monkeypox virus belongs to the West African clade21e23 and is most closely related to monkeypox viruses that spread from Nigeria to the UK, Israel, and Singapore in 2018 and 2019.21,24,25
Definition of the reported monkeypox
According to the WHO case definition, the criteria for a suspected case of monkeypox include (1) A person of any age presenting since 01 January 2022 with an unexplained acute rash or one or more acute skin lesions; (2) one of the prodromal symptom or symptoms of monkeypox infectiondheadache, acute onset of fever, lymphadenopathy, myalgia, back pain, and asthenia; and (3) the clinical

picture cannot be fully explained by the common causes of an acute rash or skin lesions.26 A probable case is defined as a person meeting the case definition for a suspected case and one of the following criteria: (1) has an epidemiological link to a probable or confirmed case of monkeypox in the 21 days before symptom onset; (2) has had multiple or anonymous sexual partners in the 21 days before symptom onset; (3) has detectable levels of antiorthopoxvirus IgM antibody or a four-fold rise in IgG antibody titer based on acute (up to days 5e7) and convalescent (day 21 onwards) samples but without recent smallpox or monkeypox vaccination or other known exposure; or (4) has a positive test result for orthopoxviral infection.26 A confirmed case was defined as a patient with a laboratory-confirmed monkeypox infection on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing or sequencing.26,27
Transmission
Many animal species are susceptible to the monkeypox virus, including rope squirrels, tree squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, and non-human primates. Although rodents are considered a potential natural reservoir of the monkeypox virus, the most important natural reservoir remains to be identified. The animal-to-human transmission of the monkeypox virus can occur through direct contact with an infected animal's blood, body fluid, skin, or mucosal lesions. In addition, consuming inappropriately cooked meat or products of infected animals could be another possible transmission route. Close physical contact is the main route of human-to-human transmission, which may require prolonged close contact. Transmission may occur through contact with skin lesions of infected patients, contaminated objects, and respiratory droplets. Rarely, congenital monkeypox results from viral transmission through the placenta. Because there are strict protocols for screening blood donations, there have been no reports of monkeypox spreading through blood transfusions. In the current outbreak, monkeypox rashes are commonly found in the genital area and likely contribute to transmission during sexual contact. In addition, monkeypox rashes can resemble those of sexually transmitted diseases, including herpes and syphilis. This may explain why several cases in the current outbreak have been identified among men seeking care in sexual health clinics.22,28e30 Although direct skin-to-skin contact during sexual activities can spread the virus, it remains unclear whether the monkeypox virus can spread through sexual contact, specifically through semen or vaginal fluids.
Epidemiology
Before the current monkeypox outbreak
Since the first report of human monkeypox in 1970,13 the number of human monkeypox cases has been on the rise, with the most dramatic increase occurring in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Before 2020, the incidence of monkeypox reportedly ranged from 0.64 per 100,000 in 2001 to as high as 50 per 10,000 in 2016.20 A systemic review involving 66 articles before September 2020 found that

human monkeypox has been reported in 10 African countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Co^te d'Ivoire, Liberia, Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Gabon, Central African, Congo, and South Sudan and four nonAfrican countries including Singapore, Israel, the UK, and the USA.20 Among these countries, the Democratic Republic of Congo is the most affected country.20
Index case of the current monkeypox outbreak
The current outbreak initiated from the first reported case in May 2022.31 The patient developed a rash on April 29, 2022, in Nigeria; departed Nigeria on May 3; and arrived in the UK on May 4. Monkeypox (West African clade) was confirmed on reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR testing of a vesicular swab on May 6. Although extensive contact tracing has been undertaken to identify exposed contacts in healthcare settings, the community, and on international flights, no compatible symptoms have been reported as of May 11. Meanwhile, the patient did not report contact with anyone with a rash illness or known monkeypox in Nigeria; thus, the source of infection remains unknown.31
Current monkeypox outbreak
Several days after the index case was reported, two laboratory-confirmed and one probable case were identified within the same household on May 13. Four additional confirmed cases were reported among Sexual Health Service attendees (men who have sex with men) presenting with a vesicular rash illness on May 15 in the UK.32 As in the first case, the source of infection could not be identified, and local transmission in the UK was suspected.32 As of May 21, 92 laboratory-confirmed cases and 28 suspected cases of monkeypox were reported in 12 non-endemic countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the USA.28 Although these cases had no direct travel links to an endemic area, many of them were identified among men who have sex with men seeking care in primary care and sexual health clinics.28 A similar finding was reported by other studies.21,23,29,30,33e35 Among 86 monkeypox cases reported during May 7e25 in the UK, only 1 case is known to have a travel history to a monkeypox endemic country; 79 patients were men and 66 of them reported being gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men.30 In Italy, four young adult men were reported to have a condomless sexual intercourse, and seminal fluid samples were positive for monkeypox viral DNA.29 In the USA, one investigation identified 17 cases, and most cases (n Z 16) were gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men.23 Although most current outbreaks occurred in European regions, more and more cases have been reported in the American, African, Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Pacific regions (Fig. 1).12

reported in several Asian countries, including South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan.12 In Taiwan, the first case was a young man who was studying in Germany and developed symptoms on June 20, 4 days after he arrived in Taiwan.36 His symptoms included fever, sore throat, muscle pain, swollen lymph nodes in the groin, and rash. On June 24, 2022, he tested positive for monkeypox, which was reported as a confirmed case. Thus, he was admitted to a negative pressure room and isolated until symptom resolution. Meanwhile, 19 people were listed as close contacts, including 10 medical workers and 2 relatives. Although none developed any symptoms, close observation was required to monitor their health for 21 days following exposure.36
Estimated burden
Bisanzioa et al. established a projected model based on a simulated population of 50 million people with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics typical of a highincome European country. They estimated that the introduction of 300 cases could result in 402 secondary cases without interventions. The median duration of these outbreaks for this scenario would be 37 (95% CI: 19e121) weeks following the introduction of 300 cases.37 Contact tracing with isolation of symptomatic cases would reduce the number of secondary cases by 68.9%. Moreover, adding ring vaccination to contact tracing would further reduce the number of secondary cases by 86.1%.37 This projection of monkeypox burden was compatible with the WHO's risk assessment of overall public health risk at a global level as currently moderate.38

Association between COVID-19 and monkeypox outbreaks
The rise in the number of monkeypox cases during the COVID-19 pandemic makes the situation more complicated. The clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infections are protean, including respiratory and extra-respiratory symptoms.39 COVID-19 may occasionally present with skin manifestations, such as an erythematous maculopapular rash, erythema multiforme, vesicular rash, vascular livedo reticularis, figurate erythema, or a flexural rash.40 Because COVID-19 and atypical monkeypox in the current outbreak may share a similar clinical picture, clinicians should remain alert to these two diseases during this period. In addition, co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses is not uncommon.41 Therefore, the potential for co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and the monkeypox virus cannot be neglected. However, the changes related to infectivity patterns, severity, management, or response to vaccination in one or both diseases are unknown. Therefore, further investigation is warranted to determine the association between COVID-19 and monkeypox outbreaks.
Risk factors
In addition to those who have close contact with patients with monkeypox or contact with an infected animal, immunocompromised patients may also be at risk of acquiring monkeypox.15,42e44 In the current outbreak, a small series of 27 confirmed cases in Portugal found more than half (n Z 14) had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.22 Several studies also reported the development

790

Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection 55 (2022) 787e794

of monkeypox in patients with HIV during this outbreak.45 The main reason could be those HIV cases carry the same risk as men who have sex with men. Moreover, a recent analysis of 124 cases identified several preliminary risk factors, including being a young man, having sex with other men, engaging in risky behaviors and activities such as condomless sex, and HIV positivity.46 Finally, healthcare workers could have a higher risk owing to a longer duration of virus exposure.47
Clinical manifestations
The mean incubation period of monkeypox was 8.5 (95% CI: 4.2e17.3) days.48 Prodromal symptoms of monkeypox include fever, chills, sore throat, cough, headache, myalgia, blepharoconjunctivitis, lethargy, and adenopathy, followed by rashes that usually begin within 1e3 days of symptom onset. The rash typically appears on the face and then becomes generalized with the involvement of the palms and soles. Rashes can also be found in the mouth, genitals, and eyes. These lesions can be flat or slightly raised; filled with clear or yellowish fluid; and then crust, dry, and fall off. The number of skin lesions can range from a few to several thousands. The evolution of rashes is similar to that of smallpox, from macules, to papules, vesicles, pustules and scabs evolving over 2e4 weeks. Skin lesions typically last 2e4 weeks and gradually resolve without treatment. These dermatological characteristics of monkeypox with lymphadenopathy are different from those of chickenpox and smallpox and help clinicians make a differential diagnosis (Table 1). However, the current monkeypox outbreak in 2022 can have atypical features, including (a) only a few or even single lesions or the absence of skin lesions in some cases; (b) lesions mostly located in genital and perianal sites and presenting with anal pain and bleeding; (C) skin lesions restricted to genital, perineal or perianal areas; (D) asynchronous lesions, ranging from single or clustered spots to umbilicated papules with progressive central ulceration, and, finally, to scabs; (E) absence of prodromal symptoms, such as fever, malaise, and headache before the development of a rash; (F) presence of herald skin lesions at the point of sexual contact in some patients (Table 2).11,22,29,46,49

Laboratory diagnosis
Nucleic acid amplification testing can be generic to orthopoxvirus or specific to monkeypoxvirus. Definite diagnosis of monkeypox virus infection requires nucleic acid amplification testing using real-time or conventional PCR for the detection of viral DNA. Skin lesions, including swabs of the lesion surface or exudate, roofs from more than one lesion, or lesion crusts, are recommended clinical specimens for laboratory test. Serological testing for IgG, which may become detectable 8 days after symptom onset, requires paired acute and convalescent sera. Anti-monkeypox virus IgM may be positive within 5 days of presentation. However, antibody detection in plasma or serum should not be used alone to diagnose monkeypox.50,51
Treatment and outcomes
Currently, there is no standard-of-care treatment for monkeypox except supportive care.52,53 Although smallpox antivirals with poxvirus activity, such as cidofovir, brincidofovir, and tecovirimat, are active against the monkeypox virus, these antivirals would most likely be reserved for the treatment of severe cases or immunocompromised persons.53 Additionally, vaccinia immune globulin, a hyperimmune globulin licensed by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States (US FDA) for the treatment of certain complications of vaccinia vaccination, may be recommended for severe cases.53
Monkeypox is usually a self-limiting disease; however, newborns, children, and people with underlying immune deficiencies may be at risk of more serious illness and death.20,46,54,55 Complications from severe cases of monkeypox include skin, pneumonia, altered sensorium, and eye infections that can lead to loss of vision. A systematic review conducted before the current outbreak reported that the overall CFR was approximately 8.7% but CFR was different in different areas, ranging from 0 to 11%. However, this may be overestimated because surveillance in endemic countries is limited.20 In the current outbreak, only one death was reported in Nigeria in the second quarter of 2022, and the estimated CFR was only 0.03% (1/ 3413).11

Prevention and vaccination
Monkeypox can spread to people when they come into physical contact with infected animals. The animal hosts include rodents and primates. The risk of zoonotic transmission can be reduced by avoiding unprotected contact with wild animals, especially those sick or dead (including their meat and blood). In endemic countries, where animals may carry monkeypox, food containing animal meat or parts should be cooked thoroughly before eating.
Individuals with monkeypox are infectious and have symptoms. Rashes, bodily fluids (such as fluid, pus, or blood from skin lesions), and scabs are particularly infectious. Clothing, bedding, towels, or objects such as eating utensils/dishes that have been contaminated with the virus from an infected person can also infect others. Ulcers, lesions, and sores in the mouth can also be infectious, meaning that the virus can spread through saliva and respiratory droplets. Because close physical contact is the primary route for human-to-human transmission, limiting contact with people who have suspected or confirmed monkeypox is the key to prevention. People with multiple sexual partners, including those living with HIV-infected patients, are encouraged to reduce their risk of exposure to monkeypox by avoiding close contact with anyone with symptoms. Reducing the number of sexual partners also reduces the risk of infection.
Healthcare workers who take care of patients with monkeypox should encourage them to self-isolate and cover any skin lesions. A medical mask is essential when physically close to the patient, especially if the patient is coughing or has lesions in the mouth. Avoid skin-to-skin contact whenever possible, and use disposable gloves while directly contacting skin lesions. Hand hygiene with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub is needed, especially after contact with infected people and their clothes, bed sheets, towels, and other items or surfaces they have touched or that might have come into contact with their rash or respiratory secretions. No¨rz et al. examined surfaces in rooms occupied by two monkeypox patients on their fourth hospitalization day. Contamination with up to 105 viral copies/cm2 on inanimate surfaces was detected.56 Regarding the concern of possible fomite transmission,

thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting any potentially contaminated surfaces and disposing contaminated waste are essential.
People vaccinated against smallpox in the past may have some protection against monkeypox and its associated manifestations.57,58 However, original smallpox vaccines are no longer available, and people aged <40e50 years are unlikely to have been vaccinated. The US FDA approved JYNNEOSTM (also known as IMVAMUNE, IMVANEX, MVA-BN) in 2019 to prevent monkeypox in adults aged 18 years at high risk for smallpox or monkeypox.59 In addition, this vaccine has been approved in Europe for smallpox, although the UK has used it off-label in response to monkeypox cases. ACAM2000â, another smallpox vaccine, was licensed by the FDA in August 2007 and has been indicated for active immunization against smallpox disease for persons determined to be at high risk for smallpox infection. Because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has the emergency access to investigational new drugs, it allows the use of ACAM2000â for non-variola Orthopoxvirus infections, such as monkeypox, during an outbreak.60
Given the experience of combating COVID-19, all healthcare authorities are well versed in effectively mitigating an infectious disease.5,61e64 Many infection control and prevention measures have been adopted to contain the current monkeypox outbreak. These policies include early identification of cases, contact tracing, travel and gathering restrictions according to the risk of infection, establishment of an adequate quarantine window, appropriate personal protective equipment provision for healthcare workers, avoidance of stigmatizing messaging circulating online related to monkeypox, and development of effective vaccines and postexposure prophylaxis.65,66
Unknowns
As of July 8, 2022, 9069 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, and most of them are from non-endemic countries (Supplemental Table). This indicates that personto-person transmission occurred, with most cases seemingly unlinked to travel from an endemic country and the appearance of multiple unlinked clusters. This suggests that undetected chains of transmission occurred. Another

unusual characteristic is that many cases of monkeypox are recognized among men who have sex with men. Many of these cases were diagnosed at sexually transmitted infection clinics. The virus may or may not spread sexually in this group and may be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact or respiratory droplets. Another unresolved issue is the cause of this outbreak, which is much larger and more widespread than previous monkeypox outbreaks outside Africa. Studies are underway in affected countries to determine the source of infection for each identified case. Actions were taken to provide medical care and limit the further spread of the disease.
Conclusion
The current monkeypox outbreak has become a new threat during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinicians should be aware of this new situation, which has clinical features different from dermatological diseases with pustular or "pox" lesions (Table 1). Primary care physicians, urgent care physicians, emergency medicine physicians, dermatologists, and those working in sexually transmitted infection clinics may be most likely to encounter new patients with monkeypox should they continue to appear. Global health systems should develop effective strategies to mitigate the spread of monkeypox. However, precedence should be given to containment efforts that should rely on enhanced case finding, case isolation, contact tracing, and vaccination.

ABSTRACT
The wildlife trade is a major cause of species loss and can trigger disease transmission. While the COVID-19 pandemic sparked public interest in eliminating the wildlife trade, a better under­ standing is needed of the economic repercussions of COVID-19 on those who rely on wildlife farming for their livelihoods. Using the case studies of Ba Ria Vung Tau and Binh Duong provinces in Vietnam - a country seen as Asia's wildlife trade hotspot - this paper explores COVID-19's impacts on wildlife farms and their owners. Understanding these impacts is important, both in order to design appropriate interventions to support local people in mitigating COVID-19's im­ pacts as well as to inform effective policymaking around wildlife conservation in Vietnam. In this study, we adopted mixed research methods (including a literature and policy review, stakeholder consultation with government agencies and NGOs engaged in designing and monitoring wildlife conservation policies, a wildlife farming household survey, and research validation workshop) to understand the status of Vietnamese wildlife farms, as well as the impacts of COVID-19, and any opportunities and challenges for wildlife conservation and management in Vietnam. Our paper shows that, across the two studied provinces, numbers of wildlife farms and farmed wildlife animals have both declined since the pandemic, with declining market demand and wildlife farm owners experiencing difficulties accessing markets due to travel restrictions. Although this affected wildlife-related income, this represented less than 30 % of families' overall income on average, and thus households were able to maintain their livelihoods through other sources. Most wildlife is raised as an additional food source for farming families and plays an important role in the diets of surveyed households. Findings also highlighted that most surveyed households' postpandemic recovery strategies involved expanding their wildlife farms in scope and scale; these households perceived a stable domestic market and high prices for wildlife products in future.

Our study found several opportunities for sustainable wildlife farming practices, including greater political commitment, an increasing number of wildlife conservation policies, and stronger law enforcement mechanisms. Challenges remain, however; including an unclear and inconsistent policy framework, the presence of an illegal market, and wildlife farm owners' limited knowledge and understanding of wildlife policies. Our paper also shows a lack of comprehensive data and understanding around actual wildlife transactions during the pandemic, leading to challenges in confirming whether COVID-19 had any real impact on wildlife trade. Further research is required to address this knowledge gap.

1. Introduction
The wildlife trade is a major cause of species loss and is one of the main causes of disease transmission (Liew et al., 2021; Wik­ ramanayake et al., 2021). COVID-19 has thus been seen as an alarm call, raising public and policymakers' awareness and commitment to addressing this challenge (Lin, 2021). Previous studies have found COVID-19 to have multiple and multifaceted impacts on wildlife trading and farming, both positive and negative. The pandemic has led to a decline in financial and human resources devoted to wildlife conservation in many places, posing a significant threat to animal welfare, and challenging government agencies and con­ servation communities alike in the post-pandemic period (Neupane, 2020; Baptista et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2021).
The COVID-19 outbreak also intensified an unsettled debate on whether governments should legalize or criminalize the commercial trade of wildlife (D'cruze et al., 2020; Bennett et al., 2021; Borz´ee et al., 2021). Banning wildlife trade, as China has done, can translate political will to address illegal wildlife farming and trade by strengthening existing monitoring and law enforcement mechanisms and enhancing legislation and regulation around wildlife farming practices, thereby galvanizing rapid, widespread knock-on actions and impacts (Koh et al., 2021). This is necessary to promote improvements in wildlife management, for example updating protected species lists, revising laws, strengthening existing but poorly implemented wildlife policies, and changing consumption behaviors (Yang et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2021).
However, while conservation communities advocate for banning the wildlife trade (Lindsey et al., 2020; Roe et al., 2020), several scholars propose that policymakers and conservationists could take a policy-based approach instead, considering species-specific attributes of biological productivity as well as the management context (Shi et al., 2020; Bennett et al., 2021). This is because a ban might not fully acknowledge and address key drivers of emerging infectious diseases, such as: habitat destruction, which largely driven by agricultural expansion and industrial livestock production (Roe et al., 2020); wildlife consumption and animal-based food systems (Shi and Hu, 2008; Murray et al., 2016); international wildlife trade and crime (Bell et al., 2004); and larger trends of deforestation, defaunation, and environmental exploitation (Gatti, 2020, IPBES, 2020, van Uhm and Zaitch 2021). As COVID-19 has negatively affected local livelihoods (Rahman et al., 2021) and millions worldwide are wildlife-dependent for food security and in­ come (Montgomery and Macdonald, 2020), there is also concern that a wildlife trade ban could undermine human rights and un­ dermine sustainable development longer term (Roe et al., 2020). Scholars highlighting the merits of the wildlife trade, like Yang et al. (2020), Koh et al. (2021) and Xiao et al. (2021), flagged blanket ban weak spots, including how to reduce harm to wildlife farm owners, and ensure policies and measures are in place to support farmers' livelihoods. As wildlife breeding and trade are big businesses, seen by many countries as a poverty reduction tool, solutions must address both conservation and development concerns (You, 2020). Yet limited empirical evidence exists on the pandemic's economic repercussions for those depending on wildlife farming for their live­ lihoods (Mcnamara et al., 2020) to inform such solutions.
This paper's objective is thus to examine impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on wildlife farms and discuss implications for future wildlife policies in Vietnam. Vietnam is an Asian wildlife trade hotspot (Nash, 2019; Dinh, 2020; Nguyen and Dinh, 2020). Reported cases, both of illegal wildlife trading and of wildlife animals being rescued, have increased sharply over the last five years (Vietnam News, 2021; Vietnam News Agency, 2021, VietNamNet Global 2021). And while the government perceives wildlife farming to contribute significantly to local livelihoods and rural development (Nguyen et al., 2007), it also acknowledges the threat illegal wildlife trading poses to degrading national biodiversity. The COVID-19 pandemic has also intensified national debate around wildlife trading, with civil society organizations pressing the government to strengthen policies as they advocate to ban wildlife farming and trading (The Guardian, 2020). On 23 July 2020, the Prime Minister of Vietnam issued Directive 29/CT-TTg, outlining urgent measures to tighten wildlife management; this included suspending wildlife imports, strengthening law enforcement, and stricter local-level monitoring of wildlife farming activities (Prime Minister of Vietnam, 2020). This regulation stirred new hope for conservation communities wishing to reduce the wildlife trade (Nguyen, 2020a), despite concerns about the potential for it to turn into an empty promise (Environmental Investigation Agency, 2020). While various media outlets report the pandemic's limited impact on slowing or reducing wildlife trading activities (Bui and Quan, 2021; Nguyen, 2021b), there is scant scientific evidence to support this; under­ standing these impacts is key, both to design appropriate interventions to support local people to mitigate such impacts, and to inform effective policymaking around wildlife conservation in Vietnam.

2. Methods

2.1. Site selection

We began by reviewing relevant literature to identify areas with large numbers of wildlife farms, before interviewing two central government agencies and three NGOs engaged in designing and monitoring wildlife conservation policies, to identify potential sites and knowledge gaps. From this we identified four potential research sites in the provinces of Thanh Pho Ho Chi Minh, Binh Duong, Ba Ria Vung Tau and Dong Nai. Over 70 % of Vietnamese wildlife farms are in the Southern region (Vietnam News, 2020), and these four provinces see large numbers of wildlife farming activities (Dard, 2007; Nguyen, 2010; Luong, 2018, Pannature, 2020, Le, 2021, Nguyen, 2021a, Sang, 2021). The research team then visited these four provinces to validate reported data, consult stakeholders and obtain research approval. Based on this, the research team chose Binh Duong and Ba Ria Vung Tau as the locations for the study sites. This was partly due to research approval by local government offices. As such, future research in the remaining two provinces would provide a more comprehensive regional overview and ensure site selection has not impacted results; for example, governmental willingness to participate may reflect differing local perspectives, compared with those of locations more reticent to be surveyed.

2.2. Data collection

We reviewed national and provincial policies on wildlife management, as well as reports by government, donor, international NGO and academic bodies, on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and implications for implementing wildlife management policies.
We then interviewed 11 government officers in Binh Duong and 12 government officers in Ba Ria Vung Tau engaged in wildlife policy design and implementation. These interviews aimed to understand the status of Vietnamese wildlife farms, the impacts of COVID-19, and any opportunities and challenges for wildlife conservation and management in these two provinces. These interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a thematic coding approach.
We then conducted a household survey of 92 wildlife farm owners in Ba Ria Vung Tau and Binh Duong provinces to understand local people's perceptions on current policies concerning wildlife conservation and management, as well as COVID-19 impacts (Table 1). These households were randomly selected from the list of total households engaged in wildlife farming activities, as provided by the provincial authorities.

3. Results

3.1. Overview of wildlife farms in Binh Duong and Ba Ria Vung Tau provinces

3.1.1. Binh Duong province Most wildlife farms in this province function for food and economic purposes, operating at household scale with less than five
species per farm, and less than 10 animals in total (Binh Duong government agencies interviewed, and Table 2). The most commonly-raised species (i.e., more than 500 animals) in Binh Duong are Trionyx sinensis (ba ba trn), Crocodylus sia­
mensis (c´a sa^`u nc ngt), Python molurus bivittatus (tran a^`t), Hystrix brachyura (nhím) and Ptyas mucosus (r´an r´ao tr^au). Farmed numbers of all these animals declined significantly between 2016 and 2020 (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2).

3.1.2. Ba Ria Vung Tau province In this province, the most common species raised for economic purposes are Crocodylus siamensis (ca´ sa^`u nc ngt), Rhizomys
pruinosus (dúi), Hystrix brachyura (nhím), Paradoxurus hermaphroditus (cy vo`i hng), Ptyas Muccous (R´an ra´o tr^au), Naja trou (r´an h mang thng), Cervus unicolor (nai) and Phasianus colchicus (Tr  khoang c) (Table 3). Overall, this province has 32 farms with 1681 individuals of more commonly-found forest animals listed in Table 3.
Many farmed species are raised for multiple purposes; however, most are raised for meat, breeding and tourism purposes. Pro­ vincial government officers reported that wildlife trade here targets both domestic and Chinese markets; their belief was that the decline in farm numbers was due to declining demand, mostly from China. Illegal wildlife trading activities and weak compliance with legislation are still widely reported in the province, however (ThienNhien.Net 2020, Phuc, 2021); this could point to another possi­ bility - that wildlife farming has gone underground since the pandemic linked its origins with wildlife trade.

Government officers and households gave two reasons for this: (i) provinces were changing to a new registration system, and previously-registered farms now required licenses and registration numbers to be reissued for IIB group species under Decree 06/2019; and (ii) many wildlife farmers refused to renew their registration as they did not understand why they were suddenly illegal.

government actors also shared challenges in monitoring unlicensed farms, highlighting households' difficulties completing government-required forms. Although 50 % of households in Binh Duong and 96 % in Ba Ria Vung Tau said they were aware of government policies, for example, that they required certificates and licenses from forest rangers to sell wildlife commercially, they had limited understanding of what paperwork they needed to submit to rangers. Just 14 % of households interviewed in each province understood the need to submit records of wildlife origins and proof of human/animal safety standards to obtain their certificates.
In Ba Ria Vung Tau, government officers undertake two annual inspections, mostly focused on rare and endangered species. Government agencies in both provinces highlighted challenges identifying the origins of wildlife specimens, due to poor household recordkeeping and previously-unregulated policies. Weak monitoring and law enforcement, as Ba Ria Vung Tau government officers explained, are also due to insufficient funding for biodiversity assessments and studies, coupled with an outdated database on species and their preferred habitats, both in natural and farmed conditions.

3.2. How the COVID-19 pandemic impacted wildlife farms

3.2.1. Few wildlife farms affected by the pandemic Just 12 % of households interviewed in Ba Ria Vung Tau and 40 % in Binh Duong claimed their businesses had been negatively
impacted by the pandemic. Those who were explained it was because the pandemic meant they were unable to sell their products, as markets closed (25 %), tourists were unable to visit their facilities (25 %), restaurants could not open due to lockdowns (50 %) and there had been increased costs for hiring laborers (75 %), without profit being generated. Households in both provinces shared that many brokers had forced small-scale farms to sell them their wildlife at low cost, so they could make more profit post-pandemic. Lockdowns and stricter wildlife conservation policies meant households were unable to sell wildlife products overseas and to other provinces, so they resorted to trading illegally within their provinces without informing government officers.
However, the majority of households across both provinces (60 % in Binh Duong and 88 % in Ba Ria Vung Tau) claimed the pandemic had a minor impact on them as wildlife farming was not their primary income source (less than 30 % of the household budget); their main income sources were other businesses, like hostel services and restaurants (Fig. 3). These households highlighted that the scale at which they operated was relatively small (less than 10 individual animals), and they mostly supplied domestic, rather than international markets.
The number of surveyed households claiming to be affected in Ba Ria Vung Tau was much less than in Binh Duong province (12 % compared with 40 %). This was for three reasons. First, some survey respondents in Ba Ria Vung Tau had moved to online sales through social media platforms like Zalo and Facebook, meaning they were not seriously affected by COVID-19 lockdowns. Second, as Binh Duong was a COVID-19 hotspot in the South (Phuoc, 2021) its lockdown was longer than that of Ba Ria Vung Tau (Hoang, 2021). Third, most Ba Ria Vung Tau wildlife farmers targeting domestic markets also had restaurants, so they could continue selling meat products during the pandemic; in contrast Binh Duong farm owners rely on selling to other provinces, notably Ho Chi Minh City, which was another COVID-19 hotspot with a lengthy lockdown period.

3.2.2. Slight decline in wildlife farms and farm-raised wildlife animals Differing from Binh Duong, which has robust recordkeeping of wildlife farms over time, Ba Ria Vung Tau province lacks systematic
monitoring and evaluation to show the progressive status of wildlife farms over time. However, available data shows that the number of wildlife farms and the number of species on these farms has slightly reduced in both provinces since COVID-19, with a reduction of more than 55 % in the total number of farm-raised wildlife animals in Ba Ria Vung Tau (Table 4).
While acknowledging the pandemic's partial contribution to the decline in wildlife farms, both central and provincial government interviewees highlighted that this decline was also partly due to the accumulative impacts of a declining Chinese market (which began long before the pandemic), as well as stricter policies and law enforcement around wildlife trading and farm expansion. Although Binh Duong government officers shared that farm owners were no longer informing officials of their wildlife sales since the pandemic, they also acknowledged insufficient data on wildlife trade transactions to confirm their hypothesis. A Ba Ria Vung Tau government officer also added that weak law enforcement around illegal wildlife trade provided little disincentive to prevent local people from committing crimes.

3.3. Opportunities, challenges and post-pandemic strategies for wildlife farmers in Vietnam
3.3.1. Opportunities Reflecting the evolving political context, government agencies in both provinces acknowledged increasing political attention on
wildlife issues. This presents opportunities for provincial government agencies to obtain more central government funding for law enforcement and more international funding to provide technical support around monitoring and capacity building so wildlife farm owners can carry out their farming practices sustainably.
Ba Ria Vung Tau government officers highlighted other opportunities, for example that many involved in wildlife farming activities had extensive knowledge of how to treat diseases and increase the successful breeding of rare and endangered species; knowledge that forest rangers did not have. This could be beneficial in terms of increasing the population of certain rare and endangered species. Interviewed government officers in both provinces also flagged an increasing interest in the opening of eco-resorts, in which companies had large-scale safari areas to raise wildlife, veterinary staff, and operational staff trained in wildlife conservation. Most wildlife farm owners surveyed in Binh Duong and Ba Ria Vung Tau provinces believed this was easy to do, and that it remained easy to sell wildlife because there was stable market demand.
3.3.2. Wildlife farmers' post-pandemic strategies We applied the Chi-square test of independence to test for significant differences in responses, for example perceptions around
future opportunities for wildlife farming and trade, and wildlife farm owners' post-pandemic strategies. Wildlife farm owners' decisions regarding their future in wildlife farming are based on their perceptions of post-pandemic op­
portunities for the wildlife trade (Table 5). Statistically significant differences were noted between Binh Duong and Ba Ria Vung Tau when looking at households' perceptions around future opportunities. In Binh Duong, stakeholders anticipated opportunities for future wildlife farming and trade would include government support to increase the sustainability of wildlife farm practices, and further guidelines and support for wildlife farm owners. Meanwhile, the majority of Ba Ria Vung Tau respondents felt the most significant opportunities were the potential of having sustainable, high income from wildlife farming, and the fact that wildlife farms are already legalized in Vietnam.
These differing responses can be explained by various factors. Most surveyed households in Binh Duong are small-scale operators reliant on government support for technical training and guidance; this has increased over time due to stronger wildlife management policies. Their perceptions of future opportunities are duly influenced by this government support. In contrast, Ba Ria Vung Tau households operate at a larger scale, targeting both domestic and oversea markets; their perceptions of opportunities therefore relate to market opportunities and income potential. According to most stakeholders interviewed, the fact that commercial wildlife farms are legalized provides households with the confidence to invest.

The study also found both similarities and differences between the two provinces in terms of wildlife farm owners' post-pandemic strategies (Table 6). Based on their perceptions, the majority of wildlife farmers in Binh Duong intended to scale down (33.33 %) or maintain their existing farms (21.43 %), while farm owners in Ba Ria Vung Tau were more likely to expand (32.00 %) or maintain their existing farms (52 %); just a few planned to scale down (4.00 %) following the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather than expanding individual numbers of specific species, however, these households planned to increase the overall number of animals raised.
The difference here could be explained by several factors. As wildlife farming households in Binh Duong operate at a smaller scale, most have limited capital to invest in large-scale farming. The pandemic's impact on household income has thus led several households to have weaker capacity and interest in maintaining and expanding their operations. In contrast, many Ba Ria Vung Tau households were able to continue sales of wildlife products in the domestic market, and few were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; expansion is thus seen as strategy to overcome any setbacks experienced due to the pandemic and improve future income.

3.3.3. Challenges Despite this optimism, both households and government agencies highlighted numerous challenges for current and future wildlife
farming practices in Vietnam. In both provinces, 98 % of households were unaware of human and animal diseases associated with farming wildlife animals. An overwhelming majority of Ba Ria Vung Tau households (46 households - 92 %) highlighted their insufficient veterinary knowledge, and 48 households (96 % of households surveyed) in Ba Ria Vung Tau admitted that their knowledge around environmental standards was insufficient to meet national requirements. Surveyed households shared that such knowledge was determined by their access to government programs, ranger support, and social networks among wildlife farmers, all of which varied significantly. In Binh Duong, 27 households (64.3 %) said government agencies proactively guided and supervised wildlife farming activities; this figure was just 4 households (8 %) in Ba Ria Vung Tau. A small number of households surveyed (8 households (16 %) in Ba Ria Vung Tau and 4 households (10 %) in Binh Duong) highlighted the risk of uncertain markets and prices for wildlife products, while others flagged more competition, caused by increasing numbers of new wildlife farms, as a challenge.

4. Discussion

The Government of Vietnam argues that captive breeding and artificial propagation contribute to local income and employment (Nguyen et al., 2007). Wildlife farming continues to prove an economically attractive option for households in our studied sites, with new farms being established even after the COVID-19 pandemic. While previous studies show COVID-19 lockdowns affected the in­ comes of similar wildlife businesses elsewhere in the world (Mcginlay et al., 2020, Abeli Shoo et al., 2021, Cahyadi and Newsome, 2021, Rahman et al., 2021, Spenceley et al., 2021), in Vietnam just a few surveyed wildlife farms believed COVID-19 had seriously affected their businesses; wildlife-related income contributing less than 30 % to most households' income in Ba Ria Vung Tau and Binh Duong provinces. This minor impact has several implications for future wildlife conservation policies.
First, our paper supports previous studies, which highlight that effective wildlife conservation policies and projects need to pri­ oritize the diversification of livelihood options (Cherkaoui et al., 2020; Abeli Shoo et al., 2021; Mcelwee et al., 2020) to reduce financial dependence on wildlife farming. Second, our paper flags a significant data gap when it comes to legal and illegal operations. The current monitoring and evaluation system relies on reported numbers of registered wildlife farms. However, this monitoring indicator does not give a comprehensive understanding of the scope and scale of operations. A reduced number of farms does not necessarily indicate less wildlife farming; such a decline could mean a local shift from offline to online markets, as our study found, or that wildlife farming has become more secretive since the pandemic. This would explain the increasing number of reported violations around illegal trade in Binh Duong province (Dinh, 2019; Le, 2019), and flags the further challenges policymakers now face in monitoring the wildlife trade. When animals are bred for human consumption and local people want to expand the scale of this en­ terprise, this raises a flag of alarm for biodiversity conservation.
Stakeholders' concerns around the government's limited ability to oversee and monitor wildlife farms have led to some conser­ vationists advocating for a wildlife trade ban in Vietnam (Nguyen, 2020b). However, both the banning and sustainable management of wildlife trading remain controversial (Bennett et al., 2021). A ban could reduce the risk of emerging infectious diseases (Aguirre et al., 2020), and prevent the biodiversity destruction that results from wildlife farms `laundering' wild animals to sell onto other farms (Brooks et al., 2010). On the other hand, the fact that some households raise wildlife for food and felt wildlife farming was their best plan post-pandemic highlights that a blanket ban could both be logistically challenging to implement, and negatively impact devel­ opment and human rights (Roe et al., 2020). With farmers determined to expand and maintain their farms to respond to continued demand, our paper shows that addressing the wildlife trade nationally depends on a major shift in global wildlife consumption patterns (Li et al., 2021).
Several studies emphasize that policymakers will need to adopt a participatory approach to decision making, to ensure that future use and trade of wildlife is safe, environmentally sustainable and socially equitable (Booth et al., 2021, 2021). Our paper reveals a critical concern around wildlife farming - farmers' lack of knowledge and awareness around veterinary requirements, animal health and human safety. Households surveyed in both provinces are currently raising diverse species in their farms, with weak understanding around human and animal health implications. Further research is needed to understand how species differences in terms of legality and welfare might impact human health, local incomes and people's responses to government policies.
Our study showed domestic restaurants are a key market for many Vietnamese wildlife farm owners, yet there remains limited understanding around consumer segmentation, with a corresponding lack of appropriate behavioral interventions (Olmedo et al., 2021). Previous studies meanwhile show an influx of coronaviruses from the wildlife supply chain into Vietnamese restaurants, suggesting risk for end-consumers, since this likely underpins zoonotic spillover to people (Huong et al., 2020).

emphasizes the need to increase local access to veterinary services and knowledge on veterinary standards (Gorta´zar and de la Fuente 2020). There are limited studies and analysis to uncover these risks, however, nor policies in place to address them. As well as strengthening policies and law enforcement, government agencies must also conduct awareness campaigns and undertake appropriate policy interventions so as to reduce consumer demand for wildlife products domestically. Rigorous research and impact evaluation on the effectiveness of these campaigns is equally essential (Nuno et al., 2018; Veríssimo and Wan, 2019; Thomas-Walters et al., 2021). For government agencies focused on public health and wildlife, it is critically important to assess diverse wildlife trade situations for the risk of potentially serious zoonotic diseases, so as to inform policy design and ensure appropriate policy interventions (Wikra­ manayake et al., 2021).

5. Conclusion

This paper examined the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Vietnamese wildlife farms, as well as wildlife farm owners' strategies in response to the pandemic. Our findings show that although COVID-19 did affect local incomes, the extent of this impact depended on how diversified household income streams were, the scale of farming operations, and whether farm owners were able to adapt their business models (for example, by moving from offline to online trade). Our paper also highlights some key challenges for implementing a wildlife trade ban, particularly when most wildlife farmers intend to maintain or expand their wildlife farms postpandemic. As many farmers raise wildlife for family food, any future ban would also affect their dietary requirements. A particular challenge for wildlife management in Vietnam is weak understanding among wildlife farmers around wildlife policies, human-animal health risks, and how to implement environmental safeguards and human health measures so as to prevent risks. Addressing these challenges requires policy commitment, as well as participatory decision-making processes and capacity building among wildlife farm owners. Future research is also needed to document both the longer-term impacts of the pandemic on Vietnamese wildlife farms, and how government and farm owners respond to COVID-19 and wildlife conservation policies, so as to inform appropriate policy interventions.

ABSTRACT
The recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a significant and topmost global health challenge of today. SARS-CoV-2 can propagate through several direct or indirect means resulting in its exponential spread in short times. Consequently, finding new research based real-world and feasible solutions to interrupt the spread of pathogenic microorganisms is indispensable. It has been established that this virus can survive on a variety of available surfaces ranging from a few hours to a few days, which has increased the risk of COVID-19 spread to large populations. Currently, available surface disinfectant chemicals provide only a temporary solution and are not recommended to be used in the long run due to their toxicity and irritation. Apart from the urgent development of vaccine and antiviral drugs, there is also a need to design and develop surface disinfectant antiviral coatings for long-term applications even for new variants. The unique physicochemical properties of graphene-based nanomaterials (GBNs) have been widely investigated for antimicrobial applications. However, the research work for their use in antimicrobial surface coatings is minimal. This perspective enlightens the scope of using GBNs as antimicrobial/antiviral surface coatings to reduce the spread of transmittable microorganisms, precisely, SARS-CoV-2. This study attempts to demonstrate the syner­ gistic effect of GBNs and metallic nanoparticles (MNPs), for their potential antiviral applications in the devel­ opment of surface disinfectant coatings. Some proposed mechanisms for the antiviral activity of the graphene family against SARS-CoV-2 has also been explained. It is anticipated that this study will potentially lead to new insights and future trends to develop a framework for further investigation on this research area of pivotal importance to minimize the transmission of current and any future viral outbreaks.

1. Introduction
Despite the tremendous amount of research in virology and the development of hundreds of vaccines, viruses are still the leading cause of infectious diseases in humans [1,2]. It has been found in previous studies that infectious viruses have significantly threatened human health globally and are mostly responsible for both acute and chronic infectious diseases. There has been a sustained multidirectional research switch towards developing and exploring activities in various directions to reduce the horrific and lethal attacks of this new pandemic, "Coro­ navirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). One of the most common

transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2 is through various viral contami­ nated surfaces, which humans frequently expose in everyday life. Touching our mouth, nose, or eyes after touching a surface or object with a virus on it may lead to COVID-19. So, it is imperative to disinfect the surfaces by inactivating the virus immediately to stop its spread [3]. Although many cleaning and disinfectant solutions like 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 0.1 sodium hypochlorite are available in the market, these are temporary solutions and have many reported side ef­ fects [4]. Therefore, the remedial solutions in antiviral coatings with long-term durability with low toxicity should be considered [5].
As compared to conventional disinfection and killing mechanisms,

nanotechnology is a better alternative solution to shrink the COVID-19 spread, particularly in healthcare facilities and public places [6,7]. Graphene-based nanomaterials (GBNs) can be used to develop efficient diagnostic devices, effective personal protective equipment (PPE), 3D printed medical and engineering components and surface protective coatings for SARS-CoV-2. Antiviral nano-coatings can be used to desta­ bilize, disinfect and minimize the survival time on different surfaces [8-10]. From the quantitative analysis of published research articles using the SCOPUS database for searching specific keywords for gra­ phene and antimicrobial activity, as shown in Fig. 1(B), it can be found that there is an incremental rise in this research area, especially in the last few years. From the year 2010, graphene compounds got more importance for investigating applications as antimicrobial agents, pri­ marily focusing on bacteria and viruses [11].
Graphene and its derivatives both show a wide range of antimicro­ bial activity including various types of viruses [9,12-14]. Among these materials, graphene oxide (GO), with the highest negative charge, show a higher affinity for positively charged viruses. It has been investigated that lipid bilayer of feline coronavirus can be adsorbed on GO and reduced GO (rGO) surfaces by electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding [15]. Later on, this binding destroyed the viral membrane, thus confirming the GO efficacy against viruses [12,16]. The negatively charged antiviral materials such as heparin, drugs, and heparan sulfate have also been used to modify the GO surface by conjugation [17], which resulted into the increased affinity of GO with positively charged residues of the viruses [18]. Similarly, modified rGO with sulfate de­ rivatives can wipe out herpes virus strains and orthopox virus [19].

(dealing with graphene applications) has proposed a composite ink using GO and Ag nanoparticles, as an effective virucide that can eradicate the earlier strains of coronavirus by its application on N95 masks and other fabrics for frontline workers [20]. A company known as "G6 Materials" is working on development of air filtration system by incorporating graphene that can be used in of­ fices and warehouses to kill viruses [21]. Another technology using self-sterilized laser-induced graphene (LIG) has been developed for water filters that eliminate viruses and bacteria in water and the same can be employed on masks and heating or air-conditioning system for air filtration to reduce the risk of COVID-19 [22].
A study conducted by Hanaa et al. [23] and Kim et al. [24] suggested that GO can target the mRNA of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) to block the replication of HCV gene. Both GO, and rGO show antiviral properties due to their distinctive single-layer configuration, sharp edges and negatively charged surfaces, whereas, graphite (Gt) and graphite oxide (GtO), show negligible antiviral activity. So, it can be concluded that the presence of various surface functional groups, nanosheet structure and sharp edges all are important features to exhibit antiviral properties [23,

Surfaces and Interfaces 27 (2021) 101460
25]. It is an important research area and the pushing requirement in the current scenario to explore and design efficient antiviral coatings that can disrupt and impede the transmission of these infectious viruses [5].
Innocenzi et al. [26] suggested in his perspective that carbon-based materials along with polyphenol and Ag-NPs composites show good antiviral properties based on single oxygen emission and virus capture mechanism, in which GO interacts with, heparan sulfate of virus and destroy its envelope. Zhong et al. [27] reported using few-layer gra­ phene in face masks coating due to its superhydrophobic properties, which inhibit the adhering of virus-containing aerosols. However, it needs laser treatment and sunlight to make it reusable. Other re­ searchers have explored the use of GBNs in nano-vaccines as drug de­ livery agents, biosensors for diagnostic purposes and antiviral nanocomposites [8,26-31]. Srivastava et al. [27] proposed many gra­ phene family applications in the current pandemic, including graphene-based composites for 3D printing masks and as surface coating materials. Some authors have proposed few mechanisms to demonstrate the extraordinary antimicrobial properties of GBNs [9,16,26,32].
Material safety data do not allow the use of virucidal chemicals as disinfectant sprays due to their toxicity and other adverse effects. It may cause health issues for the skin and lungs depending upon concentration and duration of exposure [33]. The most popular disinfectants used for cleaning and fogging the surfaces are chemicals like sodium hypochlo­ rite and hypochlorous acid, which show corrosive nature for various metallic surfaces and residue is also left behind the surface. Continuous use of these chemicals causes mild to severe irritation to the skin, throat and eyes and are not acceptable for hands cleaning or fogging in the long run [34-36].
This perspective mainly focuses on the use of GBNs for antiviral surface coatings at high-risk areas in hospitals, schools, and public places where the risk of spread is very high. After reviewing the previ­ ously proposed mechanisms for antibacterial properties of GBNs, a novel surface coating has been proposed in the current perspective using GBNs, metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) and some reported non-ionic polymeric materials. The synergistic antimicrobial effect of these ma­ terials can be applied to develop robust antiviral coatings that can be applied in a spray or paint on many surfaces. Previously, the role of GBNs in antiviral surface coatings with various proposed mechanisms and future trends has not been reviewed as an independent topic.
Although vaccines against infectious diseases are estimated to have saved at least 23 million lives between 2011 and 2020 but it still needs much more research to fight for new mutagenic and emerging zoonotic infectious diseases [37]. For the COVID-19, several vaccines have also been launched using global resources. Among these, Pfizer-BioNTech by Pfizer, Inc., and BioNTech, Sputnik-V by Gamaleya Research Institute Russia, Moderna by Moderna TX, Inc; Johnson & Johnson's vaccine by

Janssen Pharmaceuticals Companies of Johnson & Johnson and Oxford AstraZeneca Vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and University of Ox­ ford are the major vaccines which have been used globally [38-40]. However, even after a successful launch of these vaccines still these are not 100% effective and breakthrough infections can be expected [38]. In future no one knows when and where the next pandemic may emerge, so to cope with such types of dilemmas, necessary protocols and pre-planning are necessary and for that purpose, the scientific commu­ nity should work on developing such virucidal surface coatings.
Some global facts and data of SARS CoV-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and current SARS CoV-2 have been compared in Table 1, which shows many common elements.
It has been proved now that this virus infects the human host cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), resulting in COVID-19 disease [57]. The current SARS-CoV-2 shows stronger trans­ mission capacity than the previous SARS virus, but its pathogenicity is similar to MERS-COV [58]. The infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is not only a severe threat for humans with high-risk factors, but it also crippled the world economy of many countries, thus

generating a dramatic economic impact for overall interruption of eco­ nomic activities [57,59].
This study aims to highlight the use of nanomaterials, specifically GBNs as surface coatings, disinfectants, or alternative sanitizing mate­ rials to prevent the spread of microbial infections, mainly from SARSCov-2. It also maps possible solutions using variously studied and po­ tential GBNs based hybrid organic surface coatings to destabilize and inactivate the coronavirus's receptors. The current study will help to design safe and human-friendly virus resisting coatings to counteract the transmission of the COVID-19 and other infectious diseases and contribute to preventing any future viral outbursts. It will undoubtedly enable the readers to weigh up such alternative solutions that are yet to be disclosed. This perspective is an effort to draw the attention of re­ searchers, virologists, chemists, and overall scientific bodies toward developing GBNs antimicrobial surface coatings on practical grounds to ease the remediation of current and any future viral diseases and to augment this innovative approach.
Since the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, in December 2019, there was a flood of publications on hot topics related to safety measures, vaccines and other impacts on society, but very few papers have been found in the literature for the work done on disinfection and killing mechanisms of the virus on various surfaces as shown in Fig. 1(A) [60,61].
2. Propagation and stability of COVID-19 on various surfaces
All viruses, including COVID-19, need a living host for replication. It can stay on most surfaces and enter the host body on contact with these surfaces, which is an alarming situation for frequently touched surfaces to increase COVID-19 spread. The work done by Kampf et al. [62] in­ dicates that this virus can stay for up to 9 days at temperatures above 30 C on some surfaces. The new research explained the variable sur­ vival time of SARS-CoV-2 on various plastic, metals, and wood surfaces. Data from different sources have been compared in Fig. 2, showing the virus's stability on different surfaces using almost similar experimental conditions like temperature and concentration and exposure time as reported by few authors [3,62,63].
It has been suggested that various surfaces in hospitals and public places should be adequately disinfected so that the virus cannot stay activated for more extended periods. Researchers concluded through laser beam guidance experiments that a sneeze could produce almost 100,000 particles in an experiment at Toho University in Japan. These particles can be a potential carrier of thousands of viruses that can be categorized into large vs small droplets or sometimes called droplets vs aerosols [64]. It was observed that lighter aerosols might be airborne for a few hours whereas heavy droplets can fall on the various available surface causing the spread of infection. The pieces of evidence concluded that the disease had been worsened to a pandemic due to the high infection rate occurring via `airborne' aerosols [54,65].
Viruses are more stable on plastic and stainless steel (SS) than on cardboard and copper and the viable virus was detected up to 72 h when exposed to these surfaces. However, Goel et al. [66] has shown that virus is stable in the airborne for up to 3 h but stability increases up to 7 days on surgical masks or stainless-steel surfaces and for up to 4 days on smooth surfaces such as glass, plastic or currency notes [67]. The shortest survival time is observed on copper, where the half-life of the virus is 46 min as compared to plastic, where its half-life is 6 h and 49 min [68]. The virus activity is also dependent upon the environmental conditions and surface temperature. Generally, it has been noted that it is more active at lower temperature and colder surfaces as compared to high temperature and hotter surfaces [69].
3. Antiviral features of graphene derivatives, GO and rGO
Graphene oxide (GO) is the oxidized derivative of a graphene molecule, obtained by acid oxidation of graphite, i.e., it contains oxygen functional groups (hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl, and epoxy) [70,71].

The reduction of GO through the thermal process produces rGO, with lesser oxygen content due to reduced number of functional groups but higher number of electroactive sites as compared to GO [72]. Graphene derivatives showing Unique physico-chemical properties of graphene derivatives (GO and rGO), which are effective for antiviral applications are summarized below:
(i) Lateral Size: The adsorption, dispersion, and sharp edges are hugely affected by the particle size; these properties are, in turn, pivotal in microorganism's physicochemical interaction [73]. The larger the lateral size, the stronger the adsorption ability, which is attributed to the higher surface energies. An investiga­ tive study stated that antimicrobial effects were stronger in as­ sociation with larger-sized GO sheets than with smaller sheets [74]. For example, GO sheet size was found to influence its antimicrobial activity in suspension due to the capacity of larger sheets to completely wrap around the cells and isolate them from their environment [75]. Significant differences were found in the antiviral activities among GO and rGO, which may be attributed to their different nanosheet structures as shown in Fig. 3 (a-b). Mostly GO appears to bigger sized sheets as compared to rGO but it also depends on adopted synthetic method and post treatment.

(ii) Number of Layers: Increase of number of graphene layers in­ crease the thickness, causing a weakened "nano knife" effect, decreased dispersibility, and increased aggregation tendency, resulting in reduced contact between GBNs and microorganisms [74,77]. Both the edges and surface of graphene derivatives play key roles in antimicrobial activity [28,74].
(iii) Cytotoxicity due to negatively charged groups: GO and rGO both contain groups of negative charge elements which are responsible for their antiviral characteristics. However, GO has the highest negative charge, which can have a higher affinity for positively charged viruses [32]. Subsequently, the binding of these graphene-derived materials with viruses can destroy the viral membrane. These groups include mainly hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl, which result into redox reactions between the graphene oxide layer and the viruses due to the physico-chemical process which act as an important parameter in destroying the viruses. It should be noted that GO and rGO have an intrinsic ability to adsorb charged lipids and destroy membranes after association with their aromatic plane [10]. This property has been used to explain GO activity against feline corona- virus [16]. It has been reported that lipid bilayer of feline coronavirus is adsorbed on the surface of GO and rGO through hydrogen bonding and electro­ static interactions. These electrostatic interaction between the

negatively charged groups of GO and the positively charged virus particles blocks viral bindings [78]. Ye et al. [79] reported the antimicrobial and antiviral activity of graphene and its de­ rivatives and its cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the charge density also play a crucial role in the binding and destruction of viruses as it has been demonstrated by Matias Sametband et al. that GO and rGO- SO3 blocked HSV-1 infections, and they believe that the charge density is probably the dominant factor affecting the in­ hibition properties, and GO has higher charge density as compared to rGO however GO and rGO- SO3 have roughly the same charge density [80]. (iv) Particles Shape (sharp edges): An interesting finding demon­ strated that the sharp edges of GO nanowalls (GONWs) and rGO nanowalls (rGNWs) significantly decreased the rate of survival of both bacteria and viruses [81]. Experimental evidences show that the sharp edges of GONWs and rGNWs inactivate the virus before it enters the cells and these sharp edges of graphene layers inactivate the attack of viruses through direct association with outer layer leading to destruction of Viral Morphology and viral function [32]. These sharp edges are actually irregular nano-walls of GO and rGO layers, which may also develop due to the presence of dangling bonds, representing at least two times greater reactivity in comparison with the basal plane [78,82]. (v) Surface Modifications/surface functionalization: Modification of graphene's surface or edge characteristics via covalent and noncovalent modulation has been found to play a key role in pre­ venting particle agglomeration and, consequently, influencing their antimicrobial activities [82,83]. It has been found that graphene-based surfaces both GO and rGO can improve the antiviral surfaces and coatings due to their antifouling properties for microorganisms including corona virus when used with different functional materials (i.e. silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), metal oxides and polymers) [78]. Similarly, rGO modified with sulfate derivatives effectively ex- terminate herpesvirus strains, swine fever, and orthopoxvirus [12,19]. Functionalized graphene materials can prevent cellular viral infections based on the interaction between negatively charged functional groups which imitate the cell surface heparan sulfate [19]. It has been reported that the flake sizes of around 300 nm along with around 10% functionalization could provide the optimum performance against viruses [18]. (vi) Agglomeration and Dispersion: Agglomeration weakens the dis­ persibility and adsorption capacity, which alters blade efficacy and consequently reduces their interaction with the microor­ ganisms [74]. However, these properties differ among the different forms of graphene, with GO dispersion exhibiting the most potent antimicrobial activity followed by rGO, graphite (Gt), and graphite oxide, successively [84]. The proper dispersion of GO results in thin sheets of this nanomaterial which is capable of easily wrapping the viruses and bacteria, whereas rGO exhibits aggregate formation and reduced impact when it is not fully exfoliated [74].
4. Graphene and MNPs as antimicrobial agents in surface coatings
Essential interventions to block the spreading of the pathogens through various means include proper diagnosis coverage, digital con­ tact tracing, disinfection, sanitization, social distancing, and population immunization against the pathogen. Research on nanomaterials to explore their antiviral activities against viruses by different mechanisms makes them attractive for viral treatments [55]. Nanomaterial has shown antimicrobial properties due to their unique physical and chemical properties, which can be further customized to provide solu­ tions in the current pandemic. These advanced materials can play a crucial role in multiple directions to defeat the pandemic [28,85]. For

example, nanosystems with antiviral activity can work on binding and destruction mechanisms directly by surface contact or on receiving any external stimulus [31].
While focussing the current pandemic, it has been found that contaminated surfaces are the second main cause for the virus spread [45]. So, sterilization of frequently used surfaces like doorknobs, elevator buttons, handrails in the public area and hospitals should be done to block the transmission. Currently employed surface disinfectant chemicals like sodium hypochlorite (bleach), hydrogen peroxide or alcohol are temporary measures until the next exposure to the virus and also poisonous and irritants when overused for a prolonged time [36, 86]. Novel surface coatings can be formulated and designed by using GBNs, MNPs and some sulfonated polymers to overcome the current challenge. These coatings offer long-term antimicrobial activity against germs when applied or sprayed on frequently touched surfaces [4,13, 31]. Based on the graphene family's unique physical and chemical as­ pects and high surface area, their antimicrobial ability has also been extended to viruses [87,88]. The antimicrobial mechanism of graphene materials is still debatable among the scientific community; however, few possibilities have been explained based on some experimental evi­ dence [89-91].
Three main mechanisms have been proposed for the working of antimicrobial surfaces, which include (i) anti-biofouling mechanism, (ii) release killing mechanism, and (iii) contact killing mechanism, as shown in Fig. 4. Anti-biofouling mechanism repels microbes and prevents them from adhering to the surface which is due to customized super­ hydrophobic properties in case of GBNs. In release killing mechanism, antimicrobial agents and reactive oxygen species are produced near the surface which causes cytoplasmic efflux, decreases metabolism, affects lipid membrane, induces oxidative stress and finally causes microbial death. In the contact killing mechanism, sharp edges or nano-knives of GBNs due to their single or few layer structure play their role in the nearsurface to kill the incoming microbes and instantly damaging the mi­ crobial agents if adhered to the surface [25,66,92].
It has been reported that the antimicrobial action of copper nano­ particles is due to their oxidative behavior and the solubility properties of its oxides [93]. It was observed by Sametband et al. [80] that even small concentrations of partially reduced sulfonated GO (rGO-SO3) and GO could deactivate herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) infection. Some au­ thors have analyzed the interaction between bacteria and GBNs con­ taining surfaces [94-97]. Similarly, graphene-WO2 composite thin film has also been applied in the photo-inhibition of viruses [98]. Another study performed by Hu et al. [99] investigated GO functioned aptamer, a new photocatalyst that destructed the virus proteins capsid and nucleic acids under irradiation. Furthermore, GO, and copper composite mate­ rials can be used effectively for the surface disinfection and inactivation of viruses to prevent further propagation [66]. Few graphene-based composite coatings showing antimicrobial activity have been reported by deposition on titanium, stainless steel (SS) [81] and copper (Cu) [100]. The graphene's biocidal activity varies with the surface as for SS, it is 95% and reduced to 34% when Cu is used [101]. From the discus­ sion above, it has become clear that GBNs and some other MNPs find great potential in antiviral applications in various fields, mainly due to the availability of more surface-active sites, excellent chemical stability and conductivity [102,103]. These magnificent features allow these materials to be applied in many other antimicrobial fields such as water disinfection, wound disinfection, dental care, and treatment.
5. GBNs based antimicrobial surface coatings
Keeping in view the discussion in Section 3 about the stability of the coronavirus on various surfaces, it becomes imperative to work on longlasting antiviral surface coatings that could minimize the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Developing surface protective coatings with excellent antiviral properties for diverse surfaces can help to break the chain of COVID-19. Graphene-based surface coatings with proven antimicrobial

metals can play a vital role to inactivate or reduce the survival time of SARS-CoV-2 on many surfaces. Some reported composites include single-layer graphene (SLG)/multilayer graphene (MLG)-copper com­ posite, SLG/MLG-silver composite, GO-copper composite, GO-silver composite and many other combinations [16,104,105]. High-performance coatings can be developed by varying the concen­ tration of metal nanoparticles to effectively destabilize and minimize the survival time of SARS-CoV-2 on high contact surfaces, i.e., medical and surgical equipment, PPEs and hospital door handles, etc. [8,106].
Xu et al. [107] used poly m-aminophenol (PmAP)-deposited gra­ phene oxide (GO) coatings, fabricated on metal surfaces which work both for microbial and corrosion prevention. GO, and its derivatives have been extensively studied for their antimicrobial properties based on their higher surface area and unique physical and chemical proper­ ties. Its unique characteristics, like single-layer structure and negative surface charge, are mainly responsible for antiviral effects [29,108,109]. From the previous study, it has been found that the graphene family shows significant antiviral activity for a broad range of viruses belonging to different virus families, as shown in Table 2. From this data, it can be found that graphene can be used as independent material or in composite form using MNPs and some selected polymers for antiviral applications.
Issues of poor solubility and processing of GO hinder the fabrication of antimicrobial coatings because of strong interplanar interactions. To alleviate this problem, polymer matrices like polyethylene glycol or amine containing molecules are incorporated in graphene for surface modifications [25,123]. Other metallic nanomaterials such as Au, Ag, Cu, Pd, Pt,Ni, TiO2, ZnO, MnO2, Fe3O4, Co3O4, carbon radicals (·C), and

quantum dots are also reinforced into graphene-based compounds to improve functionalization and synergistic antimicrobial effects [124-126].
A study conducted by Ye et al. [29] uncovered the role of ionic character of GO for its antiviral action against two RNA viruses namely, PEDV (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, a member of corona family) and PRV (pseudorabies virus). Polymer composites of GO with poly (dia­ llyldimethylammonium chloride) (GO-PDDA), and poly­ vinylpyrrolidone (GO-PVP) have been investigated for antiviral activity. It was observed that GO-PVP shows antiviral activity due to nonionic nature of PVP, whereas cationic PDDA shows no antiviral activity. It has been proved through this study that GO shows antiviral properties against both RNA and DNA viruses which were later confirmed by Western blot analysis, plaque formation and indirect immunofluores­ cence assays. As shown in Fig. 5 (A & B) that in the absence of GO, the cell cultures show typical cytopathic effects whereas on GO treated cultures, the plaque formation unit (pfu) has been drastically reduced from 5 × 107 pfu/mL to 2.5 × 105 pfu/mL which also confirmed the antiviral nature of GO [29]. It was also concluded that these materials' broad-spectrum antiviral activity also depends on their concentration and time of exposure. Based on the current discussion, it can be sum­ marized that both GO and rGO practice almost same antiviral mecha­ nism, which may be credited to their negative surface charge and nanosheet structure [26,31]. The mechanism of cell membrane rupture through charge transfer has been explained well by Li et al. [127] as shown in Fig. 5(C). Membrane destruction of bacterial cells can be observed for cells seeded onto graphene-Cu and graphene-Ge except for graphene-SiO2, where no antibacterial activity was seen, which shows

that not all graphene composites can damage the bacteria. Palestino et al. [31] studied the antiviral activity of the graphene
family and found the order as: GO  rGO > GO-PVP > Graphite Oxide (GtO). The authors have also established a linkage of nanosheet struc­ ture with the antiviral activity of these materials. It was found that graphite had no nanosheet structure, so it does not exhibit antiviral properties, whereas GtO, GO, and rGO show antiviral properties due to their nanosheet structures. Due to GO nanosheets, amphiphilic proper­ ties, partial hydrophobic surfaces and some hydrophilic spots show more interaction to the microorganisms. These properties can also be tuned using polymeric material and MNPs to get more chances for sur­ face modification to design better bactericidal coatings [23,90,128].
It can be concluded that negatively charged layered GO having sharp edges can play a vital role in virus interaction followed by inactivation. There are electrostatic interactions that become effective, resulting in disruption of the outer protein layer of viruses releasing RNA and the same phenomenon works for antiviral applications in surface coatings.
6. Mechanism of action of GBNs against viruses
Various proposed mechanisms have explained the antimicrobial ac­ tivity of GBNs. Mainly three mechanisms are extensively reported in the literature: production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress at the membrane, and phospholipids [84,129,130]. Some other reported mechanisms are the physical interaction of graphene's sharp edges with microbial membranes, photo-thermal ablation, and mechanical wrap­ ping, leading to cell lysis [131,132]. There are three stages of antimi­ crobial action of graphene (i) deposition of virus onto the graphene material, (ii) membrane stress by direct contact with sharp nanosheets, and (iii) superoxide anion-independent oxidation [133]. Some re­ searchers mentioned two main mechanisms for the germicidal nature of graphene sheets, i.e. physical disruption [81,134] and oxidative stress [135,136]. Previous studies have demonstrated that GBNs can penetrate the cell membrane for physical disruption and rupture [134,137]. The study conducted by Akhavan and Ghaderi [81] concluded that when GO nanosheets were coated on stainless steel, destruction of E. coli or S. aureus membranes occurred mainly due to the direct contact of the bacteria with extremely sharp edges of the nanowalls [137]. So, sharp edges play a significant role in the mechanical damage of bacteria cells as smooth surfaces cannot physically disrupt the cell membrane.
The oxidative stress mechanism generates ROS, which can damage

the macromolecules like DNA and RNA, protein, and lipid bilayer of microorganisms. In the first step of the mechanism, virus envelope damage starts from the GO's interactions with the outer wall, which can lead to excessive ROS generation and virus inactivation [131]. Physi­ cochemical features and alterations in GO sheets, e.g., sheet size and attached functional groups, may also have a diverse effect when employed on a surface. The bactericidal activity of GBNs has been criticized by Hegeb et al. due to unclarified effect of the physicochemical features like shape, size, hydrophilicity, roughness and functionality of these materials on their antibacterial activity, but the same can be justified based on variations in the physicochemical properties for in­ dividual samples [23].
Generally, two approaches have been investigated to understand the inactivation mechanism of enveloped viruses, which include physical interaction and incorporation of additional features. Physical interac­ tion is based on the interaction between the outer S-protein layer of a virus and the surface of the nanosystem to inhibit the virus activity directly. The antiviral function of GBNs is dependent upon their physi­ cochemical properties. On the other hand, the second approach focuses on developing additional features on nanosystems' surface to kill the virus completely. Synergised action of both methods can be sufficient to fight against SARS-CoV-2. The first approach is preferable as various functional groups can be introduced in graphene oxide, binding with these viruses and inactivating them. For binding and entering of viruses into the host cell, the virus must first interact with the host cell surface receptors. It has been reported by Song et al. [15] that GO was able to efficiently destroy the coating proteins available on corona viruses and extracting the viral RNA in an aqueous environment due to the presence of hydroxyls, epoxides, diols, ketones, or carboxylic functional groups located on its surface. Furthermore, viral envelope glycoproteins, hep­ aran sulfate proteoglycans and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans func­ tion as the cell surface receptors and the functionalized GBNs having negatively charged functional groups can mimic cell surface heparan sulfate [19]. Still, these efforts are mainly restricted to proof-of-concept scenarios; however, some limited reports proposed the application of nanosystems on surfaces, personal protection equipment, and water purification. Based on these mechanisms, it has been proposed that graphene-based nanomaterials can be effectively used for antiviral ap­ plications [26,31,138].
A schematic representation is given in Fig. 6(A) depicts various graphene derivatives' possible interactions with SARS-CoV-2.

Identification of interaction between GBNs and viruses can help develop versatile graphene-based products in nanoparticles, nano surface cleaner wipes, nano-spray, nano-drugs, PPEs, and air filters to encounter COVID-19 [12]. The electroconductive properties of graphene and its derivatives also play an essential role in their interaction with many

biomolecules. Another molecular mechanism between the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and nanoelectromechanical materials such as graphene and graphene-derivatives can be proposed to block virus interaction with human Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) [12]. GBNs can be applied as antiviral surface coatings either themselves or in combination

with metal nanoparticles or polymers. The various mechanisms that have been reported or proposed in the literature include oxidative stress, contact killing, bounce back mechanism, electrostatic interactions, polymer contact killing, wrap killing, ionic interactions. All these mechanisms have been demonstrated in schematic form in Fig. 6(B), which shows the interaction and inactivation/killing of SARS-CoV-2 viruses on graphene-based coatings. These coatings can be applied on various surfaces like face masks, doorknobs, handrails, and elevator buttons etc. Such type of potential graphene-based virucidal approach can be proved as an economical and efficient remedy against COVID-19.
7. Current progress and way forward
Unfortunately, fully 100%, effective antiviral drug and vaccine is not available, and this situation has triggered the scientific community to sought out any alternative critical potential interventions to fight against COVID-19. According to a WHO's statistical surveillance report, following the prevention and control guidelines for using surface dis­ infectants, hand sanitizer and personal protective equipment (PPE) can result in a 30% reduction in healthcare-associated infections [86]. Smart and modern technologies, especially exploiting emerging nanotech­ nology, could help manage the current and future outbreaks. As already discussed, GBNs, particularly GO and rGO exhibit antimicrobial prop­ erties, but due to agglomeration problems, metal ions/oxides in the form of nanoparticles (NPs) have been incorporated to modify the surface properties and antimicrobial action.
A few studies have reported the antiviral activity of fully dispersed GO sheets and found that GBNs can prevent the entry of DNA virus (herpesvirus) and RNA virus (coronavirus) in their target cells [29,80, 139]. Various inorganic MNPs (Ag, Au, Zn, Ge, Si, Cu) have been suc­ cessfully used to enhance the antimicrobial effect of GBNs due to their photocatalytic properties and production of ROS [140]. It has been suggested that GO-based virucidal mist spray can be used to clean any object's surface and even for sanitization of the human body. The mist spray can be formulated as nasal or mouth spray to block the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, especially at the entry points. Interestingly, graphene-coated surface cleaner wipes can better disinfect the infected area [12]. A company (GrapheneCA) has formulated a graphene-based antimicrobial coating that can be applied in the form of paints and varnishes to walls and surfaces of public use that are high-risk areas like shopping malls, metro stations, airports and hospitals. The coating will act to inactivate the outer surface of microorganisms on physical contact [141]. Nano-coatings using N9 blue silver and zinc based nano­ complexes have been used for their synergistic effect as antimicrobial nano-coatings. These nano-coatings are found very convincing and can work on multiple levels simultaneously as antiviral, antibacterial, anti­ fungal and self-cleaning [142-144]. A company named nanoSeptic introduced a nano touch product using mineral nanocrystals charged by any visible light and proved for the breakdown of organic contaminants, including coronavirus envelope using oxidation reaction [110]. Simi­ larly, another Italian company, Nanotech Surface, presented some self-sterilizing and self-cleaning nanosheets using silver and titanium oxide, which can be used on buildings and other surfaces. The company has claimed that the surface remains effective against pathogenic or­ ganisms, including coronavirus, from 6 to 24 months [145].
The antimicrobial properties of graphene sheets depend upon the size, number of layers and oxygen functionality. Due to the presence of reactive surface groups, it can be customized for their antimicrobial activity by decorating with various nanometals and other organic and inorganic compounds having antimicrobial action [89]. It has been found that silver-NPs show antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antiviral activities [146]. These investigations show that GO-Ag-NPs can be used for the fabrication of coatings against SARS-CoV-2. GO sheets play a dual function, first as a supporting and stabilizing media to pre­ vent the agglomeration of Ag-NPs and secondly enhancing the antimi­ crobial activity due to its inherent functional groups, negative charge

and sharp edges [139]. Graphene derivatives with active MNPs such as Au and Ag can interact with cysteine-sensitive molecules active com­ ponents of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As graphene also shows excellent op­ tical properties, based on this phenomenon, it is possible to fabricate graphene and MNPs coated masks and special clothes to detect and prevent virus by changing their color. This theory is presented based on recent research showing the sustainability of this virus in the air for more than three hours, and its aerosol particle has supported movement up to eight meters [55].
There are some limitations and challenges while using GBNs in antiviral applications. Nanotoxicity is a major limitation. Although toxicity of graphene is still a matter of debate however, a few researchers have already found the evidence of their toxic effects [147,148]. Im­ mediate use of graphene for antiviral surface coatings looks difficult due to insufficient data and still more research is needed. Graphene based nano materials can cross biological barriers due to their nano size however these are less cytotoxic as compared to other carbon nano­ materials. There are also limitations related to costs and processing of such type of coatings at different surfaces. Furthermore problems asso­ ciated with accuracy, repeatability, specificity, and sensitivity, can be faced due to the high genetic variability of several viruses [28]. After devising appropriate solutions for toxic concerns such as preparation of hybrid coatings with eco-friendly nanomaterials and MNPs can reduce their minor toxic effects. These materials can be produced in a cost-effective way using waste biomass to further reduce the processing costs [149,150]. GBNs can be combined with green technology using hybrid nanotechnologies for their synthesis, use, storage, recycle and environmental-friendly disposal [28]. Graphene materials possess su­ perior mechanical, thermal and chemical properties and show high resistance to harsh environmental conditions [89,151]. These can be used to develop robust antiviral coatings that can be used at various environmental conditions without affecting their performance and life span. Further experimental work is required in this area that can smoothen the way towards the development of safe and cheaper anti­ viral coatings.
The investigation of the antiviral properties and utilization of carbon nanomaterials or GBNs is yet a new research field, and further study is required to evaluate the potential benefits in this area. However, carbon nanomaterials can be used to make antiviral systems having reduced toxicity and human friendly. A complete assessment of cytotoxicity is the main problem for allowing the development of antiviral applications for such type of materials. The current pandemic has already taught us some important lessons to consider in terms of future antiviral material development. Due to the evolution of unpredictable bacterial and viral infections, there is a dire need to highlight the future research areas for a precise assessment of the antimicrobial activity of the different forms of graphene-based materials for targeted applications. There is an urgent requirement to identify and develop possible treatments and approaches to block S-protein or exterminate the SARS-CoV-2 after its access to the human body. Current analysis suggested the possible use of GBNs to combat the spread of this disease through contaminated surfaces, spe­ cifically focussing the antiviral surface coatings.
8. Concluding remarks
Scientists and researchers worldwide are racing against the time to develop a highly effective and accessible vaccine or any antiviral med­ icine for the treatment of COVID-19. It has been noted that very recently, few vaccines showing good effectivity against SARS-CoV-2 have been disclosed by some companies. However, there are still many challenging issues such as scalability, manufacturing costs, accessibility, intellectual and regulatory property issues, cytotoxicity, and environmental impacts before these vaccines can be safely marketed. It has been shown in the current perspective that GBNs find great potential as antimicrobial agents against pathogens. Among these materials, GO, and rGO showed excellent antimicrobial activity in combination with other organic and

inorganic moieties. Virus-contaminated surfaces are the second major source of transmission. Hence, there is a strong demand for long-lasting and robust antiviral coatings that can be sprayed or painted on frequently used surfaces in hospitals, homes and public areas to restrain viral transmission. It has been proposed that GBNs and some activated MNPs can be used as long-lasting antiviral coatings to obstruct the spread of the current pandemic. These universal virucidal coatings can be applied for wide range of applications, not only against the corona­ virus platforms but also against any other future viruses and microbial agents. Similarly, self-disinfecting and reusable PPEs can also be smartly designed using these advanced materials, which may include face masks, protective clothing, and gloves.
Further research in this field is required to understand and find more possible mechanisms of action of GBNs having antiviral characteristics. New nanomaterials can be explored for the development of multipur­ pose efficient disinfection systems that can be applied on permanent basis having self-reactivation mechanisms. It has been proposed that new flexible and reusable GO incorporated cotton fabrics can be designed as a new antimicrobial material for many medical-related ap­ plications. Similarly, for antiviral drugs and vaccines, nano-vaccines can be developed where graphene material act as inactive Virus-Like Parti­ cles (VLPs). Multifunctional antimicrobial GBNs can prove as ideal products for environmental pollution protection, wastewater treatment, food safety and any other application where control of bacteria, fungi, and viruses is required. So, it is the pressing need of time to identify the long-term and short-term approaches that can be fully employed to cope with the current and any future unforeseen outbreak. Multidirectional long-term actions are required before the emergence of any new bio­ logical threat in the form of a pandemic in future that can affect the people globally and make it challenging to create a bio-secure environment.

Extension of Tablo TrEatmeNt Duration (XTEND) study: successful 24 h prolonged therapy with Tablo in critical patients
Tahir Zaman1, Kasadi Moore1, Jennifer Jellerson1, Yaadveer Chahal2, Joshua Schumacher2, Cynthia DalessandriSilva2* and Michael Aragon2

Abstract Background: The Tablo® Hemodialysis System (Tablo) is an all in one, easy-to-learn device featuring integrated water purification, on demand dialysate production and two-way wireless data transmission and is approved for use in the acute, chronic, and home settings. Prior reports have demonstrated Tablo's ability to achieve clinical goals, seamlessly integrate into hospitals and reduce cost across a wide range of treatment times. Extension of the Tablo cartridge to 24 h allows prolonged therapy and even greater flexibility for prescribers in the acute setting. The objective is to report on the first ever experience with Tablo prolonged therapy between 12 and 24 h in critically ill patients treated at a single-center ICU.
Methods: Nursing staff were trained during a single training session on Tablo prolonged therapy. After a run-in period of five treatments, Tablo data were collected via real-time transmission to a cloud-based, HIPAA compliant platform and reviewed by site staff. Dialysis treatment delivery, clinically significant alarms, and clotting events were recorded. Sub-group analysis between COVID-19 positive and negative patients were reported.
Results: One hundred (100) consecutive Tablo prolonged treatments had a median prescribed treatment time of 24 h and a median achieved treatment time of 21.3 h. Median cartridge usage was 1.3 per treatment. The dialysis treatment time was delivered in 91% of treatments, with 6% ending early due to an alarm, and 3% ending due to clotting.
Clinically significant alarms occurred at a median rate of 0.5 per treatment hour with a resolution time of 18 s. Median blood pump stoppage time related to these alarms was 2.3 min per treatment. Blood pump stoppage time was higher in the COVID-19 subgroup when compared to the non-COVID-19 subgroup.
Conclusion: Tablo successfully achieves prescribed treatment time with minimal therapy interruptions from alarms or cartridge changes. This data demonstrates the effectiveness of Tablo in achieving personalization of treatments necessary for unstable patients and enabling successful delivery of extended therapy with minimal clotting. Tablo's prolonged therapy meets the needs of critically patients, including COVID-19 positive patients, requiring renal replacement therapy for greater than 12 h.

unit (ICU) [1, 2]. AKI occurs in up to half of all patients admitted to the ICU, and of these patients, 4-13% require RRT [1, 3]. While there are various RRT modalities available, including continuous, prolonged, and intermittent, meta-analyses have demonstrated minimal differences in clinical outcomes between these modalities [4]. However, ICU clinicians typically favor treatments of greater than 12 h for hemodynamically unstable patients [5-7], as they allow for more gradual fluid removal and solute clearance over the course of the treatments [5, 8].
The same severe illness that leads to the need for a prolonged therapy often results in organ failure beyond AKI; further complicating the treatment regimen with other critical lifesaving devices, such as mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy, that can lead to interdevice interaction and competition for vascular access [9, 10]. Prolonged therapy is frequently administered concurrently with ECMO, either independently or integrated into the circuit, to mitigate hemodynamic instability and fluid imbalance [11] presenting a highly complex and labor-intensive treatment regimen.
The acuity of these patients, combined with the increased treatment time and slower blood flow rate, adds complexity to the effective delivery of prolonged therapies. The most common complication is associated with circuit clotting or clogging. Clotting in the filter or extracorporeal circuit may be exacerbated by compromised or inadequate vascular access [12]. Poor catheter function may trigger arterial and venous pressure alarms which stagnate extracorporeal blood flow, leading to increased blood pump stoppage that exacerbate clotting events [5, 13]. During the pandemic, the risk of clotting or clogging the circuit during prolonged therapies was further increased in COVID-19 positive patients with AKI due to the prothrombotic state induced by the disease process [14]. Clotting and clogging of the extracorporeal circuit can have significant impact on the ability to achieve ultrafiltration and metabolic clearance targets due to treatment interruptions. In addition to the risk of failing to achieve clinical goals, these interruptions drive up the cost of care due to increased supply utilization from repeated system set up [15], and create additional work for an already highly burdened critical care nursing staff [16].
Taken together and compounded by the staffing shortages that have resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a critical need for simple, flexible RRT technology that can deliver effective therapy with minimal treatment interruption. The Tablo® Hemodialysis System ("Tablo" or "Tablo System") is a novel FDA approved allin-one system capable of purifying water and producing dialysate on demand in any environment, from the ICU

to home. It consists of a console and a single use, disposable extracorporeal circuit (the Tablo Cartridge) for hemodialysis. Tablo is compatible with most commercially available high-flux dialyzers and can perform hemodialysis, isolated ultrafiltration, or sequential, mixed-mode treatments without the need for external water purification devices or sterile bags of dialysate.
Tablo can deliver dialysis therapy across a wide range of blood and dialysate flow rates on a single cartridge up to 24 h. The aim of the Extension of Tablo Treatment Duration ("XTEND") study was to provide the first ever report of treatment experience, cartridge utilization, and clotting events in critically ill patients prescribed treatments between 12 and 24 h using the Tablo System.
Materials and methods
Study design and patient eligibility An observational, retrospective, post-market study was conducted at St. Mark's Hospital (Salt Lake City, UT, USA) over a 9-month period between January 2021 and September 2021 to report on the first 100 consecutive treatments performed beyond 12 h on the Tablo system. The study was reviewed and approved by the Advarra Institutional Review Board (IRB) as the IRB of record (Pro00049220). In accordance with IRB guidance, a waiver of informed consent was granted, as the standard of care encompasses the study intervention. Hospital staff underwent standard training performed by Outset Medical, Inc. ("Outset") personnel on prescribing, setup and management of the Tablo console.
After an initial run-in period at the facility of five Tablo treatments greater than 12 h, all consecutive treatments were screened for eligibility. All patients who were hospitalized in the ICU with ESKD or AKI and requiring dialysis were screened for eligibility. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients who weighed 34 kgs or greater and were prescribed RRT for greater than 12 h utilizing Tablo.
Procedures and data collection Demographic information, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores [17, 18], and clinical data was obtained from each patient's electronic medical records. Prescribed and actual Tablo treatment parameters were collected through real-time transmission to the TabloDash online resource (a cloud-based, HIPAA compliant platform hosted by Outset). All other data including treatment duration, blood pump stoppage time, alarm time to resolution, and total number of cartridges used per treatment were obtained from device sensor data or from Tablo's automated electronic flowsheets and reports. The delivered dose of RRT was calculated by

Zaman et al. BMC Nephrology (2022) 23:338

total effluent volume (L), per hour of actual treatment time achieved, per patient unit weight (kg).
Clinically significant alarms were defined as high or low venous or arterial pressure, low systolic blood pressure, air in the venous bloodline and dialyzer blood leak alarms. Any additional alarm(s) that led the device to direct to end treatment to ensure patient safety were categorized as "Additional Safety Alarms" (e.g., dialysate conductivity alarm).
Treatment outcome determination was performed by hospital nursing staff and were grouped into one of three categories: 1) dialysis treatment time delivered; 2) ended due to an alarm; or 3) ended due to clotting. Dialysis treatment time delivered was defined as those treatments that achieved at least 90% of the prescribed treatment time or delivery of treatments that achieved less than 90% of the prescribed time but were deemed sufficient by clinicians at the site such that re-initiation of treatment was not clinically indicated. Treatments ending due to an alarm included both user and device-directed end treatments where additional setup and same day re-initiation of dialysis treatment was required. Treatments that ended due to clotting were defined as those ended early with documented visual confirmation of clotting within the extracorporeal circuit by the treating nurse.
Descriptive statistics were used to describe study results. For continuous variables, median, mean, standard deviation (SD), and range values were obtained. For categorical variables, percentage proportions were calculated by dividing the number of events by the total number of patients or treatments.
Results
Patient characteristics and baseline data A total of 100 consecutive prolonged Tablo treatments in 33 critically ill patients were analyzed and included in the analysis. Twenty-six COVID-19 negative patients received 74 treatments ("non-COVID-19"). Seven COVID-19 positive patients received 13 treatments ("COVID-19"), and one COVID-19 positive patient undergoing concurrent ECMO therapy ("COVID19+ECMO") received 13 treatments.
Given the impact of COVID-19 positivity on clotting, data was analyzed as a comparison of patients testing positive or negative for COVID-19. The COVID19+ECMO patient was analyzed separately as an outlier due to the potential skew of treatment results associated with the delivery of dialysis and ECMO within a single circuit. Data for this patient is presented at the end of the results section.
The median patient age was 55 years with a mean weight of 109 kg and SOFA score of 13. Most patients

were female (56%), white (69%), and had a non-cuffed temporary catheter placed for RRT access (94%). Aggregate baseline demographics for the 32 non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients are presented in Table 1.
One patient was admitted twice during the period of observation and is represented in both the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups. The initial hospital admission required Tablo therapy of greater than 12 h in the ICU for non-COVID-19 related illness during which the patient tested negative for the virus. The patient was readmitted into the ICU five months later, during which the patient tested positive for COVID-19, and again required Tablo therapy of greater than 12 h.

The mean prescribed dialysis session length (DSL) per treatment was 24 h. All treatments used a high flux dialyzer and dialysate calcium bath of 2.5 mEq/L. The majority were prescribed a 4 mEq/L potassium bath (83%), a median sodium of 140 mEq/L (135-145) and bicarbonate of 35 mEq/L (30-40). Median prescribed dialysate fluid temperature was 36.0° C (35.0-38.0). A continuous infusion of heparin per site protocol was utilized in 46% of the treatments.
Treatment parameters A total of 1,855 h of prolonged RRT on Tablo were analyzed. The mean dialysate flow rate (DFR) was 101±60 mL/min, with a blood flow rate (BFR) of

176±40 mL/min. Treatment parameters and heparin usage are presented in Table 2. A total of 99% of treatments achieved a delivered RRT dose of>20 mL/kg/hr per treatment, with a mean total ultrafiltration (UF) rate of 3.2±3.1 mL/kg/hr.
The dialysis treatment time was delivered in 91% of treatments, with 6% ending early due to an alarm, and 3% ending due to clotting. Of the five treatments (6%) ending due to an alarm, two were related to arterial pressure alarms that resulted in a user-directed end of treatment and the remaining three involved device-directed alarms that ended treatment to prioritize patient safety. These were due to air in the venous bloodline (1), incorrect dialysate conductivity reading (1), and saline infusion delay (1). See Figs. 1, 2 and 3 for treatment outcomes.
Of the three treatments (3%) that ended due to clotting, one occurred in a non-COVID-19 patient that was on a heparin drip, with the remaining two treatments occurring in COVID-19 patients who were not on a heparin drip.
Clinically significant alarms A total of 985 clinically significant alarms were observed, resulting in a median overall rate of 0.4 alarms per treatment hour. Median rates of clinically significant alarms in the non-COVID-19 and the COVID-19groups were 0.4 (0-3.4) and 0.5 (0-3.0) per treatment hour, respectively.
The median time to alarm resolution by site staff in the ICU was 14 s. Alarms for non-COVID-19 treatments were resolved at a median time of 13 (3-116) seconds, while alarms for COVID-19 treatments were resolved in 21 (3-64) seconds. Alarms were related to venous pressure (59%), arterial pressure (40%), and additional safety alarms (<1%). Median blood pump

stoppage time related to clinically significant alarms was 2.3 min per treatment. Blood pump stoppage time was higher in the COVID-19 subgroup with a median of 11.4 (0.1-22.5) minutes when compared to the nonCOVID-19 with a median of 2.2 (0-20.7) minutes per

treatment. Mean values for alarm data are presented in Table 3.
Cartridge usage The average cartridge usage per treatment was 1.3±0.6 with 79% (69 treatments) requiring the use of a single cartridge (refer to Table 2). Increased cartridge utilization was associated with a higher rate of clinically significant alarms per hour of 1.7±0.9 compared to treatments utilizing one cartridge (0.4±0.4). Of note, the mean cartridge usage in the non-COVID-19 (1.3±0.6) and COVID-19 (1.4±0.7) groups was similar.

COVID19+ECMO patient One COVID-19+patient requiring RRT received concurrent ECMO therapy. Thirteen Tablo treatments were performed during the patient's hospital admission via a temporary dialysis catheter, with an admission weight of 124 kg and SOFA score of 13. The dialysis treatment time was delivered in 77% (10/13) of all treatments, with two treatments ending due to arterial pressure alarms and one treatment ending due to additional safety alarm related to air in venous bloodline.
The alarm rate for the COVID-19+ECMO treatments occurred at a median rate of 2.0 (0.6-8.1), with a median alarm resolution time of 9 (4-14) seconds. The median blood pump stoppage time was 15 (4-46) minutes. The median UF rate was 5.2±1.0 mL/kg/hr. Median cartridge usage for the COVID-19+ECMO treatments was 1.8±1.5, with three treatments requiring greater than three cartridges to deliver the intended therapy.
Discussion The use of the Tablo Hemodialysis System for up to 24 h in this critically ill population resulted in high clinical treatment success, low cartridge utilization, minimal clotting, short average blood pump stoppage times and low rates of clinically significant alarms which were resolved quickly; irrespective of COVID status. These factors all likely contributed to the dialysis treatment time being delivered in 91% of treatments, with 99% of treatments achieving or exceeding target effluent rates of>20 ml/kg/hr [5].
Over the course of 100 treatments, only three treatments were discontinued due to visible clotting. Two of the three occurred in COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with the increased risk of circuit clotting reported in the literature [19]. There remained a single clotting event in a non-COVID-19 patient on a heparin drip.
The rate of clinically significant alarms per 24-h treatment period was low and was accompanied by rapid alarm resolution. The mean blood pump stoppage time observed in this study (4.5±5.2 min per treatment), trended lower than previous reports from a conventional RRT device (6.7±9.5 min) [20]. The increase in blood pump stoppage times in the COVID-19 subgroup can be attributed to the higher number of total alarms per treatment and higher mean time to alarm resolution. The alarm resolution time in this subgroup was likely due to the need for ICU staff to don PPE prior to entry into the treatment room.
As previously mentioned, the COVID-19+ECMO patient was excluded from the broader analysis due to the increased complexity of managing both therapies within a single extracorporeal circuit. Increased alarm

rates were noted during the initial hours of therapy and were due to the adjustment of stopcock positioning to optimize the combined ECMO/Dialysis extracorporeal circuit (data not shown). This increased blood pump stoppage time may have contributed to the high cartridge usage that was observed with this patient. Additionally, while data concerning the incidence of clotting in RRT requiring COVID-19+ECMO patients are scarce, the existing literature supports that these patients are at an elevated risk of experiencing clotting events [11, 21] and may also have contributed to the results observed.
Strengths This is the first study to provide detailed data concerning the expanded capabilities that Tablo can now deliver on a single cartridge for up to 24 h. The study evaluated Tablo's performance in a real-world setting, which is particularly valuable as it demonstrates Tablo can successfully deliver adequate renal replacement therapy to critically ill patients, including those with COVID-19 and undergoing ECMO therapy. As COVID-19 surges are likely to continue well into the future [22], these data further support that Tablo therapy prescribed for greater than 12 h can perform treatments with minimal interruptions and decrease the overall burden on nursing staff associated with cartridge changes, complex alarm troubleshooting, and clotted extracorporeal circuits.
Future directions The minimal clotting events and low cartridge usage that were observed are incredibly encouraging, especially in a vulnerable population at increased risk of clotting due to COVID-19 infection [23, 24]. Although not utilized as part of this study, Tablo has the ability to deliver a scheduled saline flush that can automate the delivery of up to 300 mL of saline every 60 min during treatment. While further evidence is needed, prior reports on the use of saline flushes in outpatient intermittent hemodialysis suggests the benefit of reduced clotting during treatment [25, 26]. Additional studies in acute care settings are required to evaluate the effectiveness this feature may have on clotting outcomes and help fill evidence gaps related to anticoagulation strategies in patients requiring prolonged therapies [27].
While this study was not set up to determine any specific cost benefits associated with the use of Tablo in the ICU, future trials comparing Tablo's cartridge lifespan to that of filters used in conventional RRT devices are warranted, as higher filter replacement represents a substantial financial burden to hospital systems [15]. This review did not examine circuit lifespan as it relates to COVID-19

patients requiring prolonged therapies. A recent study on this population reported a median filter life of only 6.5 h [14], further highlighting the positive results presented here.
Limitations While the XTEND trial is the first report of Tablo utilization for greater than 12 h in critically ill patients with key insights into the effectiveness in the acute care setting, there are several limitations to the study. This observational study was not sufficiently powered and involved a small sample size without a control group. Additionally, the treatment success outcomes were subjective and based on assessments made by the clinical expertise of hospital staff. A randomized clinical trial examining multiple, well defined endpoints is needed to appropriately determine the efficacy of Tablo compared to conventional RRT devices. While patient SOFA scores were recorded and assisted in determining acuity, principal diagnosis or primary reason for hospital admission were not included and therefore limit the broader application of these results to a specific AKI population requiring RRT (e.g., sepsis, post-surgical, trauma patients). This also applies to patients admitted to the ICU primarily for COVID-19 complications, as it is possible patients included in this study may have been positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon admission, but not actively experiencing acute COVID viral illness. Furthermore, since the study was conducted at a single center, we are unable to generalize these results. While evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have been published regarding the prescription and delivery of RRT, there is wide variation in treatment implementation amongst institutions [28], which necessitates a larger, multi-center trial to adequately expand upon the findings reported here.
Given the above limitations, the results of the XTEND trial support that Tablo is effective in the treatment of critically ill patients in the ICU who require prolonged therapies, including COVID-19 positive patients. The results presented suggest that Tablo's low alarm rates, rapid alarm resolution, minimal blood pump stoppage time and low cartridge usage per 24 h can reduce the overall cost and nursing staff burden traditionally associated with the provision of extended dialytic therapy in the ICU.

Abstract
Background: Several individual studies from specific countries have reported rising numbers of pediatric COVID19 cases with inconsistent reports on the clinical symptoms including respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms as well as diverse reports on the mean age and household exposure in children. The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in children are not fully understood, hence, comprehensive meta-analyses are needed to provide a better understanding of these characteristics.
Methods: This review was conducted in Medline, Scopus, Cochrane library, Embase, Web of Science, and published reports on COVID-19 in children. Data were extracted by two independent researchers and a third researcher resolved disputes. STATA software and the random-effect model were used in the synthesis of our data. For each model, the heterogeneity between studies was estimated using the Q Cochrane test. Heterogeneity and publication bias were calculated using the ­I2 statistic and Egger's/Begg's tests.
Results: The qualitative systematic review was performed on 32 articles. Furthermore, the meta-analysis estimated an overall rate of involvement at 12% (95% CI: 9-15%) among children, with an ­I2 of 98.36%. The proportion of household exposure was calculated to be 50.99% (95% CI: 20.80%-80.80%) and the proportion of admitted cases was calculated to be 45% (95% CI: 24%-67%). Additionally, the prevalence of cough, fatigue, fever and dyspnea was calculated to be 25% (95% CI: 0.16-0.36), 9% (95% CI: 0.03-0.18), 33% (95% CI: 0.21-0.47) and 9% (95% CI: 0.04-0.15), respectively. It is estimated that 4% (95% CI: 1-8%) of cases required intensive care unit admission.
Conclusions: The pediatric clinical picture of COVID-19 is not simply a classic respiratory infection, but unusual presentations have been reported. Given the high incidence of household transmission and atypical clinical presentation in children, we strongly recommend their inclusion in research and population-based preventive measures like vaccination as well as clinical trials to ensure efficacy, safety, and tolerability in this age group.

of organs across the body [1, 2]. An increasing body of research implies that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may significantly contribute to its spread (COVID-19) [3]. SARS-CoV-2 can infect people of all ages and could have long-term consequences for human health. It has a long incubation time, high infectivity, atypical clinical signs, and a significant fatality rate in elderly adults [4, 5]. Although the epidemiology of COVID-19 in adults has been extensively studied, our understanding of the prevalence and consequences of COVID19 in children remains limited. The majority of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 show minimal infection according to an extensive analysis of pediatric cases [6, 7]. Pediatric patients have been suggested as asymptomatic reservoirs of COVID-19 with their burden barely understood due to the mild and asymptomatic nature of the disease [2, 3, 8]. Despite these, few investigations have concentrated on the epidemiological and clinical aspects of pediatric COVID-19 [5].
With current immunization methods focusing mainly on adults, the pediatric population remains vulnerable to COVID-19 infection [9]. Though the unrelenting efforts of scientists have provided the first oral antiviral (Molnupiravir), which has been approved and shows a significant reduction in hospitalization or mortality in mild COVID-19 cases with good safety and tolerability profile in adults, there is little to insufficient data on pediatric cases [10, 11]. Hence, it is critical to be prepared for new waves in terms of pediatric protection and infection control. This could be enhanced by a comprehensive examination of existing pieces of evidence showing illness transmission trends, as well as distinctive and consistent epidemiological aspects of the infection [4, 9, 12].
Previous studies have reported some unique characteristics in pediatric COVID-19 cases such as lower mortality rate, longer incubation period, and longer respiratory and fecal shedding with high RNA load (83%) [13]. Furthermore, potential comorbidities and coinfections particularly in children, have a critical presentation, with infants younger than 6 months having a substantially higher risk of critical illness [2, 14]. Numerous published articles describe children being infected as part of family clusters [13, 15-21], but limited data exists to appraise the cumulative percentage of household exposures before the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children [4]. Exploring these records in any meta-analysis on COVID-19 is of paramount importance.
Hence, this study will attempt to delineate the rate of pediatric involvement in COVID-19, demographic features of the affected children, the proportion of severe cases, and the rate of household exposure as well as future recommendations on pediatric COVID-19 cases

based on current epidemiological evidence. It will further address the aspect of clinical presentation, whether affected children present with symptoms of classic viral pneumonia or rather present with gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations.
Methods
Overview This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist [22]. The completed PRISMA checklist for the current review is available in the supplementary file.
Search strategy and selection process We conducted an extensive search in Medline (indexed by PubMed), Embase, Scopus, Cochrane library, and Web of Science databases on published studies from January ­20th, 2020 until April ­30th, 2021. Two independent researchers (F.V. and P.S.) performed a primary search simultaneously, and in cases of difference in opinion, they referred back to the selection protocol. If the dispute remained, a third individual (MSY) made the final decision. Keywords included (Pediatric OR children OR child) AND (COVID-19 OR SARS-COV-2). A revisit to the database was conducted by the first author at 9 AM on May ­10th, 2021. Furthermore, our data were scrutinized by checking the Worldometer reports [23] and their sources. This investigation included only articles written in English. The process of study selection is fully reported with a PRISMA flow diagram in Fig. 1 of the final report.
Eligibility criteria This study includes peer-reviewed published studies from January ­20th, 2020 until April ­30th, 2021, including registries [15-17, 24-28], cross-sectional observational studies and case series [13, 18, 29-34], and case reports [19-21, 35-43], which reported children (0-19 years old) affected by SARS-COV-2. Specifically, we included the original and peer-reviewed English papers fulfilling the eligibility criteria in the final report. The following records were excluded in the present study;
· Review articles, editorials, commentaries, opinions, or any studies with no original data. · Ongoing projects (e.g., articles discussing the protocol of a future study, papers in preprint servers, etc.) · Non-human (e.g., animal and laboratory) studies. · Duplicated results in databases.

tests. Studies with a NOS score of 5 or less were excluded from the meta-analysis.

Critical appraisal Cross-sectional observational studies that met the aforementioned criteria underwent bias assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 1) [44]. The highest score (which is 16) shows the highest quality of a study considering clear goals, representativeness of the sample, sufficient and justified sample size, having defined the status of the non-respondents, ascertainment of the exposure, high comparability, and independent assessment of outcome with the use of appropriate statistical

Outcomes The main outcomes of interest included a proportion of children among the total infected population, mean age and sex ratio among infected children, and percentages of different clinical symptoms. In addition, the proportion of children with household exposure before diagnosis and the proportion of admitted/severe cases were extracted. Severe cases were defined as those who were admitted into the hospital/intensive care unit with at least SpO2<94%, those who had multiple organ failure, septic shock, and respiratory failure.

Statistical analysis Meta-analysis was conducted utilizing metaprop and metan commands in STATA software version 15.0 StataCorp, College Station, TX. Forest plots were used to show the point and interval estimation of studies and the overall estimation of all studies. For numeric variables, the mean and standard error were used for the metaanalysis. Median or Mid-range was used instead of mean if it was not available. In most of the studies, standard deviation (SD) was reported and standard error was estimated by SD n formula. For those studies that reported
range or interquartile range, SD was estimated by dividing the range by 2 and the interquartile range by 1.35, and thereafter, the standard error was estimated from SD.
Publication bias was evaluated for meta-analyses on 10 papers or more, by using Egger's, Begg's tests. P-values of 0.05 or less were considered significant. Furthermore, publication bias funnel plots for analysis of the proportion of pediatric cases and mean age were drawn (Fig. 2).
Heterogeneity was assessed statistically using the standard Chi-square test. The random-effect model was used and for each model, the heterogeneity between studies was estimated using the Q Cochrane test. Also, the intensity of heterogeneity was calculated using the I­2 statistic.

Results
Study selection A total of 671 studies were identified after the primary search, of which 224 were removed due to duplication and other reasons. Titles and abstracts of 447 papers were then checked for their eligibility for this study and 134 articles were excluded (Non-English Text (1), Review articles about the infection (62), Erratum: (2), Irrelevant to our study (68), and no full text (1)). Full texts of 308 published articles and 5 available national registry data on pediatric COVID-19 were studied, which resulted in the exclusion of 281 more articles (Fig. 1). The qualitative systematic review was performed on 32 articles. We did not import low-quality articles, fortunately, we did not have any. Analytically, 27 articles were of good quality 79.4% and the other 7 articles were Fair 20.6%.
Study characteristics Egger's, Begg's tests both showed no significant publication bias for the estimated proportion of pediatric cases (p=0.105 and 0.449, respectively). Publication bias funnel plots for analysis of the proportion of pediatric cases and mean age are shown in Figs. 2a and b. Heterogeneity assessed by ­I2 values for the proportion of pediatric cases (childhood corona and 0-9 years old), the proportion of male cases, and mean age is depicted in each of the corresponding forest plots (Figs. 3a, b, c and d).

Prevalence of children's cases involvement and estimated mean age The proportion of pediatric cases has been reported in 18 publications (Fig. 5a). The meta-analysis estimated an overall rate of involvement at 12% (95% CI: 9-15%) among children, with an ­I2 of 98.36%. Moreover, the meta-analysis estimated an overall proportion of male cases and mean age of 38% (95% CI: 24-53%) and 9.83 years (95% CI: 8.67-10.98), respectively (Figs. 3c and b).
Household exposure and disease severity The proportion of household exposure was calculated to be 50.99% (95% CI: 20.80%-80.80%) among the five studies that reported household exposure (Fig. 5b). The proportion of admitted cases was calculated to be 45% (95% CI: 24%-67%) among the 18 studies that reported the proportion of admitted cases (Figs. 4a and 4b). Heterogeneity ­(I2) statistic was 99.66% and 99.75%, respectively.

Characteristics The prevalence of comorbidity was estimated to be 31% (95% CI: 0.16-0.48) according to the meta-analysis. The prevalence of cough, fatigue, fever and dyspnea was calculated to be 25% (95% CI: 0.16-0.36), 9% (95% CI: 0.03-0.18), 33% (95% CI: 0.21-0.47) and 9% (95% CI: 0.04-0.15), respectively (Figs. 6a, b, c, d and e). Furthermore, the meta-analysis estimated the prevalence of diarrhea, headache, rhinorrhea, sore throat and vomiting to be 6% (95% CI: 0.03-0.10), 9% (95% CI: 0.05- 0.15), 13% (95% CI: 0.06-0.22), 7% (95% CI: 0.14-0.22) and 7% (95% CI: 0.02-0.14), respectively (Figs. 7a, b, c and d). Lastly, it is estimated that 4% (95% CI: 1-8%) of cases required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission according to the studies analyzed (Fig. 4a).
Comment Principal findings Considering the proportion of children in the general population [24, 27], this in-depth review shows a low rate of SARS-COV-2 infection in children. The novel coronavirus affects both sexes similarly. There is an

estimated high rate of household exposure and cross infection among family members, however, children have less chance of getting a severe form of the disease.
Strengths of the study In this extensive review of the literature, pooled data of 743,763 infected patients were extracted by a systematic approach to collate the individual estimates reported from 4 continents all around the globe which gives a clear picture of the pandemic in the pediatric population. Potent statistical methods for meta-analysis with STATA software support our results.

Discussion This study aimed at describing the COVID-19 epidemiological characteristics in pediatric patients. The knowledge of COVID-19 in pediatric patients has improved exponentially since the inception of the disease in 2019 and so was cases. In the current investigation, we included a total of 671 studies from the primary search and effectively conducted a qualitative systematic review on 32 articles of which 27 (79.4%) articles were of good quality, with no significant publication bias. We found that the overall prevalence rate of COVID-19 among pediatric patients was 12% (95% CI: 9-15%). The frequency of pediatric COVID-19 increased to 19.0% as of

7 April 2022 in the US [45]. Moreover, this study found a higher prevalence of COVID-19 among female pediatric patients than males (38% (95% CI: 24-53%)), contrary to other studies which reported male dominance, such as Al Mansoori et al. (50.3%) [46], Dong Y et al. (56.6%) [47], and Armin S et al.(59.4%) [48]. The mean age of our population was 9.83 years while other studies reported a mean of 5.3 years [48]. Such variations may emanate from differences in study population and location. However, our population had a median age of 7 years, with a range from birth to 16 years, which was similar to previous studies [46, 47], indicating that children of all ages may be susceptible to COVID-19.
Our study found 50.99% of household exposure among the eight studies that reported household exposure. A previous investigation by Cheng-Xian et al. found that family clustering was a major (66%) transmission route

for pediatric COVID-19 [49]. This study showed a high rate of household exposure before diagnosis in children later infected with COVID-19 (Fig. 5b) and bears an epidemiological significance indicating homes as the primary source of COVID-19 transmission in this period. However, Zhang C et al. (2020) found no direct evidence in their study regarding the transmission from children to adults [50]. Regardless, the risk of family cluster transmission from asymptomatic children should not be downplayed but be considered in policymaking for epidemic control. Moreover, preventive measures should be observed especially by family clusters of infections. High-risk children such as the family members of the confirmed cases, should take protective measures, may be recommended to take mineral supplements, high protein diets, fruits, and also pay attention to child psychological protection and intervention, as well as the living

environment, etc. In addition, this study showed that children are more likely to present with diarrhea than adults, on top of respiratory symptoms and fever. Considering the high household rate of COVID-19 exposure for children, physicians are encouraged to investigate more into the family history and contacts of the child presenting with symptoms. It also signifies the importance of social-distancing the infected household members from children as a preventive measure.
As in all previous investigations, fever and cough were the main symptoms that could be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and other symptoms like sore throat, dizziness, headache, and myalgia. The prevalence of cough, fatigue, fever, and dyspnea were 25%, 9%, 33%, and 9% respectively. Our study found the prevalence of cough (25%) between other studies which recorded 32.4% [49], (62%) [50], (67%) [51] and 19% [52]. Previously, Haiyan Q et al. reported a fever prevalence of 36% among pediatric patients [52], while other studies found 77.9% [49], (76%) [50], and (78%) [51] but the current study (33%) was below the average. Other prevalence parameters found through meta-analysis were diarrhea, headache, rhinorrhea, sore throat and vomiting to be 6% (95% CI: 0.03- 0.10), 9% (95% CI: 0.05-0.15), 13% (95% CI: 0.06-0.22), 7% (95% CI: 0.14-0.22) and 7% (95% CI: 0.02-0.14),

respectively. Gastrointestinal symptoms were mainly diarrhea (6%) and vomiting (7%) which were lower than previous studies vomiting (12%) [50] and diarrhea (12%) [50]. Headache was only prevalent in 9% of our study, however, some studies such as (57%) [51], report this symptom as major for pediatric COVID-19. Lastly, it is estimated that 4% (95% CI: 1-8%) of cases required ICU admission according to some studies.
Since many children do not show the classic picture of viral pneumonia, physicians must have a high level of suspicion not to miss COVID-19 in a child. Moreover, there have been some reports of unusual clinical presentations such as skin rash [16] and neurologic symptoms (upward gaze and spastic limbs) [20]. Given the different respiratory and GI presentations, and inconsistent reports of unusual presentations, a global registry is required, similar to what was done for pediatric cancers, and since the low rate of infection in children and lack of registry are serious limitations on the way of understanding disease characteristics in children.
Considering the high household rate of COVID-19 exposure for children, physicians are encouraged to investigate more into the family history and contacts of the child presenting with symptoms. It also signifies the importance of social distancing the infected household members from children. We were unable to perform a

meta-analysis on the duration of incubation period or shedding of the virus in children but there are reports [1, 53] that both are longer in children about 6.5 days. Indeed, an undiagnosed child with COVID-19, in addition to being at risk of getting the severe form of the disease, could act as a significant source of infection transmission to others. Thus, we recommend policymakers emphasize standard infection control precautions and safety measures during this pandemic, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, room ventilation, avoiding crowds, handwashing, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue among children during home and schooling.
COVID-19 cases in children showing a systemic inflammatory syndrome have been reported in at least 8 states in the US (including California, Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania as well as Washington, D.C.) [54]. Currently, it is not known why children usually show mild to moderate forms of infection and only rarely present with cytokine storm syndrome [55]. Various hypotheses exist like fewer travels, less exposure to people (especially at the beginning of the pandemic), clearer respiratory tracts with better pathogen clearance compared to adults, fewer comorbidities, and strong innate and weaker adaptive immune defenses [56].
Fever is a prominent sign of both Kawasaki Disease (KD) and COVID-19 infection. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first differential diagnosis to have in mind in a child with fever is probably COVID-19 infection or its combination. There are a few reports on this subject [57, 58]. KD is a rare disease with an estimated prevalence of 0.10% among children younger than 5 years old [59]. Its diagnosis is very important and missing it could result in complications like Coronary Artery Aneurysms (CAA). The recommendation is to be always suspicious of KD in a febrile child, especially if younger than a year old. If KD is diagnosed, intravenous immunoglobulin treatment should be immediately started, preferably in the first 7 days from the onset of fever [57, 58]. In the published literature only one case of COVID-19 infection in an infant with classic KD signs has been reported, who was discharged with Low-dose Aspirin pending further cardiologic evaluation [57]. Most recently, there have been some worrying reports of a presumed severe COVID-Kawasaki syndrome in the affected children from the US, UK, France, Italy, and Spain [60, 61]. It is believed to be related to poorer outcomes. There have been reports of 33 COVID-Kawasaki syndromes only in New York. Considering the low number of patients under 5 years old affected by COVID-19, the risk of Kawasaki disease likely is enormous. Kawasaki Disease was one of the first diseases where a strong Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) association was found [62]. Hence, this

suggests certain HLA-types in children may be more susceptible to severe forms of SARS-COV-2 infection and could be an important clue to the etiology of poor prognosis of COVID-19 in this age group.
Limitations of the data We did not have access to certain published papers. Due to insufficient data, we were not able to perform a metaanalysis on some aspects of the disease such as the percentage of children with comorbidities, duration of the incubation period, and some symptoms like abdominal pain. Our investigation did not include laboratory and radiographic findings and we recommend future research into these. Future studies need to be performed on the COVID-Kawasaki syndrome to determine risk factors for poor outcomes in children. There is a possibility of publication bias in some reports, especially for mean age, and we recommend the creation of a global registry on pediatric COVID-19.
Future recommendations and vaccination priority in children This investigation described the characteristics of epidemiological characteristics of COVID19 in pediatric patients. Furthermore, the analyzed data from minors under the age of 19 shows that they are less prone to developing severe COVID-19 disease but are equally at risk of contracting the infection. Similar to previous investigations, the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is somewhat different from the adult population. For example, children have longer incubation and shedding periods than adults, an epidemiological phenomenon that places pediatric age groups as potential hosts of the infection and capable of infecting many people. This evidence shows that children might be spreaders of COVID-19 more than we ever thought, and for the pandemic to stop, all children should be involved in mass preventive measures like vaccination programs, social distancing, and masking. In addition, it is encouraged to involve children in various clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines and drugs to generate sufficient safety and efficacy profiles for this age group.
Conclusion Children are not safe from COVID-19 infection. About 37% of those diagnosed will need admission or end up with a severe form of the disease. The pediatric clinical picture of COVID-19 is not simply a classic respiratory infection but unusual presentations have been reported. Mortality among children with COVID-19 is rare. Given the high incidence, we propose a global registry on pediatric COVID-19 cases be developed to

Vosoughi et al. BMC Pediatrics (2022) 22:613

help identify disease characteristics, similar to what was done previously for pediatric cancer. Considering the potential of children to act as reservoirs and spread the coronavirus, we strongly recommend the inclusion of children in population-based preventive measures like vaccination as well as clinical trials to ensure efficacy, safety, and tolerability in this age group.

RESEARCH
Exit strategies from lockdowns due to COVID-19: a scoping review
Madhavi Misra1*, Harsha Joshi1, Rakesh Sarwal2 and Krishna D. Rao3

Open Access

Abstract
Introduction: In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, countries have adopted various degrees of restrictive measures on people to reduce COVID-19 transmission. These measures have had significant social and economic costs. In the absence of therapeutics, and low vaccination coverage, strategies for a safe exit plan from a lockdown are required to mitigate the transmission and simultaneously re-open societies. Most countries have outlined or have implemented lockdown exit plans. The objective of this scoping review is to (a) identify and map the different strategies for exit from lockdowns, (b) document the effects of these exit strategies, and (c) discuss features of successful exit strategies based on the evidence.
Methods: A five-step approach was used in this scoping review: (a) identifying the research question and inclusion/ exclusion criteria; (b) searching the literature using keywords within PubMed and WHO databases; (c) study selection; (d) data extraction; (e) collating results and qualitative synthesis of findings.
Results: Of the 406 unique studies found, 107 were kept for full-text review. Studies suggest the post-peak period as optimal timing for an exit, supplemented by other triggers such as sufficient health system capacity, and increased testing rate. A controlled and step-wise exit plan which is flexible and guided by information from surveillance systems is optimal. Studies recommend continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing, use of facemasks, and hygiene measures, in different combinations when exiting from a lockdown, even after optimal vaccination coverage has been attained.
Conclusion: Reviewed studies have suggested adopting a multi-pronged strategy consisting of different approaches depending on the context. Among the different exit strategies reviewed (phase-wise exit, hard exit, and constant cyclic patterns of lockdown), phase-wise exit appears to be the optimal exit strategy.

Background The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for infecting 362 million people. Around 5.6 million people have lost their lives [1]. To mitigate the effects of this pandemic, most countries have implemented

various degrees of population movement restrictions. This has involved closing borders, closing non-essential workplaces and schools, restrictions on gatherings and movements of people (road, air, sea). Some of the mitigation strategies ranged from complete lockdown as seen in India [2] to moderate strategies like in the United Kingdom supported by increased testing, tracing, and quarantining [3]. Other mitigation measures included age-selective distancing. For instance, in New Zealand and South Africa, the older population and those with co-morbidities were recommended to be isolated at

home, while the younger population were allowed to go to work [4].
These restrictive measures have significant social and economic consequences, especially in low income, and low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). These measures adversely affected the disadvantaged population as it led to the shutdown of economic activities, loss of employment, disruption in education, challenges in access to essential health services and other public services, including food insecurity [5]. There is, therefore, a need to exit from lockdowns while simultaneously mitigating the COVID-19 transmission. In the absence of therapeutics and a significant vaccination coverage, a situation that is commonly seen in many LMICs, there is a need for strategies for a safe exit from the restriction measures.
To circumvent the challenges faced following the lockdowns, countries have attempted to devise optimal strategies to exit from lockdowns. Many countries have defined graded exit plans with each phase informed by triggers such as case numbers, infection rate, health system capacity, etc. Other countries have relied on seroprevalence studies and increased testing prior to opening up. The phase-wise exit plans are usually structured by type of business, school, and size of gatherings, etc. The timing and containment measures during exit also varied. Almost all exit strategies studied suggest the continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs- These include physical distancing, use of face mask, and hygiene measures, and other restrictive measures such as stay at home, school closures, travel restrictions, border closures, and steps to address ventilation measures especially in closed spaces) in various combinations suited to country contexts. Countries such as New Zealand and South Korea began relaxing restrictions only after the number of new daily cases reached almost zero. Austria began implementing its exit plan when the daily caseload fell below 100, so the health system wasn't overwhelmed [4]. However, many countries have opted to open up when transmission rates were falling, but had significant

daily case numbers. Therefore, measures for containing the spread of disease need to be in place while opening, to avoid the health system from being overwhelmed by another wave.
The objective of this scoping review is to systematically document the evidence regarding exit strategies related to COVID-19 lockdowns. This scoping review has the following specific aims: (a) to identify and map the different strategies that have been adopted by countries, and are suggested from modelled scenarios of exit from COVID-19 related lockdowns, (b) document the effects of these exit strategies, and (c) discuss features of successful exit strategies based on the available evidence.
Countries are at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. While increasing vaccination coverage is a global goal, many countries have not been able to achieve this due to constraints related to vaccine availability and affordability. With new variants emerging such as Omicron in November 2021, some countries responded with a knee-jerk reaction of imposing travel bans and strict lockdowns [6, 7]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has criticized travel bans, as they affect lives and livelihoods more than the spread of virus [8]. Planning how best to exit from lockdowns is an important policy and public health decision. Depending on the local health system capacity, ongoing calibration of restriction measures is required. There is limited evidence so far on the effects of different exit strategies and findings from this scoping review can guide countries in identifying optimal exit strategies.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria This scoping review was based on searches conducted on the PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and WHO (https://www.who.int) databases in the interest of time (Electronic search strategy for PubMed database provided as Additional file 1). The inclusion criteria for the search included studies from all countries and the time frame was the start of the pandemic in

2020 till May 2021 (refer to Table 1 on PICOS framework). The most recent electronic database search was conducted on 7th June 2021. Full-length, peerreviewed and pre-print literature available in the English language related to exiting from a lockdown/ opening from a lockdown/ removal of lockdowns was included. All clinical studies including drug trials, hospital-based studies, and vaccine efficacy studies were excluded.
Data synthesis After removing the duplicates, two reviewers (MM and HJ) independently examined the abstracts and selected 197 articles for full-text review. Ninety articles were removed as they did not match inclusion criteria as per PICOS and 107 articles were retained for the review. The exclusions after full-text review were discussed among the two reviewers. Data from the included articles were extracted in an excel sheet under pre-populated themes on the timing of exit, determinants for exit, process of exit, components of exit strategy, and

effects of opening up. Qualitative synthesis of findings was undertaken and reviewed by all four authors (MM, HJ, RS and KR).
Results
Search outcomes The search yielded 555 articles using keywords such as Covid, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), exiting from lockdown, and exit strategies. We found 406 unique studies combining both databases and after reviewing the abstracts and full-text review, retained 107 studies as a part of this review (refer to Fig. 1 on study selection flow chart).
Description of the included studies Of the 107 studies, 98 (91.5%) were original research studies, seven (6.5%) were reviews and two (2%) were policy papers. Of the 98 original research studies, 82 studies (84%) were based on mathematical modelling, and 16 (16%) were observational studies (refer to Fig. 2 on types of studies found).

Fig.2 Types of studies included in the review

The majority of the studies (68%) were from highincome countries (as per the World Bank classification of countries by income, accessed from https://datahelpdesk. worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world- bank-country-and-lending-groups), about 18% of studies were based in middle-income countries and only two studies were based in low-income countries. The review found eleven studies (11%) that had used global databases.
Types of exit strategies and their effects Based on the review, we have identified the following key themes to describe an exit strategy (refer to Table 2).
1. Timing of exit- Here the focus is on pre-requisites for opening up after lockdown and determinants for deciding the timing of exit.
2. Process of exit- This section covers strategies adopted to exit from lockdown and the effect they have had on COVID-19 outcomes.
3. Supporting conditions for exit strategies- This section reports on the types of public health measures for containment, and use of NPIs during exit from lockdown.

1. Timing of the exit
Post peak period reducing number of cases and better health system capacity Two review articles based on global data [9, 10] observe that most countries have opted for opening during the `post-peak period'. In this period, a plateauing of cases and hospital admissions are maintained for 2 weeks, implying that the health system can cater to the cases without a crisis. However, this approach risks the formation of new clusters, triggering the next wave of the pandemic, as most of the population is likely not exposed yet to the virus. A strong surveillance system to classify the epidemiological situation is required during the post-peak period. Petersen et al. [10] have adopted the WHO guideline to classify new cases in the postpeak period as imported (from other countries), part of a known cluster, or those with an unknown source.
An article [9] has highlighted that governments need to take into account individual healthcare, economic and social considerations while deciding on the timing of opening, emphasizing that context is important. A policy paper

[4] has summarized various triggers to determine the timing for exiting from lockdowns such as (a) health system capacity (number of beds, equipment available), (b) health system demand (e.g. ICU admissions), (c) death rate (e.g. New York's plan to ease restrictions after 14days continuous fall in death rate), (d) mode of transmission (New Zealand's plan explicitly relates easing levels with change in the mode of transmission- to households only), and (e) costbenefit analysis. Cuschieri [11] has described Malta's experience of reopening from the COVID-19 lockdown where the government considered gradual relaxation of lockdown when the `Reproduction number' (R- The effective reproductive number is the average number of secondary cases per infectious case in a population made up of both susceptible and non-susceptible hosts. If R>1, the number of cases will increase, such as at the start of an epidemic, and where R<1 there will be a decline in the number of cases [12])' went below one. Raje et al. [13] have found crossover time point (when the case recovery rate is greater than case active rate) as an effective trigger to initiate relaxation of restrictions, based on country experiences. Importance

of an evidence-based approach for the timing of exit, which takes into account prevalence and spread of the disease has been advocated in several studies [14, 15].
Findings from modelling studies are corroborated by empirical studies (refer to Table 3). These studies demonstrate the postponing of restrictions, farther beyond the peak may have additional benefits in reducing the number of cases. A US based [16] and an India-based [17] modelling study shows benefits of prolonged removal of restrictions possibly due to progressive exhaustion of the infectious pool in the population.
Findings from an Italy-based modelling study [18] suggest that the stricter the period of lockdown, the longer it might take to exit from the lockdown. In this scenario of a strict lockdown, the subsequent wave is anticipated to be stronger as well. Similarly, if the lockdown is lifted before reaching the peak of the COVID-19 cases, the next wave of cases will have a sharper peak. Studies based

· Early relaxation of NPIs before sufficient immunity has been achieved can lead to a larger wave of infection · If all restrictions are removed only after the entire adult population has been offered two doses (assuming vaccine provides 85% protection against infection), there will still be a next infection wave. (Except, when vaccine uptake is 95, 90, and 85% in those aged 80years and older, 50-79years, and 18-49years, respectively)

in different contexts [18-20] have modelled scenarios of premature exit and demonstrated the risk of sharper and rapid infection peaks.
Another modelling study from Italy [21] hypothesized that the true number of infected cases and relative testing capacity are better determinants to guide lockdown exit strategies. It concludes that decisions on opening should be taken at the local/regional level based on capacity to identify new cases and social contacts. Based on a modelling exercise on data from different regions of Italy, local testing capacity was suggested to be more than 16 times the estimated true number of newly infected cases if a decision to re-open is to be taken. Sufficient health system capacity to cater to stable daily cases was emphasized as a determining factor for opening up [23].
Vaccination coverage/immunity Vaccines to protect from COVID-19 are now an important part of the exit strategy. Moore et al. [22] estimate the effects of vaccination coverage and lifting of restrictions in the UKbased modelling study. The study finds future waves of infection and deaths can be reduced by increasing levels of vaccine-derived immunity in the population. Early relaxation of NPIs before sufficient immunity has been achieved can lead to a larger wave of infection. Furthermore, the study adds vaccination alone cannot bring R below one, and control the epidemic. As per the modelling exercises, with assumptions of vaccine offering 85% protection against the infection and vaccine uptake above 75%, R would reduce to 1.58, which is still greater than the required value of below one. Therefore, NPIs such as face masks, physical distancing, and hygiene measures are required, even after the adult population is fully vaccinated and a stricter lockdown has been lifted.
2. Process of exit Thirty-six studies in the review examined different processes of exit- a) phase-wise/progressive/gradual, b) hard exit (resuming all activities at one time), c) cyclic exit (short cycles of opening and closing) and, d) zonal lockdowns (containment in clusters). The majority of studies have identified phase-wise exit as the most appropriate strategy (refer to Table 4).
Six studies [24-29] included comparisons of different exit strategies. Out of these, four studies [24, 26, 28, 29] compared hard exit with gradual exit and concluded gradual exit to be effective. One study [25] compared zonal strategy with cyclic strategy and concluded zonal

strategy to be effective in LMIC settings. The sixth study [27] was inconclusive about the findings.
Findings related to the process of exit from the select studies have been listed in Table 5.
Phasewise Studies done in Belgium [30, 31, 38], Germany [32], US [33], Netherlands [39], Spain [40], and India [34, 35] show evidence for a phase-wise opening. A study from Germany [41] suggests phase-wise opening should be reversible (i.e., if the reproduction number- R starts going up, the lockdowns can be easily re-imposed) and be pilot tested for four-eight weeks before complete opening up of all restrictions.
Cyclic/rolling lockdown
· To get to an optimal exit strategy, a study from Germany [37] suggests repetitive or rolling lockdowns for up to two-three years by which time herd immunity is reached as this would keep the R under one. This study suggests policymakers must weigh the extent of restrictions against the economic consequences. The conflict between health protection and economic interests needs reconciliation while opening from the lockdown.
· Another modelling study from France [36] proposes a cyclic or a zig-zag schedule of four-day work and 10-day lockdown which can prevent a resurgence and also provide part-time employment. This strategy suggests a drastic, cautionary, or a relaxed approach to lockdowns that must be supported by strict implementation of NPIs (hand hygiene, face mask use, physical distancing, and testing, contact tracing, and quarantine).
· These studies suggest considering economic and social costs before implementing a cyclic or rolling lockdown which has logistic challenges. They caution that periodic lockdown and openings do not lead to herd immunity. Transitioning from one phase to the next is made after measuring the impact of deconfinement by estimating the daily R.

Determinants Based on the daily number of new hospitalizations and admissions to the ICU.
Regular re-assessment is crucial to adjust to evolving behavioural changes that can affect epidemic diffusion. In addition to social distancing, sufficient capacity for extensive testing and contact tracing is essential for successful mitigation. Long duration of remaining restrictions would increase relative economic costs compared to alternative gradual opening strategies Sustained public social distancing and mask wearing, targeting transmission reduction rather than removing susceptible altogether, to reduce R.

(Policy paper- overview)

Zigzag strategy of alternating between periodic and moderate deconfinement. The period should remain small compared to the time needed to reach the peak of the epidemic if deconfinement is maintained (which is in the order of 4 to 5months). A periodic deconfinement is equivalent to a weekly organized deconfinement with 3 and a half days of strict lockdown per week. Scenarios alternating strict lockdown and moderate deconfinement can allow the epidemic to be brought under control without resorting to group immunity.
Repetitive short-term contact reductions. Such reductions can be triggered adaptively if death rates, need for ICU, etc. exceed a threshold. With additional hygienic measures, the situation can be enhanced further. However, repetitive shortterm lockdowns and hygiene measures need to be in place for the next two or three years until herd immunity can be obtained (if vaccination is not available before).
Zonal or local lockdowns may be suitable for some countries where systematic identification of new outbreak clusters in real-time would be feasible

The effects of antibody tests would add significant benefit to exclude people with antibodies from the contact reductions.
Requires generalised testing and surveillance structure, and a well-thought-out (and executed) zone management plan.

Moderate deconfinement with strong but non-drastic interventions, whether gradual or sudden, can lead to a rapid resumption of the epidemic, with a saturation of intensive care units in the fall and a peak of the epidemic in winter.

Zonal lockdown [25]
· Zonal lockdowns are local lockdowns where specific `hotspots' have a sudden outbreak cluster (high number of cases) which have been identified in real-time. Such clustered social distancing works by dividing the population into "zones" according to the geospatial distribution. The disease clusters are contained within these zones so that interactions within a zone are significantly greater than interactions between them. An India-based study [42] suggests that containment zones with a higher case-load should remain even during the exit phase.
· Although effective in developed countries, a study based in LMICs [25] suggests zonal lockdowns with the relaxation of restrictions in remaining places has challenges in LMIC, due to the absence of large-scale population surveillance system and limited testing facilities.
A modelling study [28] compared the effectiveness of different types of exit strategies- hard exit, progressive exit, and cyclic exit (2 weeks of lockdown and 2 weeks of opening over four cycles) and maintaining status quo. Evolution of the Rt (effective reproduction number at a particular time is the expected number of new infections caused by an infectious individual in a population where some individuals may no longer be susceptible [12]) values for the four exit strategies modelled for Luxembourg, Italy, and Japan found that progressive exit offered better outcomes in terms of little impact on the economy and reduced number of cases. A Singapore-based study [43] concludes the effectiveness of gradual relaxation in flattening the curve compared to a sudden resumption of social interactions.
3. Supporting conditions for exit strategies Steps supporting the exit strategy and facilitating its successful implementation include public health (these include testing, contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, and surveillance), pharmaceutical (such as treatment, drug therapies, and vaccination), and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs- these include physical distancing, use of face masks, and hygiene measures). Other restrictive NPIs such as stay at home, school closures, travel restrictions, border closures, and steps to address ventilation measures especially in closed spaces are implemented in varying degrees depending upon the number of cases). This review is focused on public health and NPIs as measures of exiting from a lockdown.

Health system and public health capacity Along with ensuring physical distancing and reducing contacts to control the transmission, the purpose, and justification for lockdowns have been to strengthen the capacity of health systems. This would include not only the facility level capacity, but also the public health capacity in terms of testing, tracing, quarantine and isolation.
a) Testing and surveillance
In the studies reviewed [10, 17, 24, 44-52], upscaling the antigen testing capacity is identified as a critical requirement while planning for exiting the lockdown. Countries that implemented testing at an early stage along with tracing and quarantine could effectively control the spread of COVID-19. For example, South Korea relied on `trace, test and treat' strategy to control the epidemic without imposing nationwide lockdown [53]. This implies the need for extensive testing capacity before considering reopening (refer to Table 6).
Review articles [10, 24, 48, 49, 51] included in this scoping review have emphasized the need for greater access to testing to allow the identification of new cases and clusters as early as possible. Massive testing of the healthy and infected population would be essential to inform policymakers about the effect of interventions during reopening.
Modelling studies included in the review [17, 21, 45-47, 54-57] have identified different effective testing strategies (listed in Table 6) to support opening, post lockdown.
Randazzo et al. [58] used wastewater surveillance and wastewater-based epidemiology to estimate the presence and prevalence of COVID-19 in communities. Findings suggest environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities as a tool for mapping high-risk areas during exit. Digital technology has been suggested for large-scale surveillance [59] and monitoring of epidemic [60] to support exit strategies in the reviewed studies.
b) Contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation
Improved health systems and public health capacity for contact tracing and ensuring quarantine and isolation are identified as prerequisites for opening up in the reviewed studies. This was necessary to identify and contain emerging clusters [26, 27, 61-64].

Kretzschmar et al. [61] have examined different scenarios of isolation and contact tracing settings in combination with social distancing levels for a safe exit strategy. Their modelling study results emphasize tracing non-household contacts during relaxation of restrictions. If not feasible due to public health system constraints, tracing and isolation of only household contacts is also found to significantly reduce the doubling time of the epidemic. A US-based modelling study [62] finds that increasing the capacity for detection, contact tracing and quarantine by at-least two folds would control the cases from rising during medium risk reopening (effective contact rate increased by three-five folds was considered as medium risk opening in the study).
Contact tracing using digital technologies has been suggested in some of the reviewed studies [24, 51, 65]. The acceptability of tracing apps has shown mixed results in this review. A study in Germany [66], found that people preferred to avoid mandatory tracing apps during exit strategy, while a cross-country study [67] from France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the US found strong support for use of apps.

confinement". This study finds "vertical confinement" would only be effective for all those over 50years of age but this would then include the population in the working-age group and thus is not recommended.
A modelling paper [77] based in the UK suggests the strategy of segmenting and shielding the vulnerable. Dividing the population into groups that are relatively homogenous in healthcare needs is defined as segmenting. Those above the age of 70years in receipt of government advice to shield/ in care homes/ receiving care at home are categorized as vulnerable. A study done in Nepal [44] recommends targeted closure and shielding of vulnerable and at-risk populations such as migrants, core case contacts, and family members. The exposure levels of household contacts/ contact with confirmed cases, exposure of border security forces, airport staff, health workers, and front-line workers should all be categorised in terms of high, medium, low, and no identifiable risk. This should be followed by active case management and monitoring based on asymptomatic and symptomatic cases.
The principle supporting the theory of protecting the vulnerable and allowing the healthy ones to carry out regular tasks assumes that it could help a majority of the population to return to normal. Risk classification tools to identify individuals who would require shielding during relaxation of interventions have been suggested in the studies [78, 79].

Ensuring strict physical distancing through lockdowns has helped to control the pandemic; however, this has had a profound ill effect on the economy. Reviewed studies examined various options for lifting physical distancing without increasing COVID-19 cases. We categorize these as below.
Segmenting and shielding at-risk population

Although effective, this strategy may not be acceptable and feasible in all contexts. As observed in study findings from Brazil [76], such a strict age selective containment would not be possible in multi-generational households, especially in LMICs. Similarly, the implications of this strategy need to be interpreted along with considerations for its practical feasibility and potential wider benefits and drawbacks.

Continuing the restrictions and ensuring physical distancing for at-risk population (those above 65years of age, people living in care institutions, and those with chronic conditions) for an extended period compared to other individuals in society has been suggested in reviewed studies. For example, a UK-based modelling [68] study found that if restrictions are continued only for older (60+) and vulnerable people, there will be reduction in hospitalization by 50%, while if restrictions are continued for 50+ population with chronic diseases, the reduction will be by 57%. Few other studies based in the UK [69-71], France [26, 72], China [73], Pakistan [74], and Italy [75] have suggested a similar age-selective restriction strategy for opening up. A study from Brazil [76] refers to age-specific confinement as "vertical

Categorizing high-risk places
From the studies reviewed, mapping of places with high transmission risk, super-spreading events, hotspots, and predicting mobility patterns is suggested before opening [80]. This information would help in designing policies to keep active surveillance of such places or to keep these areas closed while lifting the lockdown.
A review article [81] based on global data has identified indoor settings linked to increased risk of COVID-19 transmission. Large numbers of cases were from hospitals and elderly care settings in Europe. Other clusters with more than 100 cases included large religious gatherings, food processing plants, shopping places, and large

Misra et al. BMC Public Health (2022) 22:488

Page 12 of 16

cohabiting settings (worker dormitories, prisons, and ships). Settings with 50-100 cases included weddings, sports venues, bars, shopping places, and workplaces. Only a small number of clusters were related to schools and cases were most often reported among teachers and staff. An observational study [82] from eight high-income countries concurred with these findings.
Other studies [83-85] based in high-income countries have identified schools as low-risk settings with minimal effect on transmission after their opening compared to other indoor settings.

b) Use of Face Masks
The universal use of face masks after relaxing restrictions has been suggested as an effective exit strategy. Wearing masks by at least 60% of people was found to be a reasonable public health goal and at the same time a plausible strategy. It was found to be much easier than enforcing physical distancing in a modelling study in Australia [91]. This study found using only face masks reduced infections by 54% while using only physical distancing reduced infection by 24.7%. Especially in dense areas, face mask use is effective.

A UK-based modelling study [86] examined the effect of opening schools along with removing restrictions on different occupation groups and concluded increased transmission, i.e., R0 above one (the basic reproduction number, R0 is the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical case of an infection in a population where everyone is susceptible [12]). Continued restriction on recreational activities (e.g., restaurants and bars) during exiting has been suggested in a modelling study based in highincome countries [87].
Daily contact rates
Some modelling studies have suggested a combination of optimal daily contacts to bring R below one. A study based in the UK [88] suggests that while opening up, if the daily contact rate of an individual is maintained at five-six people, R would be reduced below one. For a contact rate of six-seven people, R may increase above one. For eightnine people contact rate, health system capacity would be insufficient and may require another lockdown.
Creating social bubbles
A UK-based modelling study [89] examined the use of social bubbles or contact clustering to reduce contacts while opening from a lockdown. This means that two households would have exclusive contact and form a social bubble. Findings suggest that such a strategy can reduce COVID-related fatality by 42% as opposed to unrestricted socializing. The study shows epidemic risk can be further reduced if the transmission risk within the bubble is minimised.
In the reviewed studies, the importance of continuing some form of physical distancing during exit has been reiterated. E.g., one of the modelling studies [90] concludes sensitivity of the second wave to physical distancing rather than movements in the UK. Thus, indicating a need for physical distancing while opening up.

Another study [92] has shown that face mask use by infectious as well as the susceptible individuals is most effective as it reduces infection chances to 10% compared to 90% if none were wearing a mask. Wang et al. [93] conducted a modelling study using data from China, Italy, UK, and USA concluding the most effective exit strategy would be a combination of physical distancing and face mask use along with intense monitoring of the epidemic.
c) Relaxing travel restrictions
During opening up, a sustainable border control policy should be in sync with internal control measures. A modelling study [94] based on global data suggests opening of borders of countries and states where COVID-19 spread has already been successfully contained by internal measures. Pre-departure screening and testing on arrival are sufficient to keep imported cases in check without any border/travel restrictions [95]. Another modelling study [96] based in the EU correlates a mobility model to passenger air traffic and finds unconstrained mobility would have significantly accelerated the spreading of COVID19. This was especially so in Central Europe, Spain, and France. Network epidemiology can inform political decision making and help countries exit from total lockdown.
Discussion Two years since the first outbreak of COVID-19, and after almost a year and a half of varying restrictive measures, countries had begun to open up from lockdowns in mid-2021. Countries that implemented moderate to severe measures to control the COVID-19 transmission faced challenges. In particular, to devise a safe exit plan, which would limit the transmission and have minimum social and economic costs. Some countries have been reimposing restrictions in light of increasing cases and emergence of newer variants in November-December 2021. Synthesis of the available evidence on exit strategies

can help in policy decision making and analysis of this was found lacking.
This scoping review was undertaken to understand the different strategies that countries adopted to exit from lockdowns to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and to document the effects of these exit strategies.
The majority of the studies adhering to the inclusion criteria were from the high-income countries (68%) and were based on epidemiological modelling exercises (76%), and therefore the results need to be interpreted with caution. We have described the exit strategies around the themes of timing, processes, and supporting conditions for exit answering key questions about when, how, and what.
We find the relaxation of restrictions is most appropriate when there is a decrease in the number of cases after the peak period for at least 2 weeks. This would prevent the health system from being overwhelmed. Determinants such as reduction in the reproduction number, a smaller susceptible population, considerations for the economy, livelihoods, and health system capacity are additional considerations before opening up. This corresponds to the WHO recommendation [97] to undertake a situational assessment of the intensity of transmission and health system capacity, before deciding to lift restrictive measures. WHO's guidance on implementing and adjusting the public health and social measures, emphasizes the importance of flexible decision making for exiting at local levels, in coordination with neighbouring areas at the sub-national as well as the national level [97].
Most of the reviewed studies suggest phase-wise exit to be more effective compared to a hard exit or cyclic lockdowns, considering public health, clinical and social factors. WHO has repeatedly suggested [97, 98] slow, controlled and step-wise relaxation of measures. Moreover, an interval of 2 weeks has been recommended to identify any adverse effects of such measures and adjust the next steps accordingly.
This review suggests the importance of sufficient testing capacity and the need for extensive testing as necessary conditions while exiting. Almost all studies recommend continued use of non-pharmaceutical interventions in different combinations when exiting from a lockdown, which need to be in place even after optimal vaccination coverage has been attained. This is also in line with the WHO recommendation [97] for continuously monitoring the transmission levels and adopting appropriate public health measures, even when vaccination has begun. The studies reviewed also suggest the need for the maintenance of strong infection control measures

in health establishments. For international travellers coming from countries with an active outbreak, strict quarantine rules should continue. Strengthening the public health system for detection, tracing, and quarantine should continue till vaccine coverage improves.
Adopting a multi-pronged strategy consisting of these different approaches as per the context is recommended by most studies we reviewed. In the highincome countries, there is a relatively larger proportion of formal sector workers and better health system capacity. Here, we note a reliance on increased testing capacity, and better surveillance to aid the phase-wise opening. In the low-and-middle-income countries, while the principles for opening up remain the same, studies have additionally suggested zonal lockdowns, local and context-specific identification of high-risk places and vulnerable individuals, and more adherence to non-pharmaceutical measures.
This scoping review has a few limitations. First, only two databases were included in the search strategy, likely missing out on other published evidence. However, we expect to have covered the majority of published studies. Second, the review has included studies on the effects of exit strategies on COVID19 related outcomes. Effects on other outcomes such as social and economic aspects were not included. Effects of vaccination coverage on opening up weren't studied as literature on this was in early stages while undertaking the review. Recent literature does point to significant effects of existing COVID vaccines on reducing disease severity (hospitalization and deaths) [99], and on newer variants such as Omicron [100]. Improving vaccination coverage thus becomes an important component of exit strategy. However, due to global vaccine divide, `vaccination' may not be a feasible strategy for many countries at the moment. Further research needs to be undertaken to understand effects of vaccines on exiting from lockdowns in different contexts.
Conclusion Different approaches for exit strategies have been adopted by countries or suggested via modelling exercises in the review findings. These vary from imposing a phase-wise exit to a hard exit. Other strategies which consider vaccination coverage include constant partial lockdowns or a cyclic strategy for lockdown and relaxation till optimum immunity is achieved. Out of these, the phase-wise exit with continuation of non-pharmaceutical interventions appears to be optimal, as per the review findings.

Abstract
Background: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection occurring in RT-PCR negative individuals represent a poorly characterized cohort with important infection control connotations. While household and community-based studies have evaluated seroprevalence of antibody and transmission dynamics in this group, workplace-based data is currently unavailable. Methods: A cohort study was carried out in July 2021, during and immediately following the peak of the 3­ rd wave of COVID-19 in Sri Lanka, prior to mass vaccination. A total of 92 unvaccinated individuals between the ages of 17-65 years were purposively sampled from an office and two factory settings. The selected cohort that had been exposed to RT-PCR positive cases in the workplace was tested RT-PCR negative. Serological samples collected six weeks post exposure were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody.
Results: The seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in the overall cohort was 63.04% (58/92). Seroprevalences in the office setting, factory setting 1 and factory setting 2 were 69.2% (9/13), 55.7% (34/61) and 83.33% (15/18), respectively. Primary risk factor associated with seropositivity was face to face contact with no mask for>15 min (p<0.024, Odds Ratio (OR); 5.58, 95%CI;1.292- 25.65). Individuals with workspace exposure had significantly higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than those who did not (percentage neutralization in assay 63.3% (SD:21)vs 45.7% (SD:20), p=0.0042), as did individuals who engaged socially without protective measures (62.4 (SD:21.6)% vs 49.7 (SD:21)%, p=0.026).
Conclusion: There was a high seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies among RT-PCR negative contacts in workplace settings in Sri Lanka. Higher levels of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection than estimated based on RT-PCR positive contact data indicate need for targeted infection control measures in these settings during future outbreaks.

October 2020 with only 3396 cases, 13 deaths, and a low case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.38, following strict lockdown measures. The second wave, from October 2020 to April 2021 gave rise to 92,341 cases and 591 deaths with a case fatality rate of 0.64. Lockdown measures, case isolation and contact tracing were extensively performed. The third wave starting in April 2021 gave rise to a national health and socio-economic crisis with 445,336 new cases, 13,139 deaths and a high case fatality rate of 2.95, with the delta variant (B.1.617.2) being the dominant viral strain responsible for the high transmission and increased death rates [2, 3]. Restricted movement directives were in place; however, allowance was made for maintenance of agriculture, essential services and export production for economic reasons. While social interaction among the population was minimal during this time, work-based interaction in some sectors continued due to economic needs. As of January 2021 the population seroprevalence of antibodies in the commercial hub of Colombo, where much of the case load was concentrated, was 24.5% [4].
Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection has been the primary focus of global attention. However, asymptomatic infection is important as asymptomatic individuals i) can transmit the infection [5, 6] and ii) affect the estimation of the true disease burden in a community and therefore Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) and basic reproduction number (R0) [7], which indicate how well a community is dealing with an outbreak. Current meta analyses indicate that asymptomatic infection accounts for 20-40% of COVID-19 infection worldwide [8].
Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown in both RT-PCR positive [9] and RT-PCR negative individuals [10] the latter confirmed by serological testing, though studies remain sparse. Investigations into serological evidence of infection in RT-PCR negative asymptomatic individuals is sparse [11].
COVID-19 transmission dynamics are affected by environmental factors like indoor/outdoor ventilation, contact patterns (proximity to index case, time, duration and frequency of the exposure) and socio-economic factors (prolonged working hours, indoor crowding, job security) [12]. Scientific investigation evaluating risk behaviors associated with the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown face to face contact with the index case to be the dominant independent risk factor [13, 14]. Apart from COVID-19, history reveals that industrial settings carry a high risk of rapid transmission of airborne infectious diseases such as TB [15] and influenza [16] due to risk of close proximity of individuals, high population density, poor ventilation and longer working hours.
We set out to evaluate the seroprevalence of SARSCoV-2 neutralizing antibodies among a population of RT-PCR negative close contacts of RT-PCR positive

individuals in workplace settings in the Kandy district where there were documented outbreaks of COVID-19 during the ­3rd wave (starting from May 2021) immediately prior to the national vaccine rollout.
Our objectives were to ascertain the seroprevalence and level of neutralizing antibodies generated in response to asymptomatic RT-PCR negative infection and to evaluate the association of seropositivity and level of neutralization with risk behaviours and risk work environments.
Methods
Study population The study was conducted during July 2021, during and immediately following the peak of the ­3rd wave of COVID-19, which was the major outbreak in Sri Lanka, immediately before the national COVID-19 vaccine rollout. A total of 92 unvaccinated individuals between the ages of 17-65 years working in three institutions; two factory settings (factory-1 and factory-2) and an office setting (office-1) were purposively recruited for the study with informed written consent. The selected individuals had been exposed to RT-PCR positive individuals in the workplace and had been screened during routine community-based, government mandated screening, for COVID-19 at the appropriate time following exposure by RT-PCR and confirmed as negative. RT-PCR for all samples had been performed at the National Hospital Kandy Virology laboratory on nasopharyngeal swabs collected as part of the national community screening and diagnostic programme run by the Provincial and Regional Directorate of Health Services. RT-PCR was performed using the RealStar SARS-CoV RT-PCR kit which used gene targets E gene (CoV specific) and S gene (SARS CoV specific) for diagnosis. Samples with both target gene amplification (Ct<40) with valid controls were considered positive. Samples with both target genes negative with valid controls, were considered negative. Blood sample collection for serological testing for this study was done approximately 4-6 weeks from known exposure to detect maximum antibody responses. Figure 1, 2 and 3 show the timeline of events and screening dates at the three selected locations in relation to the ongoing wave of COVID-19 at the time.
Briefly, in factory -1, a medium sized food production factory with 275 employees, an initial exposure event occurred at the end of March 2021 with detection of a single case. Initial screening of five close contacts in April 2021 revealed an additional case. On May ­8th, as case numbers were increasing with the peak of the 3­ rd wave of infection in the country, all remaining employees were screened by rapid antigen testing revealing an additional 53 cases. The 222 rapid antigen negative individuals were screened by RT-PCR and `confirmed'

as negative. A convenience sample of 61 individuals from this cohort were sampled for antibody testing at the beginning of July 2021.
In factory -2, a medium sized garment factory with 621 employees, 200 individuals were tested by RT-PCR in early May 2021 as they were either symptomatic, first contacts of PCR positive cases at home, or newly recruited. Of those tested 44 were found to be positive while 156 were found to be negative. Individuals with negative RT-PCR were followed up and screened with either repeat RT-PCR or rapid antigen testing if they developed symptoms over the next 2 weeks.

A convenience sample of 18 individuals who had remained asymptomatic and had no history of a positive antigen or RT-PCR test, were sampled for antibody testing at the end of July, 2021.
In office setting-1, the third test site with a total of 170 employees, two employees were diagnosed as RT-PCR positive in mid-April and mid-May respectively. Screening of two contacts of the initial case done in April gave no further positives while screening of 25 close contacts of the 2­ ndcase done on the 1­ 8th of May 2021, revealed 6 cases and 19 negative individuals. Of the 19 negative individuals, 8 were vaccinated and 11 were not. Blood

Fig.2 Timeline at Factory 2. The diagram shows the timeline of events related to COVID-19 in Sri Lanka, and the investigation of COVID19 cases and contacts as well as participant recruitment at Factory 2 which is a large-scale garment factory

samples from the initial two negative contacts and the latter 11 (total 13) unvaccinated contacts were collected for antibody detection at the beginning of July 2021.
All the participants were asymptomatic at the time of sample collection and had no history of being RT-PCR positive or had any history of COVID-19 suggestive symptoms during the preceding months. Basic demographic details such as age, gender and the date of sample collection for RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 and detailed exposure history (working in the same workspace for>2-3 h with and without ventilation, working in the same air conditioned space for>2-3 h with no other ventilation, face to face contact with no mask for>15 min, eat/socialize together with no protective measures, travel together in enclosed space<30 min, travel together in enclosed space>30 min, share items at meals/clothing/other) were recorded. A follow-up telephone interview was conducted to cross check details filled in the questionnaire including interview of 35 RTPCR positive individuals from the same settings to cross evaluate the accuracy of responses given by RT-PCR negative individuals.

Blood samples were obtained to detect the presence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using the Genscriptc PassTM SARS-CoV-2 neutralization Antibody Detection kit (GenScript USA/ Nanjing GenScript Diagnostics Technology Co., Ltd., Version RUO for US.1.0). Separated serum samples were stored at -80 °C until testing. Testing was carried out according to manufacturer's instructions. Percentage inhibition was obtained using the surrogate viral neutralization assay [17]. A cutoff of 30% neutralization (% inhibition) was taken as positive (seroconversion) as recommended by manufacturer. Level of antibody expressed as a percentage neutralization was calculated for each sample.
Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism (8.4.2. 679, 2020). Percentage neutralization was compared using Mann Whitney test (due to non-normal distribution of values), and association between categorical variables was evaluated using the chi-square

test. Multiple groups were compared with the Kruskal Wallis test and Dunns Post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. Forward and backward stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission [18].
Results
Demographic characteristics Demographic characteristics of the cohort are shown in Table 1.
Seroprevalence of SARSCoV2 specific neutralizing antibodies The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in the overall cohort was 63.04% (58/92). Seroprevalence in factory-1 was 55.7 (34/61), in factory-2 was 83.33% (15/18) and in office-1 was 69.2%

(9/13). The mean antibody level ( inhibition) of seropositives was 40.8% (95% CI: 26.25-55.36) in office 1, 68.50% (95% CI: 62.02-74.97) in factory 1 and 49.8% (95% CI:38.40-61.34) in factory 2. A comparison of the level of neutralizing antibody (percentage inhibition of assay) in each setting is shown in Fig. 4
Comparison of mean antibody level of the seropositive individuals between study sites revealed a significantly higher level of antibodies (Kruskall Wallis test, p<0.0001) in individuals at factory -1 compared to both factory-2 (Dunns test, p=0.01) and office-1 (Dunns test, p<0.0001). In addition, seropositive individuals from factory-2 had a higher level of neutralizing antibodies compared to office-1 though this did not reach statistical significance. These results reveal that despite having a lower overall seroprevalence than factory-2 and office-1, factory-1 showed the highest levels of neutralizing antibodies between the three institutions while both factory

settings had individuals with higher levels of neutralizing antibodies compared to the office setting (Fig. 4).
We then analyzed the behavioral trends associated with seropositivity to ascertain which behavior patterns were associated with seropositivity in these settings.
Seropositivity and risk behaviours The primary behavior associated with seropositivity in univariate analysis was having face to face contact with no mask for>15 min (chi square test d­ f2, p<0.024). There was no association between seropositivity and level of workspace exposure (evaluated based on number of hours and ventilation during exposure), exposure during eating/socializing together with no protective measures or exposure by sharing items at meals/clothing/other with RT-PCR positive individuals. As both factories provided transport to and from the workplace for employees, exposure during travel was also evaluated for association with seropositivity, however, gave no significant result. Binary logistic modelling gave a similar result with no further significant risk factors identified. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for each of the evaluated risk factor are given in Table 2.
A deeper analysis of seropositive individuals in each of exposure category is shown in Fig. 5. Although face to face contact for>15 min with no mask was a significant risk factor for seropositivity, there was no

significant difference in the level of neutralizing antibody between the seropositive individuals who had such exposure (60.9% (SD:24.3)) and those who did not (58.8%, SD:21.4) (Fig. 5A). In contrast, seropositive individuals with workspace exposure (same workspace for 2-3 h with ventilation, without ventilation or in air conditioned rooms with no other ventilation) had significantly higher neutralizing antibody levels compared to those who had no work place exposure (63.3% (SD:21) vs 45.7(SD:20.2)%, Mann Whitney test, p=0.0042) (Fig. 5B). Similarly, individuals who were seropositive had engaged socially (eating/ socializing together with known COVID-19 positive individuals) without protective measures and these individuals had significantly higher neutralizing antibody levels compared to those who did not engage socially (62.4% (SD:21.6) vs 49.7% (SD:21), Mann Whitney test, p=0.026) (Fig. 5C). Traveling in enclosed space showed a similar trend with those who did so having a mean neutralizing antibody level of 63.9% (SD:22.7) while those who did not travel in enclosed spaces had a mean level of 53.3% (SD:19.8) though this difference did not reach statistical significance (Mann Whitney, p=0.063) (Fig. 5D).
Having identified risk behaviors/ factors associated with seropositivity, we investigated the demographic characteristics of those who engaged in risk behaviors (Fig. 6.).
Validity of responses A telephone interview carried out including 35 SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR positive workers from the factory setting who were index cases of the study cohort revealed that some responses regarding exposure history given

by the RT-PCR negative study cohort may not be reliable. For example, only 25% (23/92) of the RT-PCR negative group responded that they had shared items of food during meals and / or clothing while 88.57% (31/35) of the RT-PCR positive group said otherwise. Moreover, only 5.43% (5/92) of RT-PCR negative group claimed to have worked in same air-conditioned space for>2-3 h with no other ventilation whereas 40% (14/35) in the RT-PCR positive group stated the opposite. A significant difference was observed between the contradictory responses given by the two groups regarding sharing items during meals/clothing/other (p<0.001, OR=23.25, 95% CI-7.273 to 64.62) and working in the same air-conditioned space (p<0.001, OR=11.6,95% CI -2.295 to 5.970).
Overall, we show that while>15 min of face-to-face contact without mask was the primary risk factor for being seropositive in this cohort, seropositive individuals had higher antibody levels if they had high risk workspace exposure (>2-3 h in the same space) or engaged socially with RT-PCR positive individuals without protective measures. Telephone interviews with RT-PCR positive employees revealed that the number of those engaging in risk behavior in the contact group may be underestimated.
Discussion We demonstrate a high seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative contact population in three workplace settings in the Kandy district of Sri Lanka during the third wave of COVID-19 (July 2021) immediately prior to vaccine roll-out. This is the first data from industrial/ office settings available globally to the best of our knowledge. The

Fig.6 Demographic characteristics of individuals by risk behaviors. Females were more likely to have some degree of workspace exposure to a positive case during working hours compared to males (chi sq test, p<0.001, OR 8.318, 95% CI 2.891-22.87) (A) and were significantly more likely to eat/socialize together with no protective measures (p<0.001, OR 6.99, 95% CI 2.389-19.05) (B). In contrast, males were more likely to share items/ meals/clothing/ with one another (p=0.018, OR 3.314, 95% CI 1.245-8.66) (C) in the study cohort. Moreover, having an education level of Ordinary Level examination or above was associated with being more likely to have face to face contact with no mask for>15 min (p=0.029, OR 3.287,95% CI 1.074-10.28) (D)

workplace seroprevalence of 63.04% is markedly higher than the community and household seroprevalence data shown in other studies worldwide. A community based study by Ng et al. carried out between Jan 23 and April 3, 2020 in Singapore on close contacts who were either PCR negative or asymptomatic and untested gave a 3.8% seropositivity [14] while a study from China conducted between 20 January and 29 February 2020 on PCR negative household contacts gave a 23.6% seroprevalence [19]. Weis S. et al. reported a 5.1% seroprevalence in PCR negative close contacts from ­12th to ­22nd May, 2020 in a quarantined village in Germany 6 weeks following a COVID-19 outbreak. [20]. These present the few data sets available on antibody seroprevalence in PCR negative study cohorts

and are early data sets that are household/ community based. The seroprevalence, which included both RT-PCR positive and negative individuals, in the general population of densely populated Colombo in January 2021 was shown to be 24.5% which is<50% of that demonstrated in our study cohort, which comprised workers primarily from semi-urban and rural areas of the Kandy district. Our results highlight the significant transmission of asymptomatic infection occurring in workplace settings compared to community settings, particularly in densely populated factory settings. Meta analysis of overall seroprevalence (not limited to asymptomatic/ RT-PCR negative individuals) across 968 studies which included 74 countries with 202 prevalence data showed that though general

Karunathilake et al. BMC Public Health (2022) 22:1961

Page 10 of 12

population seroprevalence was approximately 4.5%, a wide variation existed in specific populations, with a high 59% prevalence in persons in assisted living and long term care facilities [21]. Seroprevalence was also higher in people aged 18-64 compared to over 65 (RR1.27, 95% CI 1.11- 1.45). These findings indicate that higher seroprevalence can be expected in working age individuals in high population density settings consistent with virus transmission dynamics. Given that our data represents seroprevalence at a later (mid 2021) stage of the pandemic in workplace settings where deficiencies in infection control would have occurred, the seroprevalence we have found appears reasonable, though disturbingly high. In addition to seroprevalence we show that neutralizing antibody levels are also higher in the densely populated factory settings compared to the office setting indicating that the level of exposure may have an impact on the strength of the humoral immune response even in asymptomatic infection.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the only study to evaluate the level of neutralizing antibodies in RTPCR negative contacts. Therefore, comparison of these results in either community or workplace settings is not possible. However, comparison with results from two studies carried out in Sri Lanka, utilizing the same surrogate viral neutralization assay in symptomatic and vaccinated populations show that, the mean antibody level in our study cohort (mean antibody level:59.38% 95%, CI: 53.61- 65.16) was similar to that reached with symptomatic infection prior to vaccination (median antibody level: 63.2%, IQR: 9.9- 95.2%) [22] or with single dose vaccination (median antibody level: 69.42%, IQR: 54.0981.54% [23] though the statistical significance of these results cannot be tested at this time. These findings suggest that exposure, particularly exposure in confined settings like factory 1 (mean antibody level: 68.50% (95% CI: 62.02-74.97), can result in significant immune responses, despite being both asymptomatic and RT-PCR negative.
Among evaluated risk factors, the only identified risk factor for seropositivity was having face to face contact with no mask for>15 min. Sample size limitation may have impacted these findings. A study carried out in China demonstrated that transmission among household cases was associated with exposure to multiple cases, face to face communication with an index case for 30 min or longer and sharing a vehicle with an index case. However, no independent association was observed between SARS-CoV-2 transmission and either indirect contact, meal sharing, and lavatory co-usage [14]. A similar study carried out in South Korea showed face-to-face conversations, eating together, and using the same toilet with COVID-19 patient, were significantly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection and sharing objects with SARS-CoV-2 infected persons was not associated with

acquiring the infection. Moreover, face-to-face conversations with a COVID-19 infected individual was revealed to be an independent risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 transmission (OR: 4.11) [13]. These studies strongly corroborate our findings. In addition, we show that although the evaluated risk factors of workspace exposure, and exposure without protective measures during socializing/ eating did not reach statistical significance for simple seropositivity, such exposure showed higher levels of neutralizing antibodies. These findings also support the likelihood that increased level of exposure is associated with increased humoral antibody response even in asymptomatic infection. This is the first-time neutralizing antibody level has been evaluated in relation to exposure risk factors. This evidence strongly supports the recommendations to reduce COVID-19 transmission, presented by the Three Cs Strategy of WHO (avoid i. crowded places ii. close-contact settings iii. confined and enclosed spaces) and the CDC, which encourage the public to wear face masks, maintain physical distance from other persons, limit in-person contacts, avoid nonessential indoor spaces, protect essential workers by providing adequate personal protective equipment, follow safe work practices and to increase air ventilation and environmental disinfection in the workspace [24].
Male: female ratio in office-1, factory-1 and factory-2 were 9:4, 8:53 and 1:2 respectively. Demographic characteristics such as gender and education level were found to be associated with increasing the risk behavior for potential exposure for COVID-19. Females were more likely to eat and socialize together with no protective measures while males were tended to share items at meals/clothing/other. More educated population who had completed their studies beyond GCE O/L seemed to be sharing items/ meals/clothing/other and maintaining face to face contact with no mask for>15 min than the less educated population. These results highlight the socio-cultural differences in habits that need to be specifically addressed if consistent changes in behavior are to be brought about and that possibly health literacy is more important than formal education in preventing COVID-19. Gender based differences in attitudes towards pandemic restrictions have been consistently shown over 8 countries with females being more likely to agree and comply with restrictions on behavior [25]. Here we show that certain behavior patterns in some communal settings do not conform to largescale evaluations. Investigation of ingrained etiquette in a given setting and addressing these at a ground level are likely to be necessary for good infection control practice in individual institutions.
There was significant disparity between the responses given by PCR positive and negative groups regarding the exposure history. It is possible that the significantly

Karunathilake et al. BMC Public Health (2022) 22:1961

Page 11 of 12

higher likelihood of risk behavior seen in the PCR positive group was the reason they became infected. However, it is also possible and indeed more likely that the PCR negative participants were hesitant to reveal their true exposure history, possibly due to fear of repercussions from the workplace administration for not following guidelines issued by the government to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the level of stigma at that point of time in the society and not having psychological safety to reveal the truth may have discouraged them from revealing pertinent facts related to their exposure history. Therefore, underestimation of risk behavior is likely. This is another area that needs to be addressed when improving infection control by creating a non-threatening environment, which empowers employees to understand and report risk behaviors.
The primary strength of this study is that it is the only data currently available showing evidence of transmission in RT-PCR negative contacts in workplace settings. In addition to seropositivity, the added dimension of level of neutralizing antibodies and the association of exposure factors to both give new insights into the relationship between exposure and induced immunity. The main weakness it the small sample size due to practical restrictions, which limited the number of tests we could perform at each study site. Increasing both the number of samples as well as study sites would have provided a clearer picture of transmission dynamics in different workplace settings,
Collectively our findings indicate high levels of SARSCoV-2 transmission occur in workplaces, and these individuals are not included in the total case count of a country or region unless seroprevalence studies are performed. This has several implications. First, the total number of COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka is likely to be much higher than current estimates. The corollary of which is that the true case fatality rate for Sri Lanka during the ­3rd wave is likely lower than 2.55%, which is above the global average (1.7%). Second, while workplaces, particularly industrial settings were kept functional during the lockdowns to maintain economic solvency, there was inadequate preparation of the workplaces and the employees for infection control. Third, the subsequent vaccine rollout that covered the working population has resulted in higher levels of immunity than just the twodose regime would give as many workers in industrial settings are likely to already have seroconverted despite negative PCR results. The subsequent 4­ th wave of infection by the delta and omicron variants and the current ­3rd dose deployment island wide mean that fairly high antibody levels can be expected in this population. This is good news for subsequent waves with new variants as high levels of at least partially neutralizing antibodies can be expected in the workforce.

Further work exploring the adequacy of infection control measures and adherence to country and company policy in ground level workplaces is needed especially to flatten the curve until the effect of vaccine role out is gained. COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic we face. The need of developing economies running without being damaged by prolonged lockdowns highlights the need for policy and structural changes that ensure continuous functioning of workplaces.
Conclusion There was a high seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in the workplace setting in Sri Lanka in asymptomatic, RT-PCR negative contacts. True SARS-CoV-2 infection rates are underestimated and transmission and control of infection in workplace settings is an area that requires specific attention.

Abstract
Background: Steroids have been shown to reduce inflammation, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) and lung edema. Based on evidence from clinical trials, steroids are widely used in severe COVID-19. However, the effects of steroids on pulmonary gas volume and blood volume in this group of patients are unexplored.
Objective: Profiting by dual-energy computed tomography (DECT), we investigated the relationship between the use of steroids in COVID-19 and distribution of blood volume as an index of impaired HPV. We also investigated whether the use of steroids influences lung weight, as index of lung edema, and how it affects gas distribution.
Methods: Severe COVID-19 patients included in a single-center prospective observational study at the intensive care unit at Uppsala University Hospital who had undergone DECT were enrolled in the current study. Patients' cohort was divided into two groups depending on the administration of steroids. From each patient's DECT, 20 gas volume maps and the corresponding 20 blood volume maps, evenly distributed along the cranial-caudal axis, were analyzed. As a proxy for HPV, pulmonary blood volume distribution was analyzed in both the whole lung and the hypoinflated areas. Total lung weight, index of lung edema, was estimated.
Results: Sixty patients were analyzed, whereof 43 received steroids. Patients not exposed to steroids showed a more extensive non-perfused area (19% vs 13%, p<0.01) and less homogeneous pulmonary blood volume of hypoinflated areas (kurtosis: 1.91 vs 2.69, p<0.01), suggesting a preserved HPV compared to patients treated with steroids. Moreover, patients exposed to steroids showed a significantly lower lung weight (953 gr vs 1140 gr, p=0.01). A reduction in alveolar-arterial difference of oxygen followed the treatment with steroids (322±106 mmHg at admission vs 267±99 mmHg at DECT, p=0.04).
Conclusions: The use of steroids might cause impaired HPV and might reduce lung edema in severe COVID-19. This is consistent with previous findings in other diseases. Moreover, a reduced lung weight, as index of decreased lung edema, and a more homogeneous distribution of gas within the lung were shown in patients treated with steroids.

elucidation of many molecular mechanisms subtending the disease [3-5]. However, despite the prompt recognition of the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 on different organs and functions [6], the pathophysiological mechanisms affecting the respiratory function still remain to be thoroughly understood. This difficulty derives from the fact that the primary function of the respiratory system, i.e., the gas exchange, is based on the interplay of two different sub-systems [7], alveolar ventilation and pulmonary capillary perfusion that deal with different physiological mechanisms and are associated with different structural features.
Numerous drugs have been tested as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents [8]. Among them, steroids (i.e., dexamethasone 6 mg for 10 days) have been demonstrated to improve survival [9, 10] and are therefore widely used in severe COVID-19. Despite their effectiveness and well-known pleiotropic effects [11], the pharmacodynamics of steroids on COVID-19 lungs have not yet been widely reported. Based on the previous literature, a steroidinduced dysregulation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) [12, 13] as well as a reduction in lung edema [14] can be hypothesized to occur in COVID-19 patients.
Already in the early stages of the pandemic, lung perfusion abnormalities were reported based on dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) [15]. Contrast-enhanced DECT is a powerful lung imaging method based on two concurrent X-ray energy spectra. Taking advantage of the different attenuation profiles of different substances, including iodine contrast, DECT can simultaneously characterize regional distribution of gas and blood volume in the lung parenchyma [16, 17].
The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of steroids on regional distribution of pulmonary gas and blood volume as indices of shunting affecting oxygenation in critically ill patients with severe COVID19 using data from contrast-enhanced DECT.
The study had three main aims: firstly, to examine the possibility of visualize pharmacodynamical mechanisms of drugs on lung parenchyma using DECT; secondly, to investigate the association between the use of steroids and HPV in COVID-19 lungs and therefore examine the possible influence of steroids on ventilation/perfusion matching; and thirdly, to explore the association between steroids therapy and magnitude of lung edema and consequently the effects on regional distribution of gas volume and oxygenation.
Methods
Study population We analyzed clinically indicated DECT performed on patients included in a prospective observational

single-center study of critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Uppsala University Hospital in Sweden between April 7, 2020, and January 18, 2021. The study was approved by the National Ethical Review Agency (EPM; No. 2020-01623) and performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent revisions. Patients older than 18 years with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV2 on nasal swab specimen and available chest DECT performed during the intensive care stay were analyzed. All patients were not vaccinated for SARS-CoV2. The scans were acquired on clinical indication in static lung conditions, covering the whole lung parenchyma in supine position (see Fig. 1). Comprehensive clinical data were collected at ICU admission and the day of DECT. A subgroup analysis was conducted, dividing the sampled population in two groups: the group of patients not treated with steroids (No-Steroids group) and the one treated with steroids (Steroids group). In June 2020, the early report of the RECOVERY dexamethasone trial [9, 10] was published and the treatment guidelines of the disease were changed accordingly. Consequently, all patients recruited after June 16, 2020, were treated with steroids, forming up the group labeled "Steroids." Patients chronically treated with steroids for reasons different from COVID-19 but that received, during their ICU stay, a steroids dose comparable to or higher than Dexamethasone 6 mg/day were included in the Steroids group.
DECT image analysis Dual-energy computed tomography was always performed in supine position. For each raw DECT dataset, routine material-specific DECT maps were generated using a secondary workstation (Syngo.via Multimodality Workplace; Siemens Medical Solutions) that applied a three-material decomposition algorithm [18]. Two different series of images were selected and used for further analysis: the gas distribution (pulmonary gas volume) maps and the corresponding blood distribution (pulmonary blood volume) maps (see Fig. 1). Twenty images evenly spaced along the cranial-caudal axis and located between the apex and the diaphragmatic dome were analyzed (see Fig. 1). A manual segmentation of the lung parenchyma was applied, and big vessels, heart and mediastinal structures were excluded from the subsequent analysis. As regard to the pulmonary gas volume maps, the Hounsfield units (HU) range of - 1000 (gas) to+100 (non-aerated lung) was considered, as done in previous studies (see Fig. 2). Four lung compartments were then defined [19]: hyperinflated (- 1000 to - 800 HU), normoinflated (- 800 to - 500 HU), poorly inflated (- 500 to - 100 HU) and non-inflated (- 100 to+100 HU) lung. As regard to the pulmonary blood volume

Pulmonary blood volume maps were characterized by a HU range of - 100 to+150 HU. To assess hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, pulmonary blood volume distribution was assessed for the whole lung and for the hypoinflated lung, the latter characterized by poorly inflated and non-inflated lung regions (HU between - 500 and+100). A region of interest for hypoinflated lung (Hypoinflation ROI) was obtained extrapolating hypoinflated areas (Hypoinflation Map) from the pulmonary gas volume map. Hence, the hypoinflated ROI was applied to pulmonary blood volume map to analyze blood volume distribution of the hypoinflated areas

maps, we studied the range between - 100 and+150 HU (see Fig. 2). Based on previous studies [20-22], zero HU was set as a limit between non-perfused (HU0) and perfused lung compartment (HU>0). Each compartment was separately computed and expressed as c­ m2 and as percentage of the total lung volume in each map [22]. From the bell-shaped curves characterizing the HU distribution of perfused blood volume maps, kurtosis was calculated as measure of both dispersion and morphology of the curves (see Fig. 3A) as done in previous studies [23-26]. Kurtosis belongs to the big chapter of the measures of variance, and it is commonly used to quantify both dispersion and morphology of density histograms derived from computed tomography images. A reduced kurtosis corresponds to a decreased homogeneity of pulmonary blood volume. The latter has been previously interpreted as indirect index of HPV efficiency [27]: a low homogeneity of pulmonary blood volume (low kurtosis) corresponding to a preserved HPV. To further assess the relation between and HPV, where a reduced pulmonary blood volume is expected in the hypoinflated lung, pulmonary blood volume was separately assessed for the whole lung and for the hypoinflated areas, the latter characterized by poorly inflated and non-inflated lung

The Wilcoxon rank-sum test (=0.05) was used as a nonparametric test in the case of independent observations. Fisher's exact test (=0.05) was used to test statistically significant differences in the case of categorical variables.

Results
Study population Sixty patients affected by severe COVID-19 and in need of intensive care were analyzed in the study (see Table 1). The mean age was of 63±9 years and 20% were women. At ICU admission, the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to inspired oxygen fraction at the day of the DECT was 127±46 mmHg and the SAPS3 was 51±9. During their ICU stay before DECT, 41% of patients were intubated and 22% experienced an acute thrombotic event. In this selected population, the 30-day mortality was 29%. Forty-three out of sixty patients (72%) received steroids as treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia (Dexamethasone 6 mg for 10 days) [9, 10]. In order to compare the severity of the disease in No-Steroid and Steroid patients, we analyzed a wide selection of clinical and biochemical markers (see Table 2). The Steroids group showed a lower incidence of thrombotic events: 14% compared to 41% (p=0.03), a significantly lower alveolar-arterial difference of oxygen ­(AaDO2) the day of DECT compared to ICU admission (267±99 mmHg vs 322±106 mmHg, p=0.04) as well as lower inflammation (e.g., IL-6 equal to 218±155 pg/ml in the No-Steroids group vs 40±19 pg/ml in the Steroids group, p=0.01) compared to the No-Steroids group. The antithrombotic treatment (the dose of Dalteparin per kg) as well as the value of factor Xa (p=0.11) did not differ between the two groups.
DECT image analysis The HU analysis describing the gas distribution in the whole lung parenchyma showed two peaks corresponding

to the hyperinflated and to the non-inflated HU compartments (see Fig. 3 and Additional file 2: Table E1). The analysis of pulmonary blood volume distribution showed 12% of non-perfused areas in the whole lung and 11% in the hypoinflated lung (p=0.06). The HU distribution for pulmonary blood volume maps had a significantly lower kurtosis (lower homogeneity) in the hypoinflated lung compared to the whole lung parenchyma. This was true for the whole population (2.47 vs 2.99) as well as for the two analyzed subgroups: No-Steroids (1.91 vs 2.43) and Steroids group (2.69 vs 3.22) (see Figs. 3, 4, Additional file 2: Figure E1 and Tables E1-E2). Patients treated with steroids showed a smaller amount of non-inflated lung, compared to patients not exposed to steroids (10% vs 13%, p=0.01). However, steroids did not affect the volume of hyperinflated lung (26% vs 27% of total lung volume, p=0.24). Hypoinflated areas of the lung showed a significantly lower non-perfused lung parenchyma in the Steroids group compared to the No-Steroids group (13% vs 19% of total lung volume, p<0.01). Exposure to steroids was associated with an increased kurtosis (increased homogeneity) of the HU distribution of pulmonary blood volume within the lung parenchyma, regardless of the degree of inflation (2.43 vs 3.22, p<0.01 for the whole lung and 1.91 vs 2.69, p<0.01 for the hypoinflated lung). The high kurtosis (high homogeneity of pulmonary blood volume distribution) found in the Steroids groups might suggest a jeopardized HPV [27] (see Figs. 4, Additional file 2: Figure E1 and Table E2).
Lung weight analysis The analysis of total lung volume, gas volume and lung weight is reported in Tables 3, 4, 5 and Additional file 2: Figure E2. The whole population showed a mean lung weight of 966±303 g and a mean total gas volume of 1436±718 ml. The total lung volume was 2248±894 ml of which 30% was hyperinflated and 10% was noninflated. By dividing the patients based on their exposure

to steroids, significant differences were observed for lung volume and lung weight. The group of patients exposed to steroids showed a significantly lower lung weight (913 g vs 1123 g, p=0.01) as well as a significantly lower volume of non-inflated lung parenchyma compared to patients not exposed to steroids (9% vs 11% of the total lung volume, p=0.02). The total gas volume inside the lung was not affected by steroids (1425 vs 1465 ml, p=0.71) (Table 4).
Discussion To date, despite established evidence of a reduced mortality in severe COVID-19 patients treated with steroids compared to a control population [9, 10], no studies investigated the effects of steroids on the lungs in this patients' population. In the current study, for the first time, we introduced the use of dual-energy computed tomography to study the effects of steroids on lung ventilation and perfusion as well as on lung weight in patients affected by severe COVID-19 and in need of intensive care. The main findings of the current study can be summarized as follows: (1) the use of steroids is associated with a high kurtosis of lung perfusion in the hypoventilated regions of the lung. This suggests that steroids might counteract hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction; (2) steroids reduced lung weight, possibly originated by a decreased edema; (3) steroids improve regional gas distribution; (4) despite potential effects on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, gas change was improved as evidenced by a reduction in AaDO2, suggesting that the effects of steroids to reduced edema and improve gas distribution predominated.
In clinical contexts different from COVID-19, as highaltitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), steroids have been demonstrated to reduce pulmonary arterial systolic pressure, presumably counteracting hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction [12, 13]. At the same time, steroids reduce inflammation and lung edema [14]. The possible known

mechanisms of action of steroids on lungs pathophysiology are multifold. Steroid therapy is known for improving pulmonary function in preterm newborns by augmenting nitric oxide-mediated vessels relaxation as well as by

stimulating surfactant production [32]. Steroids prevent capillary leak, stimulating alveolar sodium and water reabsorption [14], and enhance nitric oxide availability in the lung parenchyma [33]. There is a still ongoing debate

about the possible benefits of their anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties on patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [34, 35]. The current study is the first investigating the possible effects of steroids on lungs in critically ill patients affected by severe COVID-19.
Interestingly, in the current study, the Steroids and the No-Steroids groups were similar to each other in all respects except for the indexes of inflammation and the onset of thromboembolic events during their ICU stay (see Table 2). Patients treated with steroids showed significantly lower inflammatory markers and, at the same time, a lower occurrence of thromboembolic events (19% vs 47%, p=0.04). The dose of antithrombotic drugs as well as the levels of factor Xa and D-dimers could not justify such differences. Although concomitant causes, potentially influencing the prothrombotic state of these patients, cannot be ruled out, the immunomodulatory

effects and antithrombotic properties of steroids [36] can be a possible explanation for these differences [37]. Although not reaching statistical significance, patients treated with steroids showed an improved oxygenation ­(PaO2/FIO2: 132 vs 123, p=0.43), a reduction in alveolar arterial difference of oxygen ­(AaDO2 326 mmHg vs 332 mmHg, p=0.9) and ameliorate static compliance (48 vs 43, p=0.49) as well as less days of mechanical ventilation and days of ICU stay. A significant reduction in A­ aDO2 followed the treatment with steroids (322±106 mmHg at admission vs 267±99 mmHg at DECT, p=0.04). The sample was underpowered to investigate a difference in mortality between the two groups.

constrict in response to alveolar hypoxemia, diverting blood from injured lung toward better ventilated lung regions. Thereby, HPV optimizes ventilation/perfusion match and improves oxygen delivery [38, 39]. A dysregulated HPV has been hypothesized in ARDS [40] and COVID-19 patients [15, 41]. The current study was neither designed to directly investigate the mechanisms of action of steroids on HPV in COVID-19 patients nor planned to grade the HPV derangement induced by COVID-19. However, our data suggest that in patients affected by severe COVID-19 the use of steroids might jeopardize HPV (see Figs. 4, 5 and Additional file 2: Table E2). A damped HPV is apparently not in line with the known beneficial effects of steroids observed in severe COVID-19 patients [9, 42]. However, this

can mitigate the risk for right ventricular failure, one of the major determinants of poor clinical outcomes in ARDS [43, 44]. Moreover, other concomitant beneficial mechanisms induced by steroids as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, as well as the reduction in lung edema, demonstrated in this study, might also compensate for a worsened HPV and an exacerbated ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Although HPV is the primary active mechanism influencing regional lung perfusion, other concomitant factors can have a role. Among others, superinfections by Gram-negative bacteria, potentially less hindered in patients treated with steroids, could possibly attenuate HPV [45]. At the same time, direct mechanical effects as well as undefined intracellular signaling can be listed among nonhypoxia-related mechanisms affecting regional lung perfusion [46, 47].

On the right: Patient treated with steroids (Steroids group). For both No-Steroids and Steroids group, upper images show a pulmonary gas volume image (left) and the corresponding map (right); lower images show a pulmonary blood volume image (left) and the corresponding map (right). Different colormaps have been used to emphasize different degree of pulmonary gas and blood volume. For pulmonary gas volume maps, the range of HU is between - 1000 and+100 HU. For pulmonary blood volume maps, the range of HU is between 0 and+100 HU. 0 HU corresponding to non-perfused areas, 100 HU corresponding to highly perfused areas. The red arrow indicates the areas of preserved hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction where the areas of low pulmonary blood volume correspond to the areas of low inflation

Effects of steroids on lung edema At the pulmonary level, steroids prevent inflammatory capillary leak and edema, stimulating alveolar sodium and water reabsorption [14]. We demonstrated a reduced lung weight as well as lower volume of non-inflated lung in patients treated with steroids compared to control (see Table 3, 5 and Additional file 2: Figure E2).
Although not affecting global gas volume (see Tables 3, 5), steroids improved the homogeneity of gas distribution within the lung parenchyma (see Fig. 4 and Additional file 2: Table E2). The exposure to steroids reduced the non-inflated, atelectatic lung compartment. This is reflected in a significantly reduced ­AaDO2 following treatment with steroids (322±106 mmHg at admission vs 267±99 mmHg at DECT, p=0.04). These findings can also be interpreted as a consequence of a reduced lung edema and inflammation following treatment with steroids. Thus, although there was evidence for reduced HPV the beneficial effects of steroids acting to reduce edema and improve gas distribution on gas exchange predominated.
Alongside emerging understanding of the pulmonary vascular involvement in COVID-19 patients, the key mechanism of the most immediately dangerous

consequence of COVID-19 (hypoxemia) has been ascribed to the concurrent disruption of the tri-compartmental model of lung oxygenation [48]. Consequently, research has progressively focused upon the ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Mauri et al. [49], in a small cohort of COVID-19 patients studied using electrical impedance tomography, reported that ventilation/perfusion mismatch was elevated and mainly due to non-perfused but ventilated units. Later, using a computational model, Busana et al. [50] attributed hypoxemia of COVID-19 to a marked hyperperfusion of poorly ventilated lung regions.
Given its availability in clinical practice, chest contrastenhanced DECT is emerging as a promising tool for studying lung physiology [16, 17]. The strength of DECT is that it simultaneously provides information about both gas and blood distribution and, consequently, has great potential in describing ventilation/perfusion dysregulation in COVID-19 [41]. Recently, Ball et al. [20] performed the first quantitative study regarding the distribution of gas volume and blood in the lungs of patients affected by COVID-19 by using DECT, reporting several deviations from normal physiology, among which the blood volume distribution in non-aerated tissue mass.

This is the first study based on chest DECT investigating the functional effects of steroids on lungs in patients affected by severe COVID-19. Compared to the previous literature, the current study took a step forward, not only investigating the regional distribution of pulmonary gas volume and blood volume in COVID-19, but also characterizing the effects that steroids have on them. Our results suggested that a deranged HPV or a reduced lung edema might modify the ventilation/perfusion mismatch characterizing COVID-19 lungs.
Limitations of the study can be listed as follows. Being an observational study, the analysis is based on DECT performed on the basis of a clinical indication and this might imply a selection bias. However, all COVID-19 patients admitted to our ICU, with very few exceptions, underwent either computed tomography with contrast or DECT. All were performed in supine position. As

reported in Table 2, the time between the symptoms start and DECT was not different between the two groups (16±8 days for the No-Steroids group vs 13±6 days for the Steroids group, p=0.45). Moreover, in the Steroids group, the DECT examinations included in the study were all performed within 4±3 days from the start of the steroid treatment (see Table 2). With few exceptions with clear contraindications, pronation was routinely applied for all patients, already before ICU stay. Therefore, the exact time spent in pronation by each patient cannot be reliably quantified. The execution of the DECT was performed not before one hour from the end of the eventual preceding pronation phase due to the necessity of observing whether the patient was sufficiently stable for the transport to the CT facility. All patients in the No-Steroids group were admitted before June 16, 2020; after that date, the COVID-19 patients admitted

to the ICU were treated with steroids (Steroids group) as a consequence of a change of treatment guidelines. The fact that steroids have been introduced at a specific time of the pandemic might introduce a chronology bias into the study. As a matter of fact, the SARS-CoV2 pandemic during its course has been characterized by a continuous change of treatment strategies and clinical routines that affect the generalizability of many studies on COVID-19. However, in our study, all the recruited patients were not vaccinated for SARS-CoV2, they were all affected by the same SARS-CoV2 variant (the original Wuhan variant) and, in the studied time lapse, there were not concomitant antiviral/anti-inflammatory treatments specific to COVID-19 other than steroids. Given the demonstrated positive effects of steroids and their routine use in severe COVID-19 patients [9], a prospective study comparing patients exposed or not exposed to steroids would have entailed unsolvable ethical issues. Given the design of the study, the direct causality between steroids and a deranged HPV could not be directly investigated. We did not directly study how steroids influence the pathophysiological mechanisms of HPV. Moreover, a deranged HPV is not the only factor interfering with the regional distribution of perfused blood volume, e.g., pulmonary thrombotic events, lung heterogeneity or interstitial edema are concomitant causes also affecting blood distribution and shunt. However, of all factors potentially aggravating shunt, HPV is the only one influencing, in a targeted manner, hypo-/non-inflated lung regions. The DECT scanner does not reach the resolution necessary to observe the behavior of single capillaries. For this reason, the attenuation value of one voxel portrayed the behavior of many alveoli and of the complex mesh of capillary vessels surrounding them. In this respect, the choice of focusing the analysis to the subpopulation of voxels subtending hypo- or non-inflated areas reduces the possible error deriving from the mechanical interaction between the inflated alveoli and the neighboring capillary units, being them in a similar inflation status. Although intriguing and supported by indirect evidences (i.e., lung imaging), the hypothesized parallelism between the mechanisms of action of steroids in HAPE and COVID19 needs further investigations [51]. Steroids have pleiotropic effects [11] and the current study investigated only some possible consequences of pharmacodynamic mechanisms characterizing steroids. Chest DECT provides static information about gas volume at one predefined moment. Pulmonary gas volume maps are widely used in the literature to infer ventilation distribution [19]. The same applies to DECT pulmonary blood volume maps [52]. DECT generates images describing blood volume distribution within the lung at one single time point: For this reason, these images should only be indirectly and

cautiously used to infer lung perfusion. Despite its limitations, the present study is the first one shedding light on the effects of steroids on the regional distribution of pulmonary gas volume and blood volume in COVID-19 patients.
Conclusions Chest DECT can provide unique functional information and visualize the effects of pharmacodynamic mechanisms of drugs on lung parenchyma. Taking advantage of chest DECT, we show changes in pulmonary gas volume and blood volume that might stand for an association between the use of steroids and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in severe COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care. Steroids can influence ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Moreover, treatment with steroids is associated with a reduced lung edema and consequently improves regional distribution of gas volume within the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients.

In this paper, a mathematical model based on a system of ordinary di erential equations is developed with vaccination as an intervention for the transmission dynamics of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). e model solutions are shown to be well posed.
e vaccine reproduction number is computed by using the next-generation matrix approach. e sensitivity analysis carried out on this model showed that the vaccination rate and vaccine e cacy are among the most sensitive parameters of the vaccine reproduction number, RV. e optimal control problem is solved with the rate of vaccination and the transition rate from the vaccinated class to the infected class as control variables. Finally, the numerical simulations showed that the control intervention should aim to increase the vaccination rate with a high-e cacy vaccine.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). e increasing prevalence rate of the virus nearly devastated healthcare systems across the world [1, 2]. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease a global health pandemic. It is transmitted through inhalation of respiratory droplets from an infectious person emitted through sneezing, coughing, and having a close conversation, as well as contact with contaminated surfaces [3]. e infection prominently a ects the respiratory tract. e initial COVID-19 symptoms are fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Other symptoms include body aches and pains, a sore throat, diarrhoea, headache, loss of taste and smell, breathing di culties, skin rash, and discoloration of the
ngers and toes [3]. COVID-19 morbidity and mortality can be compounded
by pre-existing diseases such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cancer, infectious diseases, and substance abuse. Furthermore, pre-existing conditions such as environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic factors may in uence the COVID-19 incidence rate [4]. To prevent and

control the spread of COVID-19, health providers and governments around the world implemented containment measures such as lockdowns, travel bans, cessation of movement, social distancing, proper hygiene, and proper hand washing, among others. Despite these safeguards, the virus continues to spread, although at a slow rate.
Vaccination has been a major public health tool in modern medicine used to minimize the impact of many infectious diseases on humans [5, 6]. A vaccine is any biologically derived substance that elicits a protective immune response when administered to a susceptible host. Vaccines help the body to prepare for disease by taking the advantage of the fact that immunity knows how to defend against infectious organisms, which are typically viruses, bacteria, or toxins [7]. Given the emergence of highly transmissible new variants, decreased vaccine e ectiveness, and unequal vaccine availability, there is a growing concern that vaccination may not result in herd immunity. Vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease and death; therefore, a country's vaccine coverage must be high in order to protect the healthcare system from an infection surge [2]. Since late 2020, several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that are more transmissible and/or vaccine-resistant have been identi ed [8].

In modern medicine, vaccination has been an important public health technique for reducing the burden of many human infectious diseases [5, 6, 9]. Several COVID-19 vaccine candidates have been developed and are already in use [10]. Vaccines such as Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Sinopharm, Johnson & Johnson, and many others are currently being administered around the world to date. It is a social responsibility choice of an individual to get vaccinated. However, offsetting the fear and adverse side effects of the vaccine has to be carried out[11]. e shortage of supply of COVID-19 vaccines in many developing countries has resulted in the implementation of different immunization strategies, with varying results. For example, in Kenya, prioritization is given to the adult population [2].
A mathematical model provides insight into infectious disease transmission and control [12, 13]. Many mathematical models on the dynamics of COVID-19 with control strategies have been developed and studied, for example, in studies carried out in [9, 10]. Optimal control is regarded as a powerful mathematical tool for optimizing control problems in various fields [14-18]. In the context of vaccination, the dynamics of disease transmission and immunity in a population are typically modelled by using network compartmental approaches [19]. A mathematical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 is presented in [18]. An optimal control function is added to the model in order to effectively control the outbreak. e main controls are isolation, quarantine, and hospitalization. e result shows that adopting the available control measures to their full potential will greatly reduce infectious populations.
A new COVID-19 model with an optimal control analysis is presented in [20]. e authors considered four different controls to develop an optimal control model, including prevention, vaccination control, rapid screening of people who are exposed, and people who are infected without screening. e forward-backward Runge-Kutta method is used to resolve the model with and without control. e findings suggest that control can be useful for reducing infected individuals and improving population health. A novel fractional-order mathematical model that explains the behaviour of COVID-19 in Ethiopia is developed and analyzed in [21]. An inexact Newton iterative method is used to solve the model system. e model considers the impact of various control techniques on disease transmission.
Zamir et al. in [22] developed a mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. e study used a nonclinical approach to investigate optimal control. A COVID-19 mathematical model that takes into account the susceptible, exposed, infected, asymptotic, quarantine/isolation, and recovered classes is developed and analyzed in [23]. Elasticity and sensitivity analysis shows that the model is more sensitive to transmission rates from infected to exposed classes than transmission rates from susceptible to exposed classes.
Alqarni et al. [24] developed a new mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of the coronavirus (COVID19) using cases reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from March 2, 2020, to July 31, 2020. e model's stability

results are shown when the basic reproduction number is R0 < 1, and the model is locally asymptotically stable. Using the PRCC method, they show some important parameters that are more sensitive to the basic reproduction number R0.
e sensitive parameters that act as control parameters and can reduce and control infection in the population are depicted graphically. e study results suggested that if controls are followed, the infection rate in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia can be reduced significantly. In this study, an extended SEIR COVID-19 dynamics model with vaccination is proposed to investigate the impact of vaccination as a control intervention on the pandemic spread.

2. Model Formulation

A

susceptible-vaccinated-exposed-infected-recovered

(SVEIR) model with a standard incidence rate is developed

and analyzed. Despite the fact that there are underlying

conditions that predispose someone to a higher risk of

contracting COVID-19 disease, the population under study

is assumed to have an equal level of susceptibility. Indi-

viduals in this category are known as susceptible individuals

denoted by S(t). Several COVID-19 vaccine candidates have

been developed and are already in use [10]. Individuals who

have been vaccinated are hereby categorised as the vacci-

nated class, denoted by V(t). When susceptible individuals

are exposed to the virus, they undergo an incubation period,

which is the time between virus exposure and the onset of

symptoms. is is on average 5-6 days, but it can be as long

as 14 days [25]. e incubating individuals in this study are

categorised as the exposed class denoted by E(t). Following

the end of the exposure period, the incubating individual's

transit into the infection class is denoted by I(t). e in-

fectious potential of COVID-19 is significantly greater just

before or within the first five days of symptom onset [26].

e infected class I(t), in this study, includes both pre-

symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Depending on the

severity of symptoms and the intervention strategies in

place, the infected individuals may die or recover from the

disease. us, the class R(t) denotes the number of indi-

viduals who have recovered from the infection. e study

assumes that infection with COVID-19 confers temporary

immunity upon recovery.

e recruitment of individuals into the susceptible class

is through births at the per capita rate . Following an

outbreak of the disease, several containment measures are

implemented to control the spread. e susceptible humans

acquire infection from an infectious individual via a force of

infection I, where  is the transmission coefficient. e

saturated incidence rates given by SI/1 + I and

1VI/1 + I tend to the saturation level when I grows large.

e constant  measures the saturation effects caused by

infective individuals in the presence of containment mea-

sures. e proportion of vaccination is given by c,

(0 < c  1). e transmission coefficient of the vaccinees is

denoted by 1:  (1 - ), where the parameter ,

(0 <   1) measures the vaccine efficacy. e vaccinees are

considered to have acquired partial immunity against

COVID-19 subject to the type of vaccine (efficacy level)

administered to an individual. e transmission coe cient of the vaccinees, 1 <  since the vaccinees are assumed to have acquired a vaccine-induced immunity [27, 28]. e rate at which exposed individuals become infectious is denoted by . e rates of natural and disease-induced mortality are  and , respectively. e recovery rate from the infection is taken as .

3. Well-Posedness of the Model

In this section, well-posedness of the model solutions is discussed. Model (1) describes the human population, and therefore, its solutions, as shown below, are positive and bounded for all time t  0.

3.1. Boundedness of Solutions. Model (1) is analyzed in a suitable feasible region

where S(t) + V(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) N(t) gives the total human population.
Using Proposition 1 below, the model solutions are shown to be bounded for all t  0 in the region .

Proposition 1. For all time t  0, the solutions of model (1) are invariant in the region .

Proof. e solutions of model (1) are positively invariant of , i.e., all solutions start in  and remain in the region  for all t  0. e rate of change of human population N(t) is given by

dN dS + dV + dE + dI + dR.

Hence, all solutions of model (1) are bounded in the

region .



3.2. Positivity of Solutions

Proposition 2. All solution sets {S(t), V(t), E(t), I(t), R(t)} of model (1) with non-negative initial conditions are positive t > 0.
Proof. Considering the rst equation in model (1), that is,

(11)

In a similar way, all the other variables can be shown to

be positive t  0. Hence, all solutions of model (1) are

positive in the region .

Clearly, from Propositions 1 and 2, all solutions of model

(1) are shown to be positively invariant in the region . us,

model (1) is mathematically and epidemiologically well

posed in a biological feasible region .



4. The Vaccine Reproduction Number and the Disease-Free Equilibrium
In this section, the disease-free equilibrium and the vaccine reproduction number RV of the model (1) are computed.

4.1. e Disease-Free Equilibrium. e disease-free equilibrium (DFE) point of model (1) is defined as the state in which there is no COVID-19 infection in the population under study.
Proposition 3. ere exists a DFE of model (1) given by E0  S0, V0, E0, I0, R0   + c, (c+ c), 0, 0, 0. (12)
Proof. At the disease-free equilibrium point, there is no infection in the population. erefore, with E  I  R  0, then model (1) is given as follows:
 - SI - ( + c)S  0, 1 + I
cS - 1VI - V  0, 1 + I
S + 1VI - ( + )E  0, (13) 1 + I
E - ( +  + )I  0,
I - R  0.

4.2. Reproduction Number. e basic reproduction number, usually denoted by R0, is defined as the average number of secondary infections due to a single infectious individual introduced into a fully susceptible population during his/her period of infectivity [29]. e basic reproduction number is the spectral radius of the matrix, FV- 1, R0  (FV- 1), where F and V are the next-generation matrices [30]. e operator FV- 1, the next generation matrix, is formed from matrices of partial derivatives of Fi (the rate of appearance of new infection in the ith compartment) and Vi  V-i - V+i (the rate of transfer/transition rate in and out of the disease compartment i) with respect to the infected compartments (E and I) evaluated at DFE. e matrices F and V are given by

e vaccine reproduction number, RV, is the measure of

the severity of an epidemic in the presence of vaccination

and one of the most important parameters since it deter-

mines whether or not the disease will invade a population.

Epidemiologically, if RV < 1, then by definition, the infection

does not spread in the population. On the other hand, if

RV > 1, then the infection spreads in the population and may

result into an epidemic.

5. Sensitivity Analysis

e degree to which an input parameter influences a model's output is known as parameter sensitivity. Sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number can be used to develop a mitigation strategy that will slow the spread of the pandemic by lowering RV [14]. Sensitive parameters are those that have a significant impact on the transmission dynamics of an infection. Using the normalized forward sensitivity indices [31], the sensitivity indices are computed by

where M is the parameter whose sensitivity index is computed.
Table 1 gives a summary of the sensitivity indices of RV evaluated at the baseline parameters values given in Table 2.
From the sensitivity analysis as presented in Table 1, an increase of the rate of vaccination c by 1% leads to a decrease of the effective reproduction RV by 0.89844626%. An increase of the vaccine efficacy  by 1% leads to a decrease in the effective reproductive number RV by 0.9990436%. Clearly, the rate of vaccination and the vaccine efficacy are among the sensitive parameters of RV. An increase in the rate of vaccination, with high vaccine efficacy, leads to a decrease in the vaccine reproduction number. Consequently, control strategies should target an increased rate of vaccination and administration of vaccines of high efficacy levels.

To determine the optimum vaccination program for COVID-19, let the variables c and 1  : (1 - ) be the control variables.

7. Numerical Simulation and Discussion
e parameters used for simulation are obtained from literature, and others are estimates, as listed in Table 2. ese parameter values are varied within realistic limits.
For purposes of simulation, unless otherwise stated, the initial populations are taken to be S(0)  3000, V(0)  2000, E(0)  1500, I(0)  1200, and R(0)  1000.
e numerical simulation aims to analyze the change in the state of COVID-19 virus progression over time, as well as the impact of variation in the vaccination rate and vaccine efficacy on COVID-19 transmission dynamics. is is accomplished by varying the parameters  and c while holding the other parameters constant. Simulation analyses of the model (1) are presented in Figures 2 and 3.
Figure 2 shows the effect of variation in vaccine efficacy () on infection dynamics. When the vaccine administered is of high efficacy, say 90% efficacy, it would take less time for the pool of infected individuals to reduce. On the other hand, when the vaccine efficacy is low, it would take a longer time for the number of infected individuals to reduce, and therefore, COVID-19 infection would persist in the population. Figure 3 shows the effect of variation in the vaccination rate (c) on infection dynamics. It is shown that when the rate of vaccination is high, the number of infected individuals decreases sharply and vice versa. Figure 4 shows the graph of the vaccine reproduction number RV against the vaccination rate (c). It is observed that with an increase in the rate of vaccination (c), the vaccine reproduction number decreases sharply. Figure 5 shows the 3D plot of the vaccine reproduction number RV against the rate of vaccination (c)

Vaccination offers a very powerful method of COVID-19 disease control. e critical level of vaccination of above 50% with an > 80% vaccine efficacy level would be required to reduce the severity and eventually eradicate the infection from the population. Herd immunity against COVID-19 can be achieved by immunizing a significant proportion of the

susceptible population. To prevent a large outbreak in the future, in addition to vaccination, a variety of other control measures (e.g., COVID-19 protocols such as the use of masks, social distancing, proper hygiene, and so on) are required [14, 36].
8. Conclusion
In this paper, the effect of vaccination as an intervention is investigated through an SVEIR model. e well-posedness of the model and the existence of disease-free equilibrium are shown. Sensitivity analysis here suggests that the rate of vaccination, c, and the vaccine efficacy  are among the most influential parameters of RV. For optimal control, increasing the vaccination rate and administering highly efficacious vaccines would help maximize control strategies against COVID-19 transmission dynamics. is is illustrated by the numerical simulations. is study, like others [19, 37, 38], confirms that vaccination may possibly eradicate the infection in the population. Future research could focus on an age-dependent SVEIR model to determine the suitable vaccination strategy to be applied with respect to age.

Abstract-- Masks are used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to limit transmission and save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research about the impact of maskwearing in the COVID-19 pandemic has raised formidable interest across multiple disciplines. In this paper, we investigate the impact of mask-wearing in spreading processes over complex networks. This is done by studying a heterogeneous bond percolation process over a multi-type network model, where nodes can be one of two types (mask-wearing, and not-maskwearing). We provide analytical results that accurately predict the expected epidemic size and probability of emergence as functions of the characteristics of the spreading process (e.g., transmission probabilities, inward and outward efficiency of the masks, etc.), the proportion of mask-wearers in the population, and the structure of the underlying contact network. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we also conduct extensive simulations on random networks. We also comment on the analogy between the mask-model studied here and the multiple-strain viral spreading model with mutations studied recently by Eletreby et al.
I. INTRODUCTION
The rapid spread of COVID-19 has devastated the world since its inception in December 2019, leading to global economic crises and claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. As schools and businesses reopen, it is of paramount importance to asses how various safety measures may limit the spread of COVID-19. One such measure is mask-wearing, which is known to reduce the transmissibility of viruses that spread through respiratory droplets. Much of the existing work surrounding the effectiveness of mask-wearing have studied how it limits transmission between individuals [11], [9]. However, several questions remain regarding the health of the general public. How many people must wear masks to significantly curb the spread of COVID-19? More generally, how does mask-wearing change the spreading dynamics of an epidemic?
In this paper, we provide quantitative answers to the questions above. To do so, we consider a natural generalization of the commonly-used Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model on networks in which some individuals wear masks while others do not. We allow for different probabilities of transmission between mask-wearers and non-mask-wearers, so that an individual wearing a mask is less likely to be infected. We refer to this model as the mask model. For networks with a given degree distribution, we provide
1yurunt@andrew.cmu.edu, 2anirudhs@princeton.edu 3oyagan@andrew.cmu.edu, 4poor@princeton.edu

analytical methods to accurately predict the total number of infected individuals of each type (mask-wearing and nonmask-wearing) as well as the probability that an epidemic will emerge. Technically, this is achieved by adapting techniques developed by Alexander and Day [2] as well as Eletreby, Zhuang, Carley, Yagan and Poor [8], which were used to study a multi-strain model with mutation. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to illustrate how mask-wearing can impact the spread of an epidemic.
A. Related Work
Classical models of epidemics use a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the fraction of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals within the population (see for instance [5]). Prior models which incorporate the effects of mask-wearing have modified the basic ODE model in various ways. Brienen et al [6] considered a simple modification in which the reproductive number of the virus, R0, is reduced by a multiplicative factor based on the efficacy of masks. Subsequently, Tracht et al [17] as well as Eikenberry et al [7] considered more complex generalizations of the basic ODE model in which mask-wearers and nonmask-wearers have different transmissibilities and maskwearers become non-mask-wearers at some rate, as well as vice versa. While ODE-based models are relatively simple to simulate and analyze, they are only mathematically justified under the unrealistic assumption that an infected individual can transmit the virus to any other susceptible individual in the population, regardless of location or other factors.
Our approach, on the other hand, falls under the class of network epidemic models. These models take an individuallevel view of viral spread, and studies how the structure of the contact network influences the epidemic. This provides much finer information about the epidemic, but is costly to simulate, spurring a large body of work devoted to deriving analytical predictions of epidemiological properties [15], [14], [12]. In particular, our work is closely related to literature on heterogenous bond percolation [3], [10] and a multiple-strain model with mutations [2], [8]. We elaborate on these connections in later sections.
II. EPIDEMIC MODELS
The most basic model of network epidemics was studied by Newman [15]; we briefly review his setup in order to provide context for the more complex models we consider

in this paper. Given a prescribed degree distribution (for instance Poisson or Power law), a random contact network is generated via the configuration model [13], [4], [16]. Initially, a single individual (patient zero) is infected with the virus, and each neighbor of patient zero becomes infected with probability T , where T is referred to as the transmissibility of the virus. Patient zero then recovers and is no longer susceptible. The process continues as each newlyinfected vertex attempts to infect their susceptible neighbors in the same manner. The process terminates when there are no more susceptible vertices in the population.
A. Single-strain propagation with masks
To account for the effects of mask-wearing on viral spread, we make the following modifications to Newman's model. First, we specify m  [0, 1] to be the expected fraction of individuals who wear a mask. Formally, we assign each vertex in the contact network a mask with probability m and no mask with probability 1 - m. This is done independently for each vertex. Second, we assume that the transmissibilities are heterogenous: the probability that individual u infects individual v depends on whether u and v are wearing masks. We say that a vertex is of type 1 if they wear a mask and type 2 if they do not wear a mask. We then have four parameters describing the transmissibility of the virus: T11, T12, T21 and T22. The parameter T11 is the transmissibility when u and v both wear masks, T12 is the transmissibility when u wears a mask and v does not, etc. For brevity, we refer to this model as the Mask Model. This type of model is sometimes called heterogenous bond percolation over multi-type networks. We remark that while Allard et al [3] consider such a model in full generality, an important contribution of this paper is to study in detail the important case of mask-wearing. After the initial submission of our paper in September 2020, Lee and Zhu [10] studied the same Mask Model we propose here and derived the epidemic threshold and expected epidemic size using similar techniques as Allard et al. Here, using different techniques we additionally characterize the probability of emergence and provide extensive simulations to support our results.
B. Multi-strain Model with Mutation
In [2], Alexander and Day proposed a multiple-strain model that accounts for mutations between strains. In their model, there are d possible strains of a virus with transmissibilities given by Q1, . . . , Qd. If an individual is infected with strain i, the virus may mutate into a different strain within the host. Formally, the probability that strain i mutates into strain j within a host is given by µij.
We next describe a mapping between the Mask Model and the multi-strain model with mutation. The key insight is that in expectation, a mask-wearing individual will have a different effective transmissibility than a non-mask-wearing individual. This will allow us to map the mask-wearing model into a two-strain model with mutation.
We begin by deriving the transmissibilities of the twostrain model. Suppose that a vertex v is infected and wears

a mask. Since each neighbor wears a mask with probability m, the expected transmissibility of v is given by

Q1 := T11 · m + T12 · (1 - m).

(1)

Similarly, if v does not wear a mask, the transmissibility is

given by

Q2 := T21 · m + T22 · (1 - m).

(2)

Proceeding with the analogy, the mutation probability µ11 is the fraction of mask-wearing neighbors infected by a maskwearer. This is given by
µ11 := T11 · m . (3) T11 · m + T12 · (1 - m)
Using the same reasoning, we can compute the other three mutation probabilities as
µ12 = T12 · (1 - m) (4) T11 · m + T12 · (1 - m)
µ21 = T21 · m (5) T21 · m + T22 · (1 - m)
µ22 = T22 · (1 - m) . (6) T21 · m + T22 · (1 - m)
The advantage of this formulation is that it allows us to compute analytical predictions for the probability of emergence and epidemic size in the Mask Model using the methods of Eletreby et al [8], which hold for the multi-strain model with mutation.

III. ANALYSIS
In this section, we derive analytical predictions for the probability of emergence and the expected epidemic size. One way to do so is by formulating the mask model as a multi-strain model with mutation and then leverage the analytical predictions of Eletreby et al [8]. We also compute the probability of emergence and epidemic size directly for the mask model, using methods developed by Alexander and Day [2] as well as Eletreby et al [8].

A. Probability of emergence
Emergence refers to the event where the epidemic process persists over time and keeps infecting susceptible individuals. Extinction, on the other hand, is the event where the epidemic dies out in finite time. In this section, we show how to compute P1 (resp. P2) which is the probability of extinction given that patient zero wears a mask (resp. does not wear a mask). The probability of emergence can then be computed as 1 - P1 if patient zero wears a mask and 1 - P2 otherwise.
Our analysis follows the method of Alexander and Day [2], who derived expressions for the probability of emergence in the multi-strain model with mutation. Suppose that a randomly chosen vertex v is patient zero and assume that v wears a mask. Let X (resp. Y ) be the number of mask-wearing (resp., non-mask-wearing) neighbors of v who are infected by v. Then, conditioned on v having k1 susceptible mask-wearing neighbors and k2 susceptible nonmask-wearing neighbors, X and Y are independent with

X  Binomial(k1, T11) and Y  Binomial(k2, T12). Thus for s, t  R,

E[sX tY | k1, k2] = (1 - T11 + s · T11)k1 (1 - T12 + t · T12)k2 .

Next, if k is the total number of susceptible neighbors, we have k1  Binomial(k, m) and k2 = k - k1. Hence

k
E[sX tY | k] =

k (m(1 - T11 + sT11))k1

k1=0 k1

× ((1 - m)(1 - T12 + tT12))k-k1

= (1 - (mT11 + (1 - m)T12) + (msT11 + (1 - m)tT12))k .

Using the analogy with the multi-strain model with mutation (see (1)-(6)) we can equivalently write
E[sX tY | k] = (1 - Q1 + Q1(sµ11 + tµ12))k. (7)

We remark that (7) also holds in the multi-strain model with mutation [2, Section 2.2], implying the probability of emergence is identical in both models. For completeness, we describe how to compute this probability.
Define 1(s, t) to be the probability generating function (PGF) for the number of infections of each type (maskwearing or not) emanating from patient zero. We have

1(s, t) = g(1 - Q1 + Q1(sµ11 + tµ12)),

where g is the PGF of the degree distribution, i.e., g(z) =

 k=0

pk z k .

Following

the

same

arguments,

we

have

2(s, t) = g(1 - Q2 + Q2(sµ21 + tµ22)).

The PGF of the number of infections of each type emanating from a later-generation infective wearing a mask, given by 1(s, t), is

1(s, t) = G(1 - Q1 + Q1(sµ11 + tµ12)),

where G is the PGF for the excess degree distribution, i.e., G(z) =  k=0 kkpk zk. We also have
2(s, t) = G(1 - Q2 + Q2(sµ21 + tµ22)).

With the derived PGFs in hand, the probability of extinction starting from a later-generation infective, given by q1 (resp., q2) if patient zero wears a mask (resp., does not wear a mask), is the smallest non-negative solution of the fixed-point equation (s, t) = (1(s, t), 2(s, t)). Finally, the probability of emergence starting from patient zero, denoted by P1 (resp., P2) if patient zero wears a mask (resp., does not wear a mask) is given by (P1, P2) = (1(q1, q2), 2(q1, q2)).
Since the probability of emergence is the same in the Mask model and the multi-strain model with mutation, the critical threshold at which an epidemic emerges (also known as the reproductive number R0) is the same in both models as well. To calculate this threshold, we first introduce two matrices:

Q := Q1 0 0 Q2

and µ := µ11 µ12 . µ21 µ22

Then the formula for the critical threshold [8], [2] is

R0 :=

k2 - k k

(Qµ),

where (Qµ) denotes the spectral radius of Qµ and k , k2 are the first and second moments of the degree distribution, respectively. If R0 < 1 the epidemic dies out in finite time, and if R0 > 1 an epidemic persists. To write things in terms of the parameters of the Mask model, we can
define the matrices

T := T11 T12 T21 T22

m0 and m := 0 1 - m ,

and note that Qµ = Tm. Hence we equivalently have

R0 =

k2 - k k

(Tm).

B. Expected epidemic Size

We follow the method of Eletreby et al [8]. Since the contact network G is drawn from the configuration model with degree distribution {pk}k, it is locally tree-like. We can compute the probability that a given vertex is infected
by considering the tree-like neighborhood around it. Math-
ematically, we can consider an infinite rooted tree where
the bottom level is labeled level zero and the top (the root) is labeled level infinity. We let q ,1 (respectively, q ,2) be the probability that a mask-wearing (respectively, non-mask-
wearing) vertex is infected in level . The pair (q +1,1, q +1,2) can be recursively computed from
(q ,1, q ,2) as follows. Consider a vertex in level + 1 that wears a mask. It has degree k with probability kkpk due to properties of the configuration model. Due to the tree structure, k - 1 of these edges are sent to and one is sent to the parent in level + 2. Out of the k - 1 levelneighbors, some number X wear a mask while the rest do not, where X  Binomial(k - 1, m). Out of the X maskwearing neighbors, some number U are infected, where U  Binomial(X, q ,1). Similarly, there are V infected non-maskwearing neighbors, where V  Binomial(k - 1 - X, q ,2). Finally, if there are U infected mask-wearing neighbors and V infected non-mask-wearing neighbors, the probability that the mask-wearing parent in level + 1 becomes infected is 1 - (1 - T11)U (1 - T21)V . If we define

z
f1(z, q1, q2) :=

z mx(1 - m)z-x

x

x=0

x
×

x q1u(1 - q1)x-u

u=0

z-x
×
v=0

z -v x q2v(1 - q2)z-x-v

× (1 - (1 - T11)u(1 - T21)v), (8)

then we have

 kpk

q +1,1 =

k f1(k - 1, q ,1, q ,2).

k=0

If we define f2 to be the same as (8) except the term (1 - (T - T11)u(1 - T21)v)

is replaced by

(1 - (1 - T12)u(1 - T22)v),

then we also have

 kpk

q +1,2 =

k f2(k - 1, q ,1, q ,2).

k=0

Following the analysis in [8], the sequence {q ,1, q ,2} 1 converges to a limit (q,1, q,2) which satisfies the fixed point equation

 kpk

q,i =

k fi(k - 1, q,1, q,2),

k=0

i  {1, 2}.

Finally, to compute the probability of infection at the root, we note that the root has k neighbors with probability pk, and all neighbors are in a lower level. Thus, if S1 (S2) is the probability of infection of a mask-wearing (non-maskwearing) root vertex, then we have


Si = pkfi(k, q,1, q,2),
k=0

i  {1, 2}.

As our analysis was for an arbitrarily chosen root node, Si is the expected fraction of mask-wearing vertices that eventually get infected by the epidemic, conditioned on the epidemic occurring. The total fraction of infections is then given by S = S1 · m + S2 · (1 - m).

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS A. Epidemic as a function of the mean degree

degree ranging between 0 and 10. To generate the simulation plots, we took an average over 20,000 independent trials where, in each trial, a new contact network was generated. The parameters of the mask model were chosen to be m = 0.45, T11 = 0.126, T12 = 0.18, T21 = 0.42, T22 = 0.6. The choice of m was based on the current fraction of maskwearers in the US [1]. The transmissibility parameters were chosen as a reasonable baseline to illustrate the model and our theoretical results about the model. For larger mean degrees, we see that we have a near-perfect match between the simulations and theoretical predictions. For smaller mean degrees, the match is close, but not perfect, since the emergence event becomes quite rare close to the phase transition point. We expect that if much larger networks are used, the simulations will enjoy better alignment with the theoretical predictions, even close to the phase transition point.

Fig. 1. Plot of the probability of emergence from simulations and theoretical predictions. The degree distribution is Poisson with varying mean.
We conducted extensive numerical simulations to validate our theoretical analysis. In Figure 1, we study the probability of emergence. The contact network was generated via the configuration model with Poisson degree distribution and 500,000 vertices. We studied several values for the mean

In Figure 2, we study the expected size of the epidemic, conditioned on emergence. In our simulations, we used the same number of nodes and degree distribution, averaged over 10,000 independent trials. The same parameters for the mask model were used as well. We see very good alignment between the simulations and theoretical predictions, confirming the validity of our theoretical results.
In Figure 3, we illustrate the interesting finding that while the multi-strain model with mutations can be used to compute the probability of emergence in the Mask model, it yields an incorrect prediction of the expected epidemic size. There seems to be a good alignment between the two curves close to the critical threshold, but the two predictions diverge for larger mean degrees. We give a possible reason for this mismatch. In the mask model, there is a single strain in the population and a susceptible vertex is infected as long as as there is a successful infection by at least one neighbor. In the multi-strain model with mutation, if there are multiple successful infections to a susceptible vertex, the resulting transmitted strain depends on the number of successful infections of each type. When the mean degree

There is good alignment close to the critical threshold, but the predictions diverge for larger mean degrees. We use the same parameters as in Figure 2.
is small, it is unlikely that there will be more than one successful infection, as the number of neighbors of a vertex is small. However as the mean degree increases, the difference becomes more pronounced. We plan to further investigate the fundamental differences between the mask model and multi-strain model with mutations in future work.
B. Epidemic as a function of the fraction of mask-wearers

demonstrating the effectiveness of masks in curbing the spread of COVID-19. Interestingly, we see that the fraction of infected non-mask-wearers (shown in blue) is also monotonically decreasing in m. The intuition for this observation is clear; if many individuals wear a mask, on a high level it reduces the effective transmissibility of the virus, thus reducing the number of infected non-mask-wearers as well. Curiously, the fraction of infected mask-wearers is not monotonically decreasing in m; the infection curve peaks at m = 0.6. We provide a possible explanation. There are two opposing effects which influence the number of infected mask-wearers. As m increases, the total number of infected mask-wearers will naturally increase, since there are more susceptible mask-wearers in the population. On the other hand, increasing m will also decrease the transmissibility of the virus, leading to a lower rate of infection. When m < 0.6, the first effect dominates: the increase in susceptible maskwearers is greater than the decrease in transmissibility. The point m = 0.6 is where the two effect balance each other; for m > 0.6, the decrease in transmissibility dominates the increase in susceptible mask-wearers.

Fig. 5. Plot of the simulated and theoretical critical degree for an epidemic to persist. In our simulations, we generated a contact network with Poisson degree distribution on 5,000 vertices. We averaged over 1,000 independent simulations to generate the simulation data points for the plot.

Fig. 4. Plot of the expected epidemic size conditioned on emergence, as a function of m. While masks decrease the fraction of infections in total (red) and for the non-mask-wearing population (blue), the mask-wearing infections (green) curiously peaks at m = 0.6.
Figure 4 illustrates the effect of the probability of maskwearing, m, on the expected epidemic size. In our simulations, we generated the contact network with 5,000,000 vertices and a Poisson(5) degree distribution. We studied various values of m between 0 and 1. As the fraction of mask-wearing individuals increases, the total number of infections (shown in red) is monotonically decreasing,

In Figure 5, we study how the critical threshold depends on m. As one may expect, as the fraction of mask-wearers increase, a larger mean degree is required for an epidemic to emerge.
C. Epidemic as a function of the baseline transmissibility
In Figure 6, we conside the effect of the baseline transmissibility (i.e., the transmissibility between two non-maskwearers) on the probability of emergence and expected epidemic size. Instead of setting specific values for the transmissibilities in the mask model, we assume that masks have an inward efficiency of Tmask,1 and an outward efficiency of Tmask,2. This implies that the transmission parameters have the form T11 = Tmask,1Tmask,2T , T12 = Tmask,2T and T22 = T . Here, we fix Tmask,1 = 0.3 and Tmask,2 = 0.7 (this reflects the observation that masks have higher outward

efficiency than inward) and we study how the epidemic characteristics change with T . In our simulations, we set m = 0.45 and assumed a Poisson(5) degree distribution and generated networks with 5,000,000 vertices, averaging over 100 independent simulations. In both the probability of emergence and the expected epidemic size, the curves are increasing with T , and an epidemic emerges when T = 0.3. While the simulated probability of emergence deviates from the theoretical curve, we expect to see concentration as we increase the number of experiments.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we studied the effects of mask-wearing on
viral spread, specifically the probability of emergence and
the expected epidemic size conditioned on emergence. We
offered two different perspectives on modeling viral spread
with masks: through a heterogeneous bond percolation ap-
proach on multi-type networks and through an analogy with
a multiple-strain model with mutation. Theoretically, we find
that while the probability of emergence is the same in both
models, the expected epidemic size can be different. We
also show that the expected epidemic size is decreasing
as a function of the fraction of mask-wearing individuals,
confirming that mask-wearing can be an effective strategy in
curbing the spread of COVID-19.

The serial interval and effective reproduction number for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are heterogenous, varying by demographic characteristics, region, and period. During February 1-July 13, 2020, we identified 4,080 transmission pairs in Georgia, USA, by using contact tracing information from COVID-19 cases reported to the Georgia Department of Public Health. We examined how various transmission characteristics were affected by symptoms, demographics, and period (during shelterin-place and after subsequent reopening) and estimated the time course of reproduction numbers for all 159 Georgia counties. Transmission varied by time and place but also by persons' sex and race. The mean serial interval decreased from 5.97 days in February-April to 4.40 days in June-July. Younger adults (20-50 years of age) were involved in most transmission events occurring during or after reopening. The shelter-in-place period was not long enough to prevent sustained virus transmission in densely populated urban areas connected by major transportation links.
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). After it was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, COVID-19 spread rapidly across the world as an ongoing global pandemic. As of July 9, 2021, most confirmed COVID-19 cases (33,792,898 cases) and deaths (606,487) in the world were in the United States (1), and 906,136 confirmed cases and 18,544 deaths were in the state of Georgia (2).

Transmission of COVID-19 varies by region (3,4), setting (long-term care facilities, prisons, and factories) (5), population demographics (age, sex, and race), and even among individual persons (physiologic and behavioral differences) (6). During the early phases of transmission in the United States, new cases were mainly imported by travelers and transmission was associated with human mobility (7). Local transmission was more intense in regions with high population density and in populations with frequent social contacts (3,8,9). When SARS-CoV-2 was introduced into high-risk settings (e.g., long-term care facilities), transmission rates were intense, and the outcomes were often fatal (10).
To study transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we examined the serial interval for symptom onset (defined as the time interval between symptom onset in a primary case-patient and symptom onset in a secondary case-patient infected by the primary casepatient) and the effective reproduction number Rt (the expected number of cases directly caused by any single infectious person). Rt has been shown to vary strongly; some case-patients have caused superspreading events (11,12). Such heterogeneity influences the spread as well as the control of COVID-19, as documented by studies of nonpharmaceutical interventions in China (13,14) and Europe (15) at the province and country levels.
After the first case of COVID-19 was reported in the state of Georgia on March 2, 2020, a series of events and interventions followed (Appendix Table 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/27/10/210061-App1.pdf). On April 3, state officials announced a shelter-in-place order, requiring all residents and visitors to remain in their residence and take every possible precaution to limit social interactions. On

SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Georgia, USA

April 24, officials allowed some businesses to reopen, and on April 30 the shelter-in-place order was lifted. On June 1, state officials further relaxed restrictions. During June-July 2020, as new COVID-19 cases continued to surge in Georgia and other states, knowing how shelter-in-place and the subsequent reopening events affected the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in different regions became crucial.
Identifying a large number of the primary and secondary case-patient pairs enabled us to estimate the distribution of the serial interval for symptom onset. Using the serial interval distribution, we can estimate the time-varying Rt (16). With Rts over time, we can study the spatial distribution of transmission across all 159 Georgia counties as well as the effects of shelter-in-place and subsequent gradual reopening.
The Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH) Institutional Review Board determined that this analysis was exempt from the requirement for review and approval, and informed consent was not required. This activity was reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and was consistent with their applicable policy and with federal law.
Methods
Data Source GDPH provided data for all 118,491 confirmed COVID-19 cases in all 159 counties of Georgia during February 1-July 13, 2020. Available data included demographic characteristics (age, sex, and race), clinical characteristics (dates of symptom onset, recorded symptoms, hospitalization, and ventilator use), and social contacts (contacts between confirmed casepatients and if cases were part of a confirmed outbreak) (Table; Appendix Table 2). Missing values in the data were common; large percentages of values for clinical characteristics were missing. With regard to events possibly driving transmission, periods were categorized as early transmission and shelter-in-place during February-April, after reopening (shelter-inplace order was lifted) in May, and further reopening (more restrictions were relaxed) during June-July (Appendix Table 1). For this study, we defined a COVID-19 case as SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription PCR irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.
Tracked Pairs: Serial Intervals and Characteristics of Transmission On the basis of reported contacts with confirmed casepatients, we identified pairs of primary and secondary case-patients by using the following procedure.

First, most transmission pairs could be established as a unique close contact with a confirmed case-patient. We assumed that symptom onset for any primary case-patient in a confirmed pair occurred before symptom onset of the secondary case-patient. Second, when an outbreak involved multiple cases, we assigned primary case-patients according to review of the epidemiologic time lines. Usually, there was 1 case-patient whose symptom onset was several days earlier than that of the rest of the case-patients in the cluster, and this case-patient was designated as the primary case-patient. Thus, serial intervals were assumed to be always positive. To examine the influence of ignoring negative serial intervals on Rt estimation, we conducted a sensitivity analysis (Appendix Supplemental Material C). Transmission pairs with serial intervals >15 days were dropped because such long intervals are unlikely, as shown in previous studies (17,18). We modeled the serial interval as a gamma distribution and obtained maximum-likelihood estimators of shape and scale parameters. Furthermore, we explored whether the duration of the serial interval varied by demographic characteristics, various disease symptoms, and periods of symptom onset for primary case-patients. The large numbers of tracked case-patient pairs also enabled us to examine variation in transmission within and between different groups by age, sex, and race.
Confirmed Cases: Reproduction Numbers We estimated probabilities of transmission between any pairs of case-patients in an outbreak by using a transmission probability matrix method (Appendix Supplemental Material B) (16). Using GDPH data for confirmed COVID-19 cases during February 1-July 13, 2020, we estimated Rts by date, and we used dates of symptom onset and social contact information (wherever available) in each county independently by estimating the transmission probability matrix.
Among 118,491 confirmed cases, the date of symptom onset was missing for 48,893 (41.3%). These missing symptom-onset dates were imputed according to dates of first specimen collection if available or dates of laboratory report if not (Appendix Supplemental Material A).
The most recent data are incomplete because not all incident cases have been reported and not all persons have become symptomatic. Therefore, estimates of Rt approaching the present date are biased. Because one of our study goals was to examine the timing and magnitude of the first 2 waves of SARSCoV-2 transmission in Georgia (and not to nowcast transmission), we removed Rt estimates of the most

recent 4 weeks (June 16-July 13) from the analysis. SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Georgia seemed to include multiple waves and varied considerably among counties. The time-varying average Rt estimates were smoothed by using LOESS regression, and local maximums/minimum were identified for each individual county. On the basis of our review of the epidemic curves and curves, we defined the following 5 transmission patterns:
· Consistent spreading: there was sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (Rt >1) during the shelterin-place period. Consequently, numbers of cases remained high and increased rapidly at reopening.

· Two strong waves: a first wave of early transmission was followed by a slowdown (Rt <1) during the shelter-in-place period and a new surge in cases (1  Rt <2) after reopening.
· Strong first wave: there was a considerable number of cases during the initial period of the outbreak. During the shelter-in-place period, spreading was controlled; after reopening no new surge in cases occurred (Rt <1).
· Strong second wave: there were few cases during the early transmission period, but new cases surged (Rt 2) after reopening.
· Small case number (<200): SARS-CoV-2 transmission was rare.

SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Georgia, USA

We generated maps to spatially examine the spreading of the COVID-19 first wave. We evaluated the effect of shelter-in-place, reopening, and further reopening by the trend of reproduction numbers before and after those events in different regions of Georgia.
Results
Tracked Pairs: Serial Intervals On the basis of 4,080 tracked pairs of primary and linked secondary case-patients in Georgia (Appendix Table 3), we estimated the serial interval distribution as a gamma distribution with a mean (10th-90th percentile) of 4.99 (1.32-9.71) days. Generally, the serial interval was longer when outcomes for primary case-patients were severe, such as hospitalization, undergoing ventilation, having an abnormal chest radiograph result, or death as final outcome (Appendix Table 4). Specific signs/symptoms in primary case-patients (i.e., fever, cough, shortness of breath, or diarrhea) did not shorten serial intervals. Serial intervals did not differ across demographic categories (i.e., age, sex, race, or location). The mean (10th-90th percentile) serial interval was 5.97 (1.65-11.50) days in February-April, 5.03 (1.41-9.65) days in May, and 4.40 (1.18-8.52) days in June-July (Figure 1). The average serial interval became shorter over time: from 5.97 (1.65- 11.50) days in February-April, to 5.03 (1.41-9.65) days in May, and then to 4.40 (1.18-8.52) days in June-July (Appendix Figure 1).
Tracked Pairs: Characteristics of Transmission To study the variation in transmission by demographic characteristic (i.e., age, sex, and race), the observed frequencies in transmission pairs can be

shown in a matrix (Figure 2, panels A, B). Male casepatients were twice as likely to transmit infection to a female than a male contact, whereas female casepatients were equally likely to transmit infection to a male or a female contact. Transmission between races was strongly assortative. White and Black persons were more likely to transmit infection to persons of their own races than to persons of other races; White persons were 4.4 times as likely to transmit infection to White persons, and Black persons were 5.6 times as likely to transmit infection to Black persons.
SARS-CoV-2 seemed to mainly spread from adults 20-60 years of age during February-July 2020; transmission between children (<20 years) and elderly persons (>60 years) was observed less often, suggesting that transmission occurred more frequently between persons of similar ages (Figure 3, panels A-D). Transmission between persons of different sexes was mainly among those in the same age group. Cases in persons 10-30 years of age were associated with most transmission pairs of the same sex. Over the study period, most transmission pairs shifted from 40-70 years of age (median age for primary case-patients was 52 years and for secondary case-patients was 50 years) in February-April to 20-50 years of age (primary case-patient median age 36 years and secondary case-patient median age 34 years) in June-July (Figure 4).
Temporal and Spatial Patterns of Transmission During February and March, Rts were >1 and then decreased until late April and early May, considered the first wave in Georgia. Rt usually decreased to a (mathematical) local minimum during the shelter-inplace period and started to increase again as the second wave began. As during the first wave, Rts peaked and then started to decrease again during the second wave (Figure 5). Although the number of reported cases was lower in first wave, Rt was much higher in the first wave (3.5) than in the second wave (1.7).
Although the general pattern of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was similar across all counties, the dates of local maximums/minimum (i.e., first peak, local minimum, and second peak) and the magnitude of Rt at these extremes varied among counties. The peak dates for the first wave in counties with cumulative case numbers was >200 cases by July 13, 2020 (Figure 6, panel A). At that time, counties with high numbers of COVID-19 cases were located around cities and along highways. Starting in early February, COVID-19 spread radially and along the interstate highway from Atlanta and Albany, the 2 initial outbreak sources. Outbreaks occurred later in other

were reported. On the basis of the magnitude of Rt at the first peak, local minimum, and second peak, we categorized case data into the 5 transmission patterns (Figure 5; Appendix Figures 11-169).
Consistent spreading occurred in Georgia counties around some major cities (e.g., Atlanta, Athens, Columbus, Savannah) and counties along interstate highways (Figure 6, panel B). In counties bordering other counties with consistent spreading, there were 2 strong waves or only a strong second wave. An early intense first wave but not a strong second wave occurred in counties around the city of Albany (Lee, Sumter, Terrell, Mitchell, Crisp, and Dooly Counties). Fewer cases occurred in counties not connected by interstate highways.
Discussion During February-July, the estimated serial intervals for onset of COVID-19 symptoms in the state of Georgia seemed to become shorter (Figure 1). Such a phenomenon was also observed in mainland China during January-February 2020 (19). Shorter serial intervals imply more rapid transmission. During February-July, disease prevalence increased in Georgia; by August 25, Georgia had the fifth highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States. One cause of contracting serial intervals could be that persons had more contacts after reopening; in particular, younger persons (20-50 years) might play a larger role in SARSCoV-2 transmission. Also, Kenah et al. showed that increasingly more infectious case-patients are present in the local population, competing to infect susceptible persons, and the expected time until a new infection is shortened (20).

The serial interval estimation could also be affected by changing testing practices and contact tracing over the duration of the pandemic. COVID-19 testing capacity and contact tracing ability in Georgia were limited during earlier stages of the pandemic; thus, identification and isolation of COVID-19 casepatients and their close contacts were often delayed. With improved testing capacity, symptomatic casepatients were tested more promptly and isolated more quickly, which led to fewer exposures during their infectious periods. Rapid isolation and contact tracing could truncate transmission and lead to shorten serial intervals. More recent data collected when testing and contact tracing have improved are less likely to be affected by delayed testing and isolation. Contraction of serial intervals continued into May through early July, so the changes may still be explained at least partly by increased prevalence and increased contact rates (Figure 1).
Transmission of a respiratory infection such as COVID-19 depends on behavioral factors and in particular on social contacts. Studies of contact behavior have shown that persons tend to have social contact with peers of similar age and demographic backgrounds (21). The tracked transmission pairs in this study show that such assortative mixing also applies to SARS-CoV-2 transmission (Figure 2). The transmission pairs in this study were more likely to be tracked when case-patients knew each other (e.g., family members, friends, or colleagues), whereas transmission in public spaces (e.g., stores or restaurants) usually could not be tracked. Transmission occurs frequently among persons in the same age group and less frequently among those in different age

groups (Figure 3), although transmission may have been across generations (e.g., between parents and children, or grandparents and grandchildren) (22).
A primary case-patient who was male was more likely to transmit infection to a female contact than to a male contact. Female case-patients were infected by male case-patients across a wide range of ages (Figure 3, panel B), and male case-patients were mainly infected by young male case-patients (Figure 3, panel A). A possible explanation may be that female persons tend to be caregivers, taking care of sick persons in the household, and young male persons may be more likely to acquire infection outside the household.

Similar to the serial interval, transmission patterns also changed as the pandemic continued. The major contribution to spreading SARS-CoV-2 shifted over time to the younger generation. This shift could be caused by elderly persons becoming more careful to protect themselves from infection by taking measures such as staying at home, wearing face masks in public spaces, and observing good hand hygiene. At the same time, younger persons might have been less compliant with quarantine measures and more likely to attend indoor gatherings such as parties or to have visited bars, gyms, and clubs while not wearing face masks.
Previous pandemics, such as the 1918 influenza and the 2009 swine influenza (H1N1) pandemics,

caused multiple waves of infections (23). In Georgia, we have so far observed 2 waves of SARS-CoV-2 transmission separated by the shelter-in-place period. The COVID-19 cases of the first wave were first observed in Atlanta, the state capital with one of the busiest US airports, and Albany, the eighth largest city in Georgia. The outbreak in Albany resulted from 2 superspreading funeral events. However, the connectivity of these 2 cities differs: Atlanta is a transportation hub that connects multiple interstate highways, whereas Albany has no interstate highways. During the first wave, SARS-CoV-2 spread radially from both cities to the surrounding areas. For Atlanta, cases also started to appear along the interstate highways

(Figure 6, panel A). Concentrations of increased transmission along highways, as links connecting population centers, suggest that commuter links might have been effective transmission links.
During the shelter-in-place period (April 3- April 30), SARS-CoV-2 transmission slowed and Rts reached a local minimum in most counties. However, before reopening, Rts were still >1 in many counties even at the local minimum, indicating continued disease spread (Figure 6, panel B). After reopening, transmission again increased across Georgia. These data suggest that the 3 or 4 weeks of shelter-in-place orders were not long enough to sufficiently suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission (local and imported) in

densely populated urban areas connected by major transportation links.
Thus far, the second wave has been heterogenous in time and magnitude in different counties. Local prevalence was different at the time of reopening, and counties where prevalence was high (i.e., counties bordering cities and along interstate highways) experienced a stronger second wave. Counties not connected by major transportation links (e.g., around Albany) often also saw a second wave of COVID-19 but on a relatively small scale. Some counties that experienced an early and intense first wave (e.g., Lee, Sumter, Terrell, and Mitchell) did not experience a second wave. Possibly, inhabitants of those counties were more compliant with the prevention and control measures.
A limitation of our study is that although data were available for >100,000 cases, clinical information and contacts with a confirmed case-patient were missing on some records. Absence of clinical information may depend on several factors. For example, reporting rates tend to be lower and clinical information more frequently missing for case-patients with mild or no symptoms than for case-patients with severe symptoms. A subgroup analysis showed similar distributions of serial intervals for transmission pairs with complete clinical information and transmission pairs with missing clinical information. This finding lends credibility to the assumption that the absence of clinical information does not affect the overall serial interval.
Data on tracked pairs were not missing at random because contact tracing is voluntary and its capacity was limited during the early stages of the pandemic. Tracked pairs were more likely to be recorded when they involved known contacts. Identifying transmission links in public spaces or within clusters of cases remains challenging.
In this study, presymptomatic transmission leading to negative serial intervals was ignored because infectors could rarely be determined by exposure information or travel history. On the basis of the sensitivity analysis (Appendix Supplemental Material C), the influence of a small proportion of negative serial intervals on Rt estimates could safely be ignored.
When examining the time course of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Georgia, asymptomatic transmission was ignored. The observed numbers of case-patients thus underestimate the numbers of infected (infectious) persons, but this underestimation does not imply that Rt is underestimated by the same amount. Both the numbers of primary case-patients (transmitting infection) and the numbers of secondary

case-patients (acquiring infection) are underestimated, so the estimated rate of increase is likely to be less affected (24).
In conclusion, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Georgia changed over time during February-July 2020. The mean serial interval decreased from 5.97 days in February-April to 4.40 days in June-July. The younger population (20-50 years of age) was involved in most transmission events during or after reopening subsequent to the shelter-in-place period. By mid-July, 2 waves of SARS-CoV-2 transmission were apparent, separated by the shelter-in-place period in Georgia. Transmission was more intense in counties around major cities and along interstate highways. These transmission patterns can be used to help predict and guide states in COVID-19 prevention and control according to population and region.

Multiple Transmission Chains within COVID-19 Cluster, Connecticut, USA, 20201

In fall 2020, a coronavirus disease cluster comprising 16 cases occurred in Connecticut, USA. Epidemiologic and genomic evidence supported transmission among persons at a school and fitness center but not a workplace. The multiple transmission chains identified within this cluster highlight the necessity of a combined investigatory approach.
During widespread community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), transmission chains are sometimes unclear. Although often unavailable, viral genome sequencing can complement epidemiologic investigations.
In fall 2020, the Connecticut Department of Public Health analyzed date from contact tracing interviews and initially identified 5 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, in employees of a single workplace within 1 week. One employee also worked at an elementary school and fitness center; in those settings, several contacts of this employee later tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. At the time, the weekly community case rate in this county was 141 cases/100,000 persons (https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/COVID-19-Data-Tracker), reflecting high community transmission according to thresholds set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (1). To better characterize this cluster, we investigated its scope, phylogenetic relationships, and factors associated with transmission.

The Study We defined a cluster-associated case as COVID-19 in a coworker, primary contact, or secondary contact of the initial 5 employees; all cases were diagnosed by a viral test (i.e., antigen or nucleic acid amplification tests) authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration (2). We defined the investigation period as starting 1 week before symptom onset of the earliest workplace case and ending 2 weeks after symptom onset of the last workplace case. We assessed symptoms, onset dates, adherence to prevention strategies, and potential exposures. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted in accordance with applicable federal law and CDC policy (e.g. 45 C.F.R. part 46.102(l) [2], 21 C.F.R. part 56; 42 U.S.C. 241(d); 5 U.S.C. 552a; 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).
We extracted SARS-CoV-2 RNA from clinical nasopharyngeal specimens and conducted genomic sequencing using an amplicon-based approach with the MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, https:// nanoporetech.com) (3). We reconstructed maximumlikelihood phylogenetic trees using IQ-Tree with a general time-reversible nucleotide substitution model (4) (Appendix 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/ EID/article/27/10/21-1196-App1.pdf; Appendix 2 Table, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/27/10/ 21-1196-App2.xlsx).
Overall, we identified 16 cluster-associated cases in 6 workplace employees, 3 school staff members and students, 2 fitness center attendees, and 5 household contacts. Symptom onset was generally earlier among workplace employees than among school and fitness center contacts (Figure 1).
The workplace employed 35 persons and provided in-person customer service. After the first

employee (W-1) experienced symptoms on day 1 and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the workplace closed and recommended SARS-CoV-2 screening for other employees. In addition to the 5 initial cases, we identified 1 other case in a workplace employee (Figure 1). All 6 employees worked during the week before their symptoms began (Appendix 1 Figure 1).
In total, 4 of the 6 employees agreed to be interviewed (Appendix 1 Table 1). W-1 reported a potential exposure outside the workplace during the week before symptom onset. Two employees (W-2 and W-5) had contact with each other outside of work. No other employees reported contact with coworkers or members of coworkers' households outside the workplace. Some employees were unable to maintain 6 feet of distance from coworkers and occasionally removed masks near coworkers. To increase air circulation, ventilation system fans were run continuously. Customers were not required to wear masks, and customer visits lasted 45-60 minutes.
One employee (W-3) also worked at an elementary school that offered in-person education 5 days a week. W-3 worked at the school on outbreak days 1-3; W-3's symptoms developed on day 3. Three school contacts of W-3 subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection: a staff member (S-1) and 2 students (S-2 and S-3). S-1, a staff member, spent most of their time in a neighboring classroom but had brief contact with W-3 while substituting for W-3's classroom. W-3 and S-1 reported strict adherence to prevention measures, including masking and social distancing, and did not have contact outside of school. To improve ventilation, the classroom windows were kept open. Among 15 students in W-3's classroom, 2 asymptomatic students (S-2 and S-3) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. S-2 was tested after a family member (S-2 [HH1]) had COVID-19

symptoms; another family member (S-2 [HH2]) later experienced symptoms as well. S-3 was tested after being notified that another person in the classroom tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
W-3 taught an indoor fitness class on day 2, the day before their symptom onset. Approximately 6 clients attended the 1-hour class. Attendee F-1 experienced symptoms on day 5; attendee F-2 experienced symptoms on day 7. A household contact of F-2 (F-2 [HH]) later tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. W-3 and F-1 reported that attendees wore masks before and after the class but removed them during distanced (i.e., >6 feet) exercise. Information regarding facility ventilation was unavailable.
We acquired 13 specimens for viral genome sequencing. Specimens were unavailable for 2 workplace employees (W-2 and W-5) and 1 student household contact (S-2 [HH2]). The resulting genomes clustered into 2 separate lineages (Appendix 1 Figure 2). Cluster 1 comprised 11 genomes, of which 9 were identical or differed by 1 mutation. These 9 genomes were extracted from samples from W-3, W-3's household contact, the school staff and students, the fitness center attendees, and household contacts of persons at the school and fitness center (Figure 2). The other 2 genomes in cluster 1 were isolated from W-1 and W-6. W-1 was the only employee to work during the infectious period (defined as beginning 2 days before symptom onset); however, sequences for W-3 and W-6 differed from W-1's sequence by >3 mutations. Cluster 2 comprised genomes isolated from a workplace employee and the household contact of another employee (Figure 2); there was no known epidemiologic link between these 2 persons.
Conclusions We found that the 16 members of a single COVID-19 cluster were involved in multiple transmission chains.

during indoor exercise was mandated in Connecticut later in November 2020 (9).
Genomic data did not indicate SARS-CoV-2 transmission among workplace employees. Divergence among viral sequences of workplace employees and the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate of 1 mutation per 2 weeks (10) suggest that the 4 other workplace cases were each acquired independently. However, workplace transmission from unidentified employees or customers remains possible. In addition, a workplace employee and household contact had unrelated sequences, suggesting that they also were infected independently (Figure 2). This apparent workplace cluster, disproven by sequencing, highlights challenges in defining transmission chains during widespread SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. These findings highlight the crucial role of genomic sequencing in clarifying transmission chains.

Figure 2. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree for coronavirus disease cluster, Connecticut, USA, 2020. Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 (GISAID accession no. EPI_ISL_402125; https://www.gisaid. org) and Wuhan/WH01/2019 (accession no. EPI_ISL_406798) were used as reference genomes. Workplace employee W-3 (asterisk) had contacts in the school and fitness center. Colors correspond with presumed transmission chains based on epidemiologic and genomic data. W, workplace; S, school; F, fitness center; [HH], household.
Epidemiologic and genomic evidence supported transmission in the school and fitness center but not the workplace. These findings highlight challenges in accurate delineation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains and emphasize the benefits of combined epidemiologic and genomic investigation.
Although diagnostic specimens are often discarded by laboratories soon after testing, rapid identification of this cluster enabled the acquisition of specimens from 13 of the 16 cases. Our results suggest that infection was directly transmitted from W-3 to >6 other persons within their household, school, and fitness center. Classroom transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is uncommon in the context of prevention strategies such as masking and distancing; previous studies have suggested that most school-associated cases are acquired outside of school (5,6). However, our results suggest that staff-to-staff and staff-to-student transmission occurred in this classroom. This investigation also adds to evidence that indoor exercise without masks can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission (7,8). Fitness centers might consider moving high-exertion exercise outdoors, improving ventilation, and promoting mask use during indoor exercise. Mask use

Role of Oral Rabies Vaccines in Eliminang Death in People from Dog Bites

Rabies vaccines are highly effecve, but delivering them can be challenging. The challenge is even greater for stray animals, which might not trust a stranger trying
to deliver a life-saving vaccinaon.
How can public health officials ensure that stray dogs (and the people around them) are protected against
rabies? Some researchers may have an answer: Oral vaccines in dog treats.
In this EID podcast, Dr. Ryan Wallace, a CDC veterinary epidemiologist, explains an innovave strategy for delivering safe and effecve oral vaccines.

In May 2021, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was detected in Asiatic lions in a zoological park in India. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed the SARS-CoV-2 strains were the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant. To reduce transmission of variants of concern, surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wild animal populations should be increased.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in natural conditions, has shown a broad host susceptibility range (1). Identifying susceptible animal species, reservoirs, and cross-species transmission is a global scientific and public health concern. We found evidence of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) caused by the lineage B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant (World Health Organization nomenclature). We provide coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case information and detailed genomic characterization.
Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Chennai, India, houses 13 Asiatic lions, 9 in a lion safari and 2 each in separate moat enclosures. Beginning May 21, 2021, four of the safari lions started showing signs of loss of appetite, nasal discharge, and occasional coughing. Nasal swab, rectal swab, and fecal samples were collected from 11 lions during May 24-29, 2021, and sent to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (Bhopal, India) for molecular investigations (Appendix Table 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/ article/27/10/21-1500-App1.pdf).
We used the VIRALDTECT II Multiplex Real Time PCR Kit for COVID-19 (Genes2Me, https://genes2me. com) to confirm SARS-CoV-2 in 9/11 lions. The other 2 lions were sampled on June 19, 2021, and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. We also used a World Organisation for Animal Health-recommended reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) method to test for canine distemper virus on samples from all 13 lions; all tested negative (2). Two of the infected lions died of COVID-19, one on June 3 and the other on June 16, 2021.
After we confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed whole-genome sequencing directly from nasal swab specimens of 4 lions that initially showed symptoms by using the MinION sequencing platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, https://nanoporetech. com) (Appendix). We deposited sequences in GenBank (accession nos. MZ363851-4) and GISAID (https:// www.gisaid.org; accession nos. EPI_ISL_2821077-80).
To elucidate the temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 among the lions, we downloaded 310 complete SARSCoV-2 genomes from GISAID (3) that had high coverage and were sequenced from the Tamil Nadu state of

India, where the zoological park is located, during January 1-June 11, 2021. To generate a set of representative sequences, we used a UCLUST algorithm (4) to select sequences that clustered at the 99.9% identity threshold. We used MAFFT version 7.475 (5) to align representative SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID with sequences from the lions; then we constructed a phylogenetic tree by using the general time reversible plus gamma model in RAxML version 8.2.12 (6) (Figure).
The amino acid substitutions and deletions in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in lions typically matched with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (Appendix Table 2). We noted amino acid changes in the N terminal domain (NTD), including T19R, G142D, E156del, F157del, R158G; in the receptor binding motif (RBM), including L452R and T478K; and in D614G of subdomain 2. We also noted a substitution close to S1/ S2 protease cleavage site at P681R and heptad repeat 1 at D950N (Appendix Figures 1, 2). In addition, the lion sequences had the K77T substitution in the NTD, which has been detected in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 24 countries. In India, frequency of the K77T substitution generally is low (0.44%) but occurred in 27.42% (65/237) of sequences in the B.1.167.2 lineage collected in Tamil Nadu state (Appendix Table 2).
The changes in the spike protein, including E156del, F157del, and R158G, of lion sequences were not found in human SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the same geographic area, nor were changes in nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) V88I, possibly because SARS-CoV-2 sequencing is limited in the region. Furthermore, these changes in spike and NS3 were not seen in previously reported lion SARS-CoV-2 sequences, ruling out the possibility that these are host-adapted mutations (7) (Appendix Figure 3). Further investigations could delineate whether

changes in the spike protein, namely E156del, F157del, R158G, and K77T, are escape mutants or are associated with increased transmissibility or pathogenicity.
A nucleotide similarity comparison of the 4 lion SARS-CoV-2 sequences against the sequences available in GISAID and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the lion sequences closely matched with a representative human SARS-CoV-2 sequence of B.1.617.2 lineage, GISAID accession no. EPI_ISL_2463770, that comprises 152 viral genome pools collected from the same geographic region during the same month that the lions' samples were collected (Figure; Appendix Figure 4). The park's management strictly adhered to COVID-19 guidelines and did not introduce any new animals to the zoo during India's widespread COVID-19 pandemic. The primary source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lions might have been an asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic person. Among the 9 infected lions, 7 were in the lion safari and shared a common habitat, shelter, feeding spaces, and water sources. The other 2 infected lions were on display in separate enclosures that shared a common moat. Because shared habitats offered opportunities for close physical contact, identifying genetically identical SARS-CoV-2 infections in these lions in a short period of time indicates the possibility of lion-to-lion transmission.
In conclusion, evidence of confirmed natural SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant infections in Asiatic lions in India justifies need for increased SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in wild animal species. In addition, strict biosecurity measures should be implemented for wild animals kept in captivity.

A 72-year-old immunocompromised man infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 received bamlanivimab monotherapy. Viral evolution was monitored in nasopharyngeal and blood samples by melting curve analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and whole-genome sequencing. Rapid emergence of spike receptor binding domain mutations was found, associated with a compartmentalization of viral populations.
A72-year-old immunocompromised man in France who had chronic lymphocytic leukemia associated with hypogammaglobinemia for 4 years experienced diarrhea, asthenia, fever, and cough associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Although he had received 1 injection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2; Pfizer/BioNTech, https://www.pfizer.com) 20 days earlier, we confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 by using a semiquantitative SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) viral load assay. This assay showed a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 27 for a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. His most recent monoclonal antibody (mAb) chemotherapy treatment (venetoclax and rituximab) had been conducted 17 days earlier. Because of his immunocompromised status, treatment with bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555), a neutralizing IgG1 mAb, was initiated at day 0, 4 days after onset of symptoms (Table). The patient received an infusion of 700 mg in a single dose and was discharged.
Analysis of samples showed a high viral load in a nasopharyngeal swab specimen (Ct 20) and a blood sample (Ct 37) (Table). Three days after the mAb infusion, the patient's symptoms worsened, and he was hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department at Grenoble Hospital (Grenoble, France) on day 6. The condition of the patient had deteriorated; he had an additional need for oxygen, which resulted in a convalescent-phase plasma transfusion on day 10.
After this treatment, the condition of the patient continued to deteriorate, and he was transferred to

The pioneering work of Taylor on the turbulent dispersion of aerosols is one century old and provides an interesting way to introduce both diffusive processes and turbulence at an undergraduate level. Low mass particles transported by a turbulent flow exhibit a Brownian-like motion over time scales larger than the velocity correlation time. Aerosols and gases are, therefore, subjected to an effective turbulent diffusion at large length scales. However, the case of a source of pollutant much smaller than the integral scale is not completely understood. Here, we present experimental results obtained by undergraduate students in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dispersion of a fog of oil droplets by a turbulent flow is studied in a wind tunnel designed for pedagogical purposes. It shows a ballistic-like regime at short distance, followed by Taylor's diffusive-like regime, suggesting that scale-free diffusion by the turbulent cascade process is bypassed. Measurements show that the dispersion of CO2 emitted when breathing in a natural, indoor air flow is not isotropic but rather along the flow axis. The transverse spread is ballistic-like, leading to the concentration decaying as the inverse-squared distance to the mouth. The experiment helps students understand the role of fluctuations in diffusive processes and in turbulence. A Langevin equation governing aerosol dispersion based on a single correlation time allows us to model the airborne transmission risk of pathogens, indoors and outdoors. The results obtained in this study have been used to provide public health policy recommendations to prevent transmission in shopping malls. # 2022 Published under an exclusive license by American Association of Physics Teachers. https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0064826

I. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of offering experimental physics courses online during the COVID-19 pandemic motivated the following question: can students learn experimental techniques during lockdowns while simultaneously working to reduce viral transmission risk indoors? A group of students studying experimental physics at our university worked on several projects to reduce the risk of airborne transmission of SARSCoV-2, including the filtration efficiency of face masks, the calibration of CO2 sensors using candles or dry ice in a closed transparent box, and the analysis of epidemic data. We report here the work on a project to understand the dispersion of viral particles both indoors and outdoors. This project has required a detailed understanding of both diffusion processes and turbulent flows.
However, turbulence is not an easy subject to teach. At the undergraduate level, topics in fluid mechanics mainly include hydrostatics, potential laminar flows, and viscous flows. The concept of turbulence appears when teaching the drag force exerted on a moving spherical solid as a function of the Reynolds number (see, e.g., Ref. 1). In this approach, one of the fundamental aspects of turbulence, namely, space and time fluctuations, is bypassed. Here, we show that turbulence can be taught by considering the dispersion of particles in a regime where concentration is low enough that it acts as a passive scalar field; that is, the concentration has no dynamical effect on the flow. We treat this dispersion theoretically in Sec. II and also present very simple experiments. In Sec. III, we make use of controlled experiments performed both in a small wind tunnel used for pedagogical purposes, using a fog of oil droplets, and in the large corridors of two shopping malls under various ventilation conditions

using CO2. We show that the concentration decays faster than expected by the turbulent dispersion theory of Taylor,2 following instead a ballistic law. Indeed, introducing a single velocity decorrelation time provides a perfect fit to the data. This suggests, as shown previously by Villermaux et al.,3,4 that concentration fluctuations bypass the turbulent cascade: diffusion does not follow a continuous process starting from the injection scale and down to the dissipation scale.5 The Kolmogorov scaling law is not observed. The work presented here can be used to introduce students to the turbulent dispersion not only of pollutant molecules but also of aerosols. We finally discuss the relevance of the results to the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which has motivated this research. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through the airborne route:6 infection happens when a susceptible person inhales viral particles emitted by another infected person. In between their respective respiratory tracts, the air carrying viral particles is gradually diluted by turbulent dispersion. Near an emitter, the concentration of viral particles is, therefore, higher than far away, which has implications on the airborne transmission risk.
II. TURBULENT DISPERSION OF PARTICLES
A. Brownian motion
We first consider the one-dimensional diffusive transport of a particle of diameter d, mass m, and density qp in a gas of viscosity g without turbulence. The force exerted by the gas on the particle can be decomposed into two parts: the average hydrodynamic Stokes1 force À3pgdv and a noise7 CðtÞ, which describes the thermal fluctuations around this average. The particle dynamics is described by the Langevin equation

where the damping term is the Stokes force, rewritten after
introducing the Stokes time sS, which is the particle velocity response time to a force. CðtÞ is only known statistically as it results from the random collisions of gas molecules with the
particle, which are uncorrelated. Therefore, we define the ensemble average Á as the average over many realizations of the motion with different values of the noise. The noise is Gaussian, has zero mean, and is d-correlated in time7

where d stands for the Dirac delta function. Equation (1) is a linear relaxation equation: the homoge-

neous solution decays to zero at times much longer than the
relaxation time sS. Particle inertia, which drives the homogeneous solution, can, therefore, be neglected in the t ) sS limit. In this overdamped case, the particle velocity is directly proportional to the noise force: vðtÞ ¼ sSCðtÞ=m.

The noise does not induce any average motion: vðtÞ ¼ 0. However, as the velocities are d-correlated in time, the particle diffuses around its initial position xðt ¼ 0Þ ¼ 0 with a

B. Turbulent diffusion
We focus here on the motion of particles transported by a turbulent air flow of mean velocity u along the x axis in cylindrical coordinates ðr; h; xÞ. L denotes the typical largescale length, which is in our case set by the transverse dimensions of the space. The Reynolds number Re compares inertia with viscous effects
Re ¼ uL ; (5) 
with  being the kinematic viscosity of air. When Re is large enough, typically above 103, the fluid motion given by the Eulerian velocity field uðr; tÞ becomes unsteady, chaotic, and irregular. We, therefore, treat this field statistically by using the Reynolds decomposition: we split u into its ensemble average u, which is a drift velocity, and its fluctuating part with zero mean u0, i.e., u ¼ u þ u0.10 Likewise, we decompose the particle velocities v into v and v0. The typical particle fluctuating velocity rV is the root mean squared fluctuating velocity r2V  v02 .

It has been argued in a pioneering article by Taylor2 published one century ago that turbulent dispersion, induced by the random velocity fluctuations, is diffusive. The particle dynamical equation reads
mv_ ¼ À m ðv À uðrÞÞ: (6) sS

The thermal noise C of Eq. (1) is negligible compared to tur-

bulent fluctuations. Likewise, we neglect particle inertia for

timescales longer than sS, which is the case if the particles

are light enough. Particles, therefore, move with the fluid: v ¼ u and v0 ¼ u0 so that their velocity correlation functions

are the same: v0ðtÞv0ðt þ sÞ ¼ u0ðtÞu0ðt þ sÞ. As the fluctuating velocity u0 acts as a noise, Taylor's picture of turbulent

diffusion is a Brownian-like motion analogous to molecular

diffusion. The turbulent kinetic energy plays the role of

temperature.

We assume that longitudinal diffusion along the direction

of the average air flow is negligible compared to advective

transport, and we inject many particles at the origin with

mass rate m_ . Turbulent dispersion, therefore, only creates a

transverse mean squared displacement rR with zero mean.

As the individual particle probability distributions are identi-

cally distributed, the probability of finding a particle at trans-

verse radial position r will be Gaussian, according to the central limit theorem, i.e., proportional to exp ðÀr2=ð2r2RÞÞ. The average concentration C is proportional to this probabil-

ity. The prefactor is set by conservation of mass as the total

concentration along the transverse section must be equal to

In the turbulent regime, the velocity u of an elementary volume of fluid, followed along its Lagrangian path, remains correlated at short times.5,11,12 The velocity of a transported particle is, therefore, correlated as well, which leads to an anomalous diffusion at short distances. Because the particles have negligible inertia, their velocities are the fluid velocities: velocity correlation results from the underlying flow structure driving their motion rather than from the particle dynamics. On a phenomenological ground, the simplest hypothesis would be to assume that the velocity fluctuation is a low-pass filtered noise associated with a typical relaxation time T. We assume that an elementary volume of fluid follows a Langevin equation of the type of Eq. (1) driven by a white noise with a linear friction term and including inertia. The particle velocity correlation, which is equal to the fluid velocity correlation, is not a Dirac d as previously but decays exponentially7-9,13

III. EXPERIMENTS
A. Field experimental setup
We performed "field" experiments in the large corridors of two commercial malls and of our university during lockdown, while they were empty. The experimental setup is schematized in Fig. 1. A controlled CO2 source of constant mass rate m_ was obtained by sublimating dry ice sticks in an open cylindrical container of diameter 20 cm heated by a power controlled hot plate. The source was positioned at height 1.1 m above the ground. The imposed sublimation rate, measured using a scale, was equal to m_ ¼ 1:5 g=s. This rate was chosen to measure CO2 concentrations with high relative accuracy without saturating the sensors.

The gas produced is convected downstream by the small draft blowing in the corridor where the CO2 concentration is recorded. The scale measures the mass injection rate m_ .

Our initial motivation was to characterize the dispersion of breath in public spaces. The source used generated CO2 at about 150 times the exhalation rate of an adult at rest. This increased generation rate does not change the dispersion equations as the measured CO2 concentration is still very small in the 10À5À10À4 volume fraction range. The experiment had been designed believing that the turbulent dispersion would be statistically isotropic, as expected for an effective diffusion caused by large scale incoherent turbulent motion.14 Instead, our preliminary observations using a source of micron-sized glycerol/water droplets showed that in most large public spaces, there are air drafts causing bulk horizontal transport and biased dispersion. After identification of the mean air flow direction, non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 sensors were placed downstream from the source. They recorded the CO2 concentration C over the duration of each experiment around 30 min. The initial and final values of C were used to determine the background CO2 level Ce.
After an initial short transient time, a concentration field in a statistically steady state was established. CO2 concentration in excess was measured in eight different locations. The draft wind velocity was measured using a hot-wire anemometer. It ranged from 0.1 to 2 m=s depending on the location. The flow Reynolds number Re ¼ uL= was between 105 and 106 with L ' 1 m, the typical corridor scale. Measurements were done with different ventilation flow rates and recycled air fractions; the use of fire safety ventilation, namely, mechanical smoke extractors and smoke vents, was tested when available. Measurements were performed with entrance doors both open and closed as open doors create large drafts in some locations. Control sensors (not shown in Fig. 1) placed immediately upstream to the left and to the right of the source showed no concentration increase: convection dominated over turbulent diffusion.
B. Field results
The concentration measured by each sensor fluctuates over time during the experiment. The sensor response time, around a minute, is much longer than typical turbulent time scales. Noise in the concentration signal only comes from small fluctuations in the wind direction, which tilt around the dispersion cone. To remove these fluctuations, concentration signals for each sensor are averaged over the fraction of time during which the air flow is reasonably aligned with the sensor axis. We consider the two to be aligned when the concentration stays close to its maximum value for that particular sensor for a few minutes. This is the case for about 40% of the duration of each sensor signal. Figure 2 shows that C decays spatially typically as xÀ2. The mass conservation equation provides the scaling law
qCO2 ðC À CeÞ vr2R $ m_ ; (13)
where qCO2 ¼ 1:83 kg=m3 is the density of sublimated CO2. In Fig. 2, the CO2 concentration is rescaled by m_ =qCO2v and plotted as a function of space x. The reasonable collapse between data shows that the CO2 concentration is proportional to the inverse wind velocity v. The fraction of fresh air injected in the ventilation system had no effect on the measured concentrations: in practice, only the local airflow disperses CO2. In other words, the airflow induced to renew air is negligible in comparison to natural air drafts.

The solid curve is the best fit in Eq. (14). The two free parameters are the source size a (here, 0:35 m) and the cone angle a (here, 0.10). The measure-
ments were done at two different locations at the same mall. Red circles and dashed line: human breathing measurements (m_ ¼ 10 mg=s) and its best fit curve (a ¼ 0:27 m and a ¼ 0:14).

The decay of C À Ce is consistent with the overall conical shape of the dispersion zone in the ballistic regime given in Eq. (12). We can parametrize the dilution by

(14)

where a is the dispersion cone angle, determined by the turbulent fluctuation rate rV=v. We find a ¼ 0:35 m, which is close to the actual diameter of the dry ice container and a ¼ 0:10. We have also included in Fig. 2 the CO2 concentration in the wake of a volunteer breathing through the mouth in a faninduced wind of velocity v ¼ 0:3 m=s. We find a % 0:27 m and a slightly higher fluctuation rate a ¼ 0:14 in that case. The fluctuation rate depends on the processes creating the
mean flow (fans, natural indoor air drafts, wind outdoors) and
the geometry, as obstacles upstream destabilize the flow and
create larger fluctuations.

C. Wind tunnel setup
In order to better characterize the turbulent transport at play, we studied after lockdown the dispersion of a fog composed of micrometer-sized oil droplets in a small wind tunnel used for experimental physics student projects, schematized in Fig. 3. The 120 Â 23 Â 23 cm3 test section is illuminated from above by a LED array with a diffuser. A turbulence generating grid (3 Â 3 grid of 7 Â 7 cm2 separated by 1 cm wide bars) is inserted immediately after the air inlet contraction section. u is measured with a hot-wire anemometer (testo 405i). We estimate the flow Reynolds number uL= with L being the grid mesh size to be between 105 and 106-- as in the field experiments. Oil vapor is injected at a controlled rate through a 6 mm nozzle heated by a resistor at a controlled power. A fog of droplets nucleates at few millimeters downstream. The fog is made dilute enough so that double scattering is negligible, and the light intensity scattered is proportional to the local drop concentration. We qualitatively check the dilution by putting the light behind

the tunnel rather than above. High resolution pictures with a 1 or 2 s exposure time are taken with a Digital Single-Lens Reflex camera (Nikon D800). A series of ten pictures under the same conditions is averaged to achieve a satisfying statistical convergence. The mean green channel from the pictures in raw format is used to measure the light intensity. The image of the tunnel without fog is subtracted to remove residual background light. The light intensity profile I0ðxÞ is then calibrated by placing a diffusive black sheet inside the tunnel. I0ðxÞ is flat along the tunnel axis, except at the start and the end of the tunnel where it falls off due to greater distance to the illumination source.
The intensity I ðx; yÞ of a particular pixel is an integral over the z-axis of the scattered intensity. The concentration profile is expected to depend on the distance to the central axis in a Gaussian way: $ exp ðÀððy À y0Þ2 þ ðz À z0Þ2Þ=2r2RÞ.

D. Wind tunnel results
Transverse intensity profiles at regularly spaced distances from the fog injection nozzle are shown in Fig. 4. As the droplets are formed by vaporizing oil, the fog is hot and slightly buoyant so the centerline y0ðxÞ gets slightly shifted upwards. The centerline slope, which is the transverse-tolongitudinal mean particle velocity ratio, is at most 10À2, allowing any additional effects of this heating to be ignored. The profiles are nicely fitted by a Gaussian, which leads to the measurement of the three parameters of Eq. (15): the concentration on the axis, C, the radius rR, and the centerline y0ðxÞ. Assuming that v is constant along the flow axis, mass conservation imposes that CðxÞr2RðxÞv must be constant proportional to the rate of emission by the source. Figure 5 shows typical profiles CðxÞr2RðxÞ, which are indeed flat outside the injection zone. It means that the droplets, once nucleated, do not change much and keep the same light scattering properties; this validates the use of this measurement technique.

Figure 6 shows various profiles of the dispersion radius rRðxÞ. The dispersion of aerosols is significantly larger with a grid generating turbulence than without. In all cases, Eq. (10) provides an excellent fit to the data within the scatter. It constitutes a very striking result: a model based on a single correlation timescale is sufficient to adequately represent all the data. At short distance x < vT from the source, the dispersion takes place in a cone: rR is linear in x. This controversial regime has been explored in a series of recent papers.3,4,15-20 At large distance x > vT, conversely, the diffusion regime predicted by Taylor with a constant diffusivity is recovered, in which the radius increases as the square root of time, i.e., x here.
From each profile rRðxÞ, two quantities are, therefore, extracted: the turbulent fluctuation rate rV=v and the cross-

over length vT, which is the cross-over distance between the ballistic and diffusive regimes. These quantities are plotted in Fig. 7 as a function of the mean flow velocity u. The fluctuation rate rV=v is independent of the wind velocity u, as expected, and equals to $7:5%. The cross-over length vT is very small when no grid is introduced at the entrance of the wind tunnel. It is much larger with a turbulence generating grid. It tends to a nonzero value as u ! 0 and increases with the fluid velocity u. The Lagrangian correlation length rVT increases from 0:7 to 2:5 cm in the range of velocities explored, which is significantly smaller than the grid mesh size: correlations come from intermediate scale flow structures. The slope of the curve gives a characteristic time around 9 ms, which is much larger than the Stokes time of oil droplets, around 0:3 ms. As shown in the discussion of Eq. (6), this is consistent with the dynamics of particles with negligible inertia. To the best of our knowledge, there is no simple mechanistic explanation to the observed dependence of T with u. This dependence is a near-field effect of the grid, which is why we have used a single decorrelation time, independent of u, to fit the field data of Fig. 2.

The two profiles collapse on the same curve except near the injection nozzle, where oil drops nucleate from their vapor. The nearly constant profile shows that the droplets do not change much in size during convection and dispersion. The variations, equal on both curves, are due to residual heterogeneities of light. This validates the measurement of the concentration field within a multiplicative constant from experimental data.

IV. RELEVANCE FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF THE
AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION RISK OF SARS-COV-2
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted in the airborne route by respiratory aerosols: droplets of mucus, ranging between 200 nm and 200 lm, which can contain viral particles.6,21,22 These droplets are produced in the respiratory tract during normal respiratory activity by various fluid instabilities.23-25 The air exhaled by an infected person contains active SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, which may start an infection when one of the virions is deposited on an ACE2 receptor of the epithelium and successfully bypasses the immune response. Infection may also start if virions deposit on the eyes. The probability of infection increases with the intake viral dose, defined as the amount of virus particles inhaled by a person, cumulated over time. It, therefore, increases with the exposure time and with the concentration of viral particles in the air.26,27
The viral transmission risk by a given infected patient is, therefore, determined by the concentration in viral particles in the air inhaled by another susceptible person. This concentration is given by the rate of emission of viral particles in exhaled air and by the dilution of the air between exhalation and inhalation. In closed rooms, viral particles accumulate, and their concentration eventually reaches a steady state between exhalation and ventilation, which is the replacement of contaminated air by fresh air. This explains the large transmission clusters in poorly ventilated indoor spaces.6 The average transmission risk, uniform in space, can be determined by assuming that viral particles are well-mixed by turbulence. In that case, dilution is due to the natural or forced air exchanges with outside air.26,27 Near an infected person, however, the concentration is much higher and decays with distance, and the dilution from the exhalation concentration of viral particles to the average concentration of viral particles is controlled by the local airflow. The total transmission risk is, therefore, the sum of an average risk, controlled by ventilation, and an additional risk in the dispersion cone of exhalations. Outdoors, in the absence of homogenizing flow, this short-range risk is the only transmission risk. Respiratory activity, such as unmasked coughs and sneezes, can create large airflows that dominate over the pre-existing flow patterns. In that case, air is exhaled in a buoyant jet that gets gradually mixed at its boundaries as it travels.23,25 Face masks strongly alter the airflow by blocking the jet; small jets can remain along the nose and the cheeks if the mask is not properly fitted.28,29 The stopping distance of a masked respiratory puff is around29 20 cm; the more filtering masks make the puff stop earlier. Beyond this very near field distance, dilution is fully controlled by the ambient airflow, which is what we have extensively developed here.
Our analysis applies to any public space where either face mask wearing is mandatory and there is a horizontal air draft or the air velocity is much larger than the exhalation velocity. We have found that in large indoor corridors, the airflow is a horizontal draft with u ¼ 0:1À1 m=s. Outdoors, the wind is also horizontal with larger velocities. Understanding the dilution in these public spaces allows us to assess their transmission risk, given biological data on pathogen contagiousness.26,27 This is needed to ground infection prevention policies on a solid physical basis, as some (such as the "6 ft rule") are not (see Refs. 22 and 30 for a historical perspective and critical discussion). Exhaled CO2 is a commonly used risk proxy in well-mixed rooms;26,27 its spatial decay allows for a simple translation of the short-range risk into an

831

Am. J. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 11, November 2022

equivalent long-range risk. For the gentle draft of shopping mall corridors u ' 0:2 m=s, the increase in risk at 6 ft corresponds to a CO2 concentration excess of 50 ppm.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this article, we have investigated experimentally and theoretically the dispersion of a passive scalar (the concentration of particles) by a turbulent flow. This constitutes an accessible problem to teach turbulence at an undergraduate level, combining possible experiments and theory. Using any source of fog, a fan and a camera, the Reynolds decomposition between average and fluctuating quantities can be illustrated qualitatively and quantitatively. The derivations based on physical reasoning and dimensional analysis remain linear and much simpler than attempting to solve the Navier-Stokes equation. While the Reynolds number dependence of the drag force exerted on a solid is useful to introduce dimensionless numbers, asymptotic regimes, viscosity, and inertial effects, as it is usually done in fluid dynamics textbooks (see, e.g., Ref. 1), the diffusion of a passive scalar provides a way to understand the role of fluctuations to enhance turbulent mixing. The applications to the dispersion of odors and animal olfactory search,31 the dispersion of pollutants, or airborne viral transmission are immediately appealing to students.

Background. Evidence on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during air travel is scarce. We aimed to estimate the attack rate for wild-type SARS-CoV-2 to improve the evidence base for the adaptation of nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies aboard airplanes. Methods. In collaboration with German Public Health Authorities (PHA), we conducted a follow-up of in- ight SARS-CoV-2 contact persons. We included those contact persons whom the Emergency Operations Centre at the Robert KochInstitute had forwarded to PHA between January to March 2020 (before masking on ights became mandatory) and June to August 2020 (after the introduction of mandatory masking). We retrospectively collected data on whether these contact persons had been successfully contacted, had become symptomatic and had been tested for SARS-CoV-2, and whether alternative exposures other than the ight were known. Results. Complete data that allowed for the calculation of attack rates were available for 108 contact persons (median age of 36 (IQR 24-53), 40% female), traveling on 46 ights with a median ight duration of 3 hours (IQR 2-3.5). 62 of these persons travelled after masking on ights became mandatory. 13/87 developed symptoms, 44/77 were tested (no data for 21 and 31). 13 persons (9 of whom had been SARS-CoV-2 positive) were excluded from the analysis of attack rates due to a likely alternative exposure. We thus identi ed 4 probable in- ight transmissions (2 of which occurred after the introduction of mandatory masking). e overall attack rate resulted in 4.2% (4/95; 95% CI: 1.4%-11.0%). Considering ights after mandatory masking, the attack rate was 3.6% (2/56, 95% CI 0.6%-13.4%), before masking 5.1% (2/39, 95% CI 0.9%-18.6%). Conclusions. e risk of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 transmission during air travel seemed low, but not negligible. In order to formulate an e ective, evidence-based NPI protocol for air travel, further studies considering the di erent transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and vaccination status are needed.

1. Background
Since its discovery in December 2019 in China, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread around the globe, accounting for numerous cases and deaths worldwide.
While there are many studies on SARS-CoV-2 attack rates in settings such as households, indoor recreational events, or travel on cruise ships, evidence on the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during commercial flights is still scarce [1-4].
To our knowledge, the current literature on in-flight wild-type SARS-CoV-2 transmission largely consists of reports focusing on one or a few flights where transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested [5-23]. Only 3 studies were published that specifically reported the absence of transmission [12, 14, 21]. is suggests that the current body of evidence might be biased towards events where transmission has been documented, thus pointing to an overestimation of

attack rates among flight contacts. Accordingly, a systematic review concluded that the quality of evidence of most published studies (up to January 2021) investigating in-flight attack rates was low [24]. Of the few systematic studies that have recently been published, none focused on time periods where masking during flights was mandatory [25, 26].
Here, we present the data of a systematic study of 46 flights where an in-flight exposure (i.e., a SARS-CoV-2 positive person during infectious period being on-board) has been documented, including flights where on-board masking was mandatory.
e goal of this study was to describe the attack rate among identified close flight contacts of individuals infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., original Wuhan strain).
is was done through a follow-up on flight-related SARSCoV-2 contacts that were identified as part of the international SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing efforts at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin, Germany.

2. Methods
2.1. Study Design. We conducted a retrospective, crosssectional study of prevalence of acute wild-type SARS-CoV2 infection among close in-flight contact persons.
2.2. Contact Tracing of Flight Contacts at the Robert Koch Institute, Germany. As the national public health institute in Germany, the RKI distributes information between foreign countries and German public health authorities (PHA). For cross-border contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic, the RKI set up a specific international communication and contact tracing team (RKI ICTeam) [27].
Contact information for SARS-CoV-2 contact persons was forwarded through the federal state health authority to the respective PHA where the contact was living or staying at the time. ese local PHAs then proceeded with contact tracing activities (i.e., telephone interview, regular monitoring) in accordance with the German Infection Protection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz; IfSG).
2.2.1. Definition of Contacts. Passengers within 2 rows from the index case were considered as high-risk contacts until 17 March 2020. is practice was based on recommendations of the World Health Organization for SARS-CoV-2 (28, 29). Between 18 March and 14 June, the RKI paused its recommendation to trace flight guests as the first wave hit Germany and PHA needed to prioritize their efforts.
On 15 June 2020, the recommendation on contact tracing of flight guests was resumed: direct seat neighbors were considered as high-risk and other persons within 2 rows as low-risk contacts.
2.2.2. Definition of Primary Cases. A primary case was defined as a person with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had travelled by plane during the infectious period. is period was defined as 2 days before until 14 days after symptom onset for symptomatic individuals and 2 days before until 14 days after laboratory diagnosis for asymptomatic primary cases.
2.2.3. Data Management. e RKI IC-team gave a cluster ID to each reported cross-border COVID-19 exposure event and archived them in a cluster list with access limited to its team members. is cluster list contained all available information relevant for contact tracing of the respective event. For flight-related clusters, these data included flight details, seat information of case/s and contacts, symptoms, date of symptom onset, and positive test result of the index case as well as contact details of close in-flight contacts.
2.3. Retrospective Follow-Up on COVID-19 Status of Contacts Successfully Traced by the German PHA. For this study, we reviewed the aforementioned cluster list to identify any contact persons for follow-up. We included contact persons

for whom sufficient contact information was available and who could be assigned to a German PHA. Contact persons were excluded from follow-up when available information suggested any other exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the 2 weeks prior to the flight. As an example, if it was known that passengers had shared hotels or restaurants or had been part of the same travel group as the index case, these clusters or specific contact persons within the clusters were excluded from follow-up.
In order to receive information on the SARS-CoV-2 status of identified contacts for this study, we contacted the German PHA that had received contact details for further follow-up during the acute event. e authorities were asked to review their records for SARS-CoV-2 related outcomes of the in-flight contacts. We asked whether authorities had been in contact with the identified contact persons, the date of contact, whether the persons had become symptomatic within 14 days after the flight, the type of symptoms, whether and when SARS-CoV-2 testing had been performed, test results as well as whether alternative SARS-CoV-2 exposures other than the flight were known. For this study-related follow-up, personal data were exchanged using an encrypted
exchange server ® (Cryptshare ).
2.3.1. Case Definition for Secondary Cases. Considering a SARS-CoV-2 incubation period of 2-14 days, we defined a probable flight transmission as a PCR-confirmed contact person with symptom onset (or sampling date if symptom dates were missing) within 2-14 days after the flight, without any known alternative exposure to SARS-CoV-2 before or after the flight. When symptom onset or sample collection date occurred 2 days after the flight, the case definition was only met if the primary case was known to be symptomatic on the day of the flight.
2.4. Calculation of the Attack Rate. For the calculation of the in-flight attack rate, we included those contact persons where the PHA could provide documentation that contact tracing had been successful, i.e., the PHA had been in contact with and informed the contact persons about the exposure. Attack rates were calculated by dividing the number of identified secondary cases by all successfully traced contact persons, expressed in percent.
2.5. Time Periods under Study: e effect of Mask-Wearing on Attack Rates. In May 2020, i.e., during the period when contact tracing of flight contacts was paused at RKI, the 1st version of the COVID-19 Aviation Health Safety Protocol was released and masking on-board airplanes became mandatory [28]. For the purpose of this study, we assumed that most passengers did not exercise air travel specific infection control measures (e.g., face mask) until May 2020 but that most if not all did afterwards. Data on the actual use of face masks were not available. In order to evaluate the effects of masking on attack rates, we compared the COVID19 attack rates of all contacts identified before (23 January 2020 to 17 March 2020) vs. those identified after (5 June 2020

to 10 August 2020) masking on-board airplanes had become mandatory. As mentioned above, all flights under the study took place during a time before the surgence of other SARSCoV-2 variants of concern (VOC), most of which differ in their transmissibility from the wild-type, original Wuhan strain under investigation here.
2.6. Ethical Consent and Data Protection. is study was reviewed and approved of by the ethics committee of the Charite´-Universita¨tsmedizin Berlin, Germany (no. EA2/243/ 20). Compliance with the GDPR has been checked by the data protection department of the RKI; the implementation of the study was approved by the institute's management.
2.7. Data Quality Assurance and Statistical Analysis. To ensure data quality, 2 members of the study team independently entered data and validated for 10% of all cluster records selected for follow-up. As continuous variables were not normally distributed, medians and interquartile ranges (±IQR) were calculated. Categorical variables were reported as counts and frequencies. Proportions were compared using Fisher's exact test and chi-square test of independence, for ordinal data Wilcoxon rank sum test was used.
Microsoft Excel was used for data management where manual compilation of information was required. R using RStudio ( e R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, and RStudio, Boston, the United States of America) was used for cleaning, management, and analysis of datasets.
3. Results
A total of 635 contact persons were identified for follow-up. ese persons were distributed over 137 flights and 192
German PHA. PHA provided no feedback for 255 of 635 persons and, for an additional number of 272 persons, the available feedback was insufficient to calculate attack rates. 13 persons (among whom 9 were SARS-CoV-2 positive) were excluded from further analysis due to an alternative source of SARS-CoV-2 exposure as documented by the PHA. A flowchart from inclusion for follow-up until calculation of attack rates is depicted in Figure 1.
us, for the calculation of attack rates, we included 95 persons traveling on 46 flights. Detailed characteristics of all 95 persons, stratified by time periods before and after the introduction of masking, can be found in Table 1. e median age of contact persons and the proportion of symptomatic index cases differed significantly between the two time periods (p  0.01 and p  0.04, respectively). Notably, the median duration from detection of the index case to successful contact tracing reduced by one day between both time periods, possibly indicating an improvement in contact tracing efforts between and within countries.
Among the 95 persons described above, we identified 4 probable in-flight transmissions according to our case definition, 2 of which occurred before masking became mandatory (Table 2). All 4 probable in-flight transmissions were on flights with only one known index case.

e total attack rate amounted to 4.2% (95% CI 1.4%- 11.0%). While the point estimate for the attack rate during the time period after the introduction of masking was slightly lower than before masking, confidence intervals overlapped widely (Table 3).
4. Conclusions
In this study among 95 in-flight contacts seated within two rows from the index case, we identified a total of 4 PCRconfirmed, probable in-flight wild-type SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.
Our results show that wild-type SARS-CoV-2 transmission also occurred during periods when masking onboard was mandatory. Although our results included time periods with and without masking, the low number of events did not allow for a meaningful statistical comparison of attack rates between periods.
To our knowledge, there are only a handful of studies to date that have investigated the in-flight attack rates for wildtype SARS-CoV-2 in a fashion comparable to ours, i.e., using the SARS-CoV-2 exposure (and not the outcome) as trigger for the study and including a large number of flights [22, 23, 25, 26]. is design has the advantage of not being overly biased towards flights where SARS-CoV-2 transmission has already been documented. Furthermore, socalled superspreading events among flight travels can be put into perspective as the calculated attack rates in this design represent the average of all included flights.
A study by Blomquist et al. that investigated flight contacts until March 2020 reported fairly similar attack rates of 3.8% (95% CI 1.3-10.6) among the 79 contact traced passengers sat within a 2-seat radius [25]. e comparable design, definition of cases, and close contacts probably contribute to these results being very similar to our findings [29].
An investigation by Hu et al. across 177 in-country flights departing from Wuhan before the lockdown on 23 January 2020 with a total of 5622 passengers resulted in a total attack rate of 0.6% (95% CI 0.43%-0.84%) [26]. is estimate, significantly lower compared to ours and to the results of Blomquist et al., might result from various reasons. In Wuhan, high-risk contacts included passengers within 3 rows seating distance, thus including 2 additional rows where transmission risk was possibly lower, thereby reducing the overall estimate. Moreover, the authors did not provide information on how many contact persons included for the calculation of attack rates had actually been successfully contact traced and/or tested. is might affect the estimate in at least 2 ways: if contact tracing/testing proportions were low, a significant number of in-flight transmissions might have gone undetected. On the other hand, if contact tracing was (nearly) complete, the estimate by Hu et al. would probably be more accurate and hereby highlight a limitation of our investigation, and that of Blomquist et al., both were retrospective analyses where only a minority of all in-flight contacts were successfully contact traced. Considering this, it is probable that infected contact persons were more likely to be successfully contact traced (e.g., as

they might have sought testing even without the intervention by the PHA). Furthermore, records of COVID-19 cases were possibly more likely to still be available at the PHA when the retrospective data collection was done while those of negatively tested contact persons might already have been deleted. In both scenarios, the overall attack rate in our study would be biased towards higher estimates.
Most other limitations of our study are related to the fact that initial data collection was not done for study purposes but in order to facilitate fast and effective contact tracing. is might have triggered incomplete data on, e.g., symptom status of the index case or seating distance. However, we do not assume that these limitations significantly affected our results, since the local PHA usually validates whether a close contact had actually taken place. Also, although contact persons were often asked about alternative source of infection other than the flight and these persons were subsequently excluded from the analysis, we cannot completely rule out that community transmission might have affected our results.
We would like to point out that our investigation focused on in-flight transmission of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and that conclusions on the attack rates of variants of concern (VOC) should only be made with great caution as most of these VOCs showed a different (and often increased) transmissibility when compared to the original Wuhan strain. To our knowledge, there are no studies that have investigated average attack rates over a greater number of flights for VOCs. In this regard, more research is direly needed.
As to the public health relevance of these findings, we believe that attack rates are one factor to be weighed in when prioritizing contact tracing of flight contacts against other efforts of disease control. us, depending as well on the public health infrastructure and capacities of each country, the decision on to what extent flight contacts are traced should also take other circumstances like the current disease epidemiology in the country of arrival, COVID-19 vaccine coverage and recent emergence of VOCs into consideration.

Abstract
Aim: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has generated over 8 000 000 cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide and has led to the implementation of strict measures in all countries. The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitude and implementation status of personal protective measures (PPMs) by ordinary citizens in Northern Cyprus and their access to personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Subject and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study based on internet-based survey. A total of 406 participants were recruited between May 1 and 4, 2020 via authors' networks to complete a questionnaire. Participants were asked to indicate how often they implemented the five PPMs recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), their daily frequency of hand hygiene events, their COVID-19 knowledge as well as the availability of PPE in their hometown.
Results: The prevalence of the five PPMs ranged from 65.0% to 95.6%, with the highest being hand hygiene and the lowest being avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. Hand hygiene events were recorded to be more than 10 per day in 47.3% of the participants. Gloves (86.2%), surgical masks (52.2%), and cloth face masks (47.3%) were the most commonly used PPE in public areas. The majority of the responders were aware of the incubation time (90.4%) and indirect route of viral transmission (89.7%), whereas knowledge of droplet (72.2%) and aerosol transmission (43.6%) were lower. Knowledge was gained mainly through social media and TV.
Conclusion: Overall, citizens implemented protective measures effectively and were strictly coherent to government-induced curfew and self-isolation measurements with a high public awareness.
Introduction
Originated from Wuhan, China in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged as a significant threat to public health, and has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), with 8 061 550 cases and 440 290 deaths occurring worldwide as of 17th June 2020 (World Health Organization a. 2020). While SARS-CoV-2 was initially observed in East Asia, Europe consequently became the center of the pandemic (World Health Organization b. 2020), followed by United States and Latin America, and is currently adversely affecting multiple African countries.
With the rapid surge in the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, WHO emphasized the urgent need to coordinate international collaborative efforts to minimize the threat in all affected countries in order to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19 (World Health Organization c. 2020). While the battle against COVID-19 is ongoing, multiple measures have been taken by governments in an effort to slow down and mitigate viral transmission of the respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 in the local population such as
Page 2/22

closing down schools, banning public gatherings/events, stopping mass movements via land, sea and airports, imposing partial/full curfew, implementation of the social distance rules and compulsory use of face masks. When formulating a health policy, key front-line workers within multi-disciplinary teams should be a part of the policy planning to ensure that these policies function effectively (Park et al. 2015). Indeed, government health education messages represent a key source of information for citizens for promoting their self-protective practices against respiratory infectious diseases. These preventive messages generally emphasize improved hygiene, face-mask use and social distancing measures, including avoiding crowds during epidemics (World Health Organization. 2009; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2010; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. 2020). Although the decision-making and application of such measures by governmental bodies is essential for the control of a pandemic, the level of awareness and adherence of citizens to control measures is also crucial for the successful application of the aforementioned measures.
In the absence of an effective vaccine, public implementation of PPMs is fundamental. WHO has recommended five main PPMs against COVID-19: hand hygiene, social distancing measures, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, practice of respiratory hygiene and self-isolation (World Health Organization d. 2020). Another recommendation by WHO also suggests that citizens should follow advice given by their healthcare provider or their national and local public health authorities in order to obtain information from a reliable source. The level of public adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 and it directly impacts the trajectory of the outbreak in a country. This is particularly valid during outbreaks which, due to their evolving nature and inherent scientific uncertainties, can be associated with considerable fear in the general public, especially if illness or death rates are high (Person et al. 2004). This was a phenomenon observed during the SARS outbreak in 2003, where studies conducted suggest that the level of panic emotions in the population is directly associated with their knowledge and attitudes towards the infectious disease (Hung 2003).
In order to facilitate outbreak management of COVID-19 in Northern Cyprus, there is an urgent need to clarify the public's awareness of COVID-19 and their status of implementation of the protective measures, as well as their access to personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to investigate the knowledge, attitude and practices of Cypriot citizens towards COVID-19, and measure their coherence to PPMs during the public health crisis.

Subjects And Methods
Participants and data collection

Page 3/22

This was a cross-sectional study conducted through an internet-based survey between 1st May and 4th May, 2020. The survey ended on 4th May 2020, which corresponds to the date on which COVID-19 related partial curfew from 06:00 to 21:00 ended in Northern Cyprus, in order to have reliable data on selfisolation and coherence to curfew measurements. As of 1st May, the total number of reported COVID-19 cases in Northern Cyprus was 108 (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ministry of Health 2020). A total of 406 citizens were included in this study. Participants were recruited via authors' networks with local citizens living in Northern Cyprus. A recruitment poster with a link to questionnaire was posted to online pages with local COVID-19 related media as well as Facebook, emails and WhatsApp, which contained information on the background, objective, voluntary nature of participation, indications how to fill in the questionnaire as well as the declarations of anonymity and confidentiality of participants. No ethical approval was required for this survey.
Measurement
Assessment of sociodemographic characteristics
The first part of the questionnaire consisted of the assessment of sociodemographic attributes in which participants responded to demographic variables including gender, age, education status, occupation, current district of residency, smoking (smoker/non-smoker), chronic disease (present/non-present) and seasonal influenza vaccination history (vaccinated/non-vaccinated).
Assessment of knowledge on COVID-19
Participants were asked to answer questions regarding the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 among choices including droplet, aerosol and indirect transmission (touching contaminated surfaces and then touching eyes, mouth and nose) routes or indicate if they did not know the transmission route of infection. Participants also responded to a question on the incubation period for SARS-CoV-2. Among the
Page 4/22

choices 1-2 days, 2-4 days, 2-14 days, 27 days and "I do not know the incubation period" option were present.
Assessment of WHO recommended personal protective control measures
Participants were asked to indicate which of the personal protective control measures including hand hygiene, social distance, avoiding touching nose, mouth and eyes, and use of face mask they implemented during the pandemic and the frequency of implementation for each measure. For each option, the scale was designed as always, sometimes, rarely and never. Participants also responded to a question which assessed their coherence to the curfew imposed by the local government, outside of their working hours, with a scale of always, generally, rarely, and never.
The application of personal protective equipment by ordinary citizens was evaluated. Individuals were asked to indicate which PPE they used in public areas such as supermarkets, with choices including gloves, surgical masks, vented masks, cloth masks, wrap/scarf, face shield, goggles, and "I do not use any PPE". Participants were also assessed if they applied hand hygiene before and after PPE use, and if they adhered to social-distancing rules while wearing face masks.
Assessment of hand hygiene events per day
Questions were designed to evaluate the hand hygiene measures applied by citizens. Individuals were initially asked which products they use when they apply hand hygiene and selected from various options including water, soap and water, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, pure alcohol, cologne with at least 70% alcohol content, wet tissues or "I do not use any products". The number of hand hygiene events per day was also evaluated. Participants reported the mean number hand hygiene events based on soap and water and alcohol-based hand sanitizers per day. Assessment of the availability of personal protective equipment during the pandemic
Page 5/22

As the use of PPE and application of hand sanitation can be affected by their availability in a local town or city, participants were asked to report their access to these products during the pandemic. Participants responded to questions for the availability of masks, gloves and hand sanitizers with a scale of always, generally, rarely and never for each product.
Assessment of the attitude towards healthcare facilities during the pandemic
The citizens were asked if, during the pandemic, they felt any reservation from visiting hospitals or any healthcare facility where they responded as yes or no. Additionally, participants were asked if they would go for a COVID-19 test in a mobile test center in a hospital carpark without leaving their car for which they responded as yes or no.
Assessment on the source of COVID-19 related information
In this survey, the use of reliable source of personal protective procedures as well as the source of COVID19 related updates by participants were evaluated. Individuals were asked to choose among World Health Organization, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ministry of Health, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Medical Association, newspapers, TV and social media for the most commonly used source of personal protective procedures. Citizens also indicated the most commonly used sources of COVID-19 related updates among scientific articles, TV, radio, internet sites, newspapers, brochures/flyers, social media, family/friends/relatives and WhatsApp group.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 23 (IBM, Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Knowledge and attitudes and practices of different individuals according to demographic characteristics were compared with independent samples t test or Chi-square test as appropriate. Binary linear regression analysis using demographic variables as independent variables and knowledge or
Page 6/22

practices as the outcome variable was conducted to identify factors associated with attitudes and practices. P value 0.05 or less was considered significant.
Results
A total of 406 participants completed the survey questionnaire. The demographic characteristics of participants are shown in Table 1. Of all the responders, 47% were males and 53% were females. The distribution of age range was 2% in the 15-20 age group, 37.2% in the 21-34 age group, 24.4% in 35-44 age group, 9.4% in 45-54 age group, 21.2% in the 55-64 age group and 5.9% in the 65+ age group. The highest number of participants were residents of Nicosia (51.5%), followed by Kyrenia (17.5%), Famagusta (15.5%), Lefka (6.4%), Morphou (4.9%) and Trikomo (3.9%). A large majority of the participants had a Bachelor's degree (49.8%) or higher (24.9%), while 17.7% had high school, 5.4% had secondary school and 2.2% had primary school education. Of all the responders, 71.4% were nonsmokers, while 28.6% were smokers. In terms of chronic disease, 16.7% answered `Yes' and 83.3% answered `No', whereas only 6.4% of the individuals received the seasonal flu vaccination.
Before assessment of the implementation of PPMs by citizens, participants were asked two questions regarding the transmission routes and incubation time of COVID-19 in order to measure their level of knowledge of the disease, which may also affect their inclination to properly apply protective measures and PPE use. A striking 89.7% of the individuals responded with indirect transmission route for the disease, whereas 72.2% and 43.6% were aware of droplet transmission and aerosol transmission routes, respectively (Fig. 1a). A small proportion, 1.2% of the citizens responded "I do not know" for the disease transmission question. Regarding the incubation time for COVID-19, 90.4% was aware of the 2-14 days of incubation time, and the rest of the individuals either answered "I do not know" or responded with a wrong choice of incubation time (Fig. 1b). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that education levels of individuals and COVID-19 incubation time knowledge were not significantly associated (P=0.917), suggesting that individuals at all education levels were knowledgeable about COVID-19 and that this knowledge was gained through educatory channels during the pandemic.
Fig. 2a shows the prevalence of the application of WHO recommended PPMs against COVID-19 by the citizens. In terms of hand hygiene, 96.5% of the participants responded to always implement the measure during the pandemic. Social distancing was always implemented by 82.6% of the responders, while 15.6% and 1.8% responded to sometimes and rarely apply social distancing measures in public areas, respectively. Alternatively, 72.6% and 65.8% always implemented the use of face masks and avoided touching the nose, mouth and eyes, respectively. Among all PPMs, hand washing was statistically the most applied measure (P=0.001). In terms of PPE use, %86.2 of the citizens responded to use gloves, 2.0% to use googles, and 0.7% to use face shield while in public areas such as supermarkets. When face masks are considered, %52.2 responded to use surgical masks, 47.3% to use cloth masks, 7.6% to use
Page 7/22

vented masks and 2.0% to use wrap or scarf to cover their mouth and nose while in public areas. Types of PPE used by participants and their usage prevalence is shown in Fig. 2b.
Of all the participants, 90.1% indicated to apply hand hygiene before and after mask and glove use, and 93.8% indicated to practice 2-meter social distancing while in public while using masks. Citizens were also asked how often they adhered to curfew imposed by the local government. A large proportion, 79.5% were always and 19.5% were usually coherent to the curfew, whereas a total of 1% of the individuals rarely or never adhered to the imposed curfew (Table 2).
When participants were asked to indicate which hand hygiene products they used, 95.6% responded to use soap and water, 81% to use hand sanitizer, %69 to use cologne with at least 70% alcohol content, 38.4% to use absolute alcohol and 37.4% to use wet wipes. However, 4.7% used only water and none of the responders indicated not to use any hand hygiene product (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b and c show the total number of hand hygiene events per day. For hand washing, the majority of participants, 47.3% washed their hands more than 10 times a day, followed by 7-10 times with 33.5%, 4-6 times with 16.3% and 1-3 times with 2.7% (Fig. 3b). For hand sanitation events, the majority of citizens, 37.9%, applied hand sanitizer 1-3 times a day, followed by 4-6 times by 28.8%, 7-10 times by 13.5% and 8.6% of the participants never applied hand sanitizer (Fig. 3c). There was a statistically significant difference between age groups and hand washing frequency (P=0.046), where individuals in age group 35-54 had a higher hand washing frequency (7 or more) compared with other groups. On the contrary, there was no statistically significant difference between age groups and frequency of hand sanitation application (P=0.159).
When the local availability of PPE for the participants was assessed, only 20.5%, 26.8% and 26.8% responded to always have access to masks, gloves and hand sanitizer available, respectively. A large majority of participants responded to usually find masks (49.5%), gloves (52.0%), and hand sanitizer (51.2%) available. However, although less than 25%, some of the participants were rarely or never able to find these PPE products available at the pharmacies or supermarkets during the pandemic (Fig. 4).
Majority of citizens (82%) indicated that, during the pandemic, they felt reservation from visiting hospitals or healthcare facilities. Additionally, %84.2 of the participants responded that they would be comfortable with going for a COVID-19 test in a mobile test center in a hospital carpark without leaving their car. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that education levels of individuals and having a COVID-19 test in a mobile test center were not significantly associated (P=0.266), suggesting that individuals at all education levels were comfortable with having a COVID-19 test in a mobile test center.

Based on the responses as the source of COVID-19 related information, 71.4% of the participants indicated to use social media, 70.9% to use TV and 68.5% to use internet websites. Less than 20% of the citizens used newspapers, scientific articles, brochures/flyers, radio, family/friends/relatives and WhatsApp groups as source of COVID-19 information. Among the responders, the majority followed personal protective procedures via social media (73.6%), TV (55.2%) or newspapers (5.2%), while the reliable sources such as World Health Organization, T.R.N.C Ministry of Health and T.R.N.C Medical Association ranged as 42.9%, 48.0% and 25.1%, respectively (Table 3).
Discussion
In the course of a pandemic, the implementation of PPMs represents an important factor for the control of the outbreak and has been shown to have significant protective effects associated (Saunders-Hastings et al. 2017). This study was designed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and implementation status of PPMs by the citizens in Northern Cyprus between 1 May and 4 May 2020. The survey period covers an important time period amid COVID-19 pandemic in which all preventive measures enforced by the local government in Northern Cyprus was in place and the curfew was still ongoing, and therefore provides a timely assessment. Overall, 70-90% of the individuals surveyed were knowledgeable about the droplet and indirect transmission routes of disease transmission, whereas the citizens were aware of the more recently described aerosol route of transmission (van Doremalen et al. 2020) at a lesser extent, approximately 44%. The survey responders also demonstrated a 90% knowledge of the incubation period for COVID-19, demonstrating a high comprehension of disease characteristics during the pandemic. Recent surveys on public knowledge on COVID-19 in China, where the pandemic has emerged, demonstrated an overall 90% correct rate on a COVID-19 knowledge test which included questions on main clinical symptoms, viral transmission, observation period and age groups affected (Zhong et al. 2020). In a separate study, where the responders were asked question regarding the origin, common signs and symptoms, sources of infection of COVID-19 and awareness of any other pandemic viral infection, the knowledge level of individuals varied according to profession (Khan et al. 2020).
WHO and its recommendation of five PPMs against COVID-19, namely hand hygiene, social distancing measures, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, use of face masks, and self-isolation, has been taken as a reference by all countries and was communicated to the citizens via local health authorities in each country. Of these measures, the prevalence of hand hygiene and social distancing were the highest

and respiratory etiquette was high, whereas the prevalence of avoiding touching nose, mouth and eyes was the lowest among Northern Cyprus citizens. Compared with a recent a study conducted in Japan, with hand hygiene being the highest with 83.8% and the lowest being avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with 59.8%, the prevalence of PPM application was overall higher in Northern Cyprus (Machida et al. 2020). Similarly, in a population survey performed in the United Kingdom in the age group of 18+ individuals, the prevalence of respondents taking the aforementioned measures to protect themselves and others from COVID-19 were comparably much lower with face mask implementation being as low as 3% and hand washing being highest with 83% (Atchison et al. 2020). Alternatively, in a study conducted in Hong Kong, enhanced personal hygiene practices were adopted by more than 77% of citizens.
The recommendation on the use of face masks by citizens in public areas has been controversial. In a guidance report dated 29 January 2020, the WHO recommendation was for only individuals with respiratory symptoms to wear a medical mask to avoid unnecessary cost, procurement burden and false sense of security (World Health Organization e. 2020). WHO, additionally published interim guidance report on the rational use of PPE for COVID-19 which recommended the use of vented masks (respirators) only for frontline healthcare workers in order to optimize the PPE availability (World Health Organization f. 2020). However, health authorities in parts of Asia encouraged all citizens to wear masks in public setting, and the Czech Republic applied mandatory use of face masks to prevent viral spread in the community (Servick 2020). The Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) has also recommended the use of cloth face coverings or cloth masks in public settings with particular risk of community-based transmission (Centers for Disease Prevention and Control. 2020). In Northern Cyprus, the mandatory use of face masks was implemented by the local government on 24th April 2020. In the Cypriot community, the practice of surgical mask and cloths mask use was 47-52% and approximately 8% for vented masks, indicating a good adherence to government measures against COVID-19 with some room for improvement.
During the early phase of the pandemic, a major demand of face masks, gloves and hygiene products arose mainly due to the panic caused by the outbreak and it has led to the exhaustion of local hygiene products and personal protective equipment as well as a steep rise in prices in many countries (Chaib 2020). In Northern Cyprus, the shortage of gloves, face masks and hand sanitizers were reported by 2130% of the citizen, who indicated they could never find certain PPE types available. In terms of the source of information used by people to gather knowledge about COVID-19, some studies suggested that social media and internet is among the most commonly used sources (Abdelhafiz et al. 2020; Atchison et al. 2020), whereas people also had a tendency of acquiring information and advice from TV and local health authorities which they expressed as more reliable (Kwok et al. 2020). The Cypriot citizens' choice of COVID-19 information and advice on PPMs were similar to previous studies with TV, social media and

Conclusion
In conclusion, the knowledge of the disease characteristics and the practice of PPMs and coherence to government induced protective measures was high in Cyprus citizens. This is believed to have advantageous effects on the control of the outbreak in the country where no new cases of COVID-19 has been reported since 17th April 2020 (AA Media. 2020).

The novel Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020, impacting the lifestyles, economy, physical and mental health of individuals globally. This study aimed to test the model triggered by physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection, in which the need for health information and perceived impact of the pandemic mediated the path sequentially, leading to adverse mental health outcomes. A cross-sectional research design with chain mediation model involving 4612 participants from participating 8 countries selected via a respondent-driven sampling strategy was used. Participants completed online questionnaires on physical symptoms, the need for health information, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The results showed that Poland and the Philippines were the two countries with the highest levels of anxiety, depression and stress; conversely, Vietnam had the lowest mean scores in these areas. Chain mediation model showed the need for health information, and the perceived impact of the pandemic were sequential mediators between physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection (predictor) and consequent mental health status (outcome). Excessive and contradictory health information might increase the perceived impact of the pandemic. Rapid COVID-19 testing should be implemented to minimize the psychological

burden associated with physical symptoms, whilst public mental health interventions could target adverse mental outcomes associated with the pandemic.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. As of December 4 2020, the number of confirmed cases was 65,528,133, the number of death cases was 1,511,726 and the number of recovered cases was 45,371,073 w­ orldwide1. While one may not necessarily contract COVID-19 during this time, certainly, his or her mental health is likely affected due to financial ­burden2, occupational injury due to potential risk of ­infection3 as well as the loss of livelihoods and ­opportunities4. The COVID-19 pandemic has become an urgent issue on global mental health and an unprecedented challenge for healthcare systems of all ­countries5. Emerging psychological disorders and mental health has been identified as the tenth leading research topic during the COVID-19 p­ andemic6.
A study of the early-stage COVID-19 pandemic in China found anxiety in 6.33% and depression in 17.17% of 600 ­respondents7. In other Asian countries, a new questionnaire, i.e., the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, was developed in ­Iran8, but this questionnaire did not measure other psychiatric symptoms such as depression. In Pakistan, mental illness poses a significant challenge to its under-resourced health care s­ ystem9. In Italy, the healthcare system stretched to its limit because healthcare workers constituted10% of Italy's confirmed COVID-19 c­ ases10 As a result, recent guidelines recommended all healthcare workers should receive psychological support based on coping strategies for managing ­stress11. In Europe, the levels of psychiatric symptoms were generally low at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, younger Spanish individuals with chronic diseases reported more symptoms than the rest of the ­population12. In the United States (US), Asian Americans were less likely to report psychiatric symptoms than Caucasian Americans during the COVID-19 p­ andemic13. Studies from China, Italy, Germany and Russia identified protective and risk person factors for mental health during COVID-19. Risk factors for adverse mental health include younger a­ ge14, especially young people who had to work outside their ­domicile15, reduced ­income14, family member infected by COVID-1915, having chronic ­diseases14, concerns related to COVID-19 infection for themselves or family m­ embers14, living a­ lone14, having family c­ onflicts14. Protective factors for mental health include disseminating reliable ­information16 and personal confidence by mastering knowledge of the p­ andemic17.
Researchers observed that mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety were affected by the ­pandemic18, but the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. Several behavioral theories could be applied to identify factors that influence mental health during the pandemic. One health behavior theory is the protection motivation theory developed by R.W. Rogers in 1­ 97519. According to this theory, the COVID-19 pandemic might trigger the threat-appraisal and coping-appraisal p­ rocesses19. The public would experience uncertainty and become very concerned about physical symptoms, which resemble COVID-19 infection. Due to the potential threat and impact of the pandemic, they would become worried that they did not have enough health information to protect themselves. For the coping-appraisal process, a person would search for health information to enhance understanding of the pandemic and take measures to reduce the risk of developing an i­nfection20. The information-buffer hypothesis suggests that health information could buffer against physical symptom threats, thus reducing anxiety, depression, and stress. On the contrary, the overload of health information, especially inaccurate and misleading information, might lead to adverse mental health outcomes. Recently, Amanzio et al. (2020) proposed a theoretical framework to explain the association between health information, the psychological impact of a pandemic, physical symptoms and mental health outcomes based on the nocebo phenomenon for the infectious ­disease21. During the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicting and inaccurate health information (e.g., contradictory advice on face mask use) could lead to negative thinking and ­expectation22, resulting in the nocebo ­effect21, which ultimately lead to adverse mental health ­outcomes23. In summary, the physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection would trigger the need to search for health information, affecting the perceived impact of the pandemic and ultimately adverse mental health outcomes (i.e., anxiety, depression and stress).
To address the above research gaps, this study aimed to compare the mental health outcomes in the general population of 8 countries (China, Pakistan, Philippines, Iran, Poland, Spain, the US, Vietnam) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on existing theoretical perspectives, we constructed a chain mediation model to test the following hypothesis (see Fig. 1): (a) the physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection would be

Results Demographics of participants. There were 4612 participants from 8 countries (866 from China, 982
from Poland, 619 from the Philippines, 651 from Spain, 571 from the US, 391 from Iran, 419 from Pakistan, and 113 from Vietnam) who took part in the Global Mental Health Survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. Supplementary Table 1 compares the demographics of 8 countries. More than half of the participants were women in all countries (United States: 52.9% to 79.0% in Spain) except Pakistan. More than half of Chinese participants were below the age of 31 years. More than half of the Spanish participants were above the age of 41 years. The majority of Chinese, Iranian, Vietnamese and Polish respondents were married, while most Filipino respondents were single. More than 70% of participants have a university degree.
Comparison of mental health outcomes among 8 countries. Figure 2 compares the IES-R and DASS-21 scores among all countries. China (mean=32.54, SD=0.52), Iran (mean=31.61, SD=0.82) and Poland (mean=31.18, SD=0.43) were the three countries with highest IES-R scores. There were significant differences in IES-R scores among 8 countries ( F(7, 4604)=61.79, 2=0.086, p<0.001). Pakistan (mean=14.41, SD=0.56),

Poland (mean=13.98, SD=0.32) and Spain (mean=13.93, SD=0.39) were the three countries with highest DASS-21 stress scores. There were significant differences in DASS-21 stress scores among 8 countries (F(7, 4599)=62.41, 2=0.087, p<0.001). Pakistan (mean=8.81, SD=0.48), Iran (mean=7.83, SD=0.47) and Poland (mean=7.45, SD=0.25) were the three countries with highest DASS-21 anxiety scores. There were significant differences in DASS-21 anxiety scores among 8 countries (F(7, 4603 )=14.71, 2=0.022, p<0.001). Pakistan (mean=11.70, SD=0.56), Poland (mean=9.73, SD=0.28) and Spain (mean=8.39, SD=0.34) were the three countries with highest DASS-21 depression scores. There were significant differences in DASS-21 depression scores among 8 countries (F(7, 4604)=26.00, 2=0.038, p<0.001). Vietnam has the lowest IES-R (mean=17.82, SD=1.31), stress (mean=3.24, SD=0.55), anxiety (mean=2.09, SD=0.47) and depression (mean=2.23, SD=0.52) scores. The LSD analysis showed that the scores of Vietnam were significantly lower than each of the other countries (p<0.05).
Physical symptoms resembling COVID19 and need for health information. Supplementary Table 2 shows the frequency of physical symptoms that resemble COVID-19 infection. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the most common physical symptoms reported by the participants in 8 countries were headache (28.62%), cough (20.73%) and sore throat (19.7%). The least frequent physical symptoms were breathing difficulties (11.56%), rigors or chills (11.27%) and fever (10.99%). The prevalence of other physical symptoms was coryza (19.32%), myalgia (16.37%), dizziness (15.26%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) (16.97%). Supplementary Table 3 shows the health information needs of participants from 8 countries. The top three information needs include understanding the effectiveness of drugs and vaccines available (70.22%), need for advice regarding treatment methods (64.36%) and information about local outbreaks (62.3%). Chinese participants reported the highest percentage for health information needs (>90%).
Correlation of subscales. The mean average score per item for each subscale and correlations of sub-scales are displayed in Table 1. All the subscales were significantly correlated (p<0.01) except for the need for health information with DASS-21 stress and depression subscales (p>0.05). Physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection were positively and significantly associated with the perceived psychological impact of the pandemic as well as DASS-21 stress, anxiety and depression scores (p<0.01). The need for health information was positively and significantly associated with the perceived psychological impact of the pandemic, DASS-21 anxiety score and physical symptoms (p<0.01).

have a significant and positive association with the need for health information (p<0.001). In the second step, both physical symptoms and the need for health information were observed to show a significant and positive association with the perceived impact of the pandemic (p<0.001). In the third step, mediation analysis was performed to assess the association between physical symptoms, the need for health information, the perceived impact of the pandemic and mental health outcomes. For anxiety, physical symptoms, the need for health information and the perceived impact of the pandemic were significantly and positively associated with anxiety (p<0.001). For depression, physical symptoms, the need for health information and the perceived impact of the pandemic were significantly and positively associated with depression (p<0.001). For stress, physical symptoms, the need for health information and the perceived impact of the pandemic were significantly and positively associated with stress (p<0.001).
Table 3 shows the chain mediating effect of the need for health information and the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between physical symptoms and various mental health outcomes. For anxiety, the chain mediating effect of the need for health information and perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between physical symptoms and anxiety was significant (effect=0.004, 95% CI=0.002-0.007). For depression, the chain mediating effect of the need for health information and perceived impact of the pandemic between physical symptoms and depression was significant (effect=0.003, 95% CI=0.001-0.006). For stress, the chain mediating effect of the need for health information and perceived impact of the pandemic between physical symptoms and depression was significant (effect=0.003, 95% CI=0.001-0.005).
Figure 3a showed the chain mediating effect of the need for health information, and the sequential chain mediating effect for the need for health information and the perceived impact of the COVID pandemic in the association between physical symptoms and anxiety. All the paths in this model were significant (p<0.001) except that the association between the need for health information and anxiety (B=0.01, p>0.05). Figure 3b showed the chain mediating effect of the need for health information, and the sequential chain mediating effect for the need for health information and the perceived impact of the COVID pandemic in the association between physical symptoms and depression. All the paths in this model were significant (p<0.001) except that the association between the need for health information and depression (B=- 0.004, p>0.05). Figure 3c showed the chain mediating effect of the need for health information, and the sequential chain mediating effect for the need for health information and the perceived impact of the COVID pandemic in the association between physical symptoms and stress. All the paths in this model were significant (p<0.001) except that the association between the need for health information and stress (B= - 0.01, p>0.05). For the three adverse mental health outcomes, the need for health information, when considered alone, did not act as a mediator.
Discussion
The objective of this study was to compare the levels of DASS-21 scores and to rest the association between physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection and adverse mental health outcomes, as well as the mechanisms accountable for this association in multi-national populations across Asia, Europe and North America.

mediation showed that the need for health information explained partly of this mediation process. Although the need for health information did not act as a mediator when considered alone, there was a sequential mediating effect in which physical symptoms was associated with the need for health information, which in turn associated with higher perceived impact of the pandemic, which in turn associated with adverse mental health outcomes (i.e., anxiety, depression and stress).
Based on research conducted before the pandemic, the normative data for DASS-21 are as follows: the mean depression score was 3.87, the mean anxiety score was 2.95, and the mean stress score was 4.8724. In this study, the mean DASS-21 scores of all countries were higher than normative data except Vietnam. For IES-R, the means IES-R scores reported by healthy citizens after witnessing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was 20.17.25. In this study, the mean IES-R scores of Chinese, Spanish, Polish, Iranian, American and Pakistani respondents were higher than healthy citizens witnessing CPR except for Filipino and Vietnamese. We observed that Pakistan and Poland were the two countries with the highest DASS-21 subscale scores. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Happiness Report ranked the countries that had the greatest improvement of happiness from 2005-2008 to 2016-2018 as follows: Philippines (+0.860), Pakistan (+0.703), Poland (+0.445) and China (+0.426)26. In contrast, United States (- 0.446), Iran (- 0.713) and Spain (- 0.793) showed reduction in happiness scores from 2005-2008 to 2016-201826. The COVID-19 pandemic might reverse the increase in happiness scores in Poland and Pakistan. Each country faced unique challenges during the pandemic. Respondents from Poland reported high DASS-21 stress, anxiety and depression scores. A recent Polish study found that loneliness was correlated with psychiatric symptoms and emotional response to physical health threat during the COVID-19 p­ andemic27. Furthermore, increased worry about the social isolation and concerns for financial problems was observed in lonelier ­Poles27. Additionally, the Polish media frequently reported that the healthcare system in Poland was not prepared to fight the pandemic, having to deal with staff shortages, deficit in medicine supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) for health personnel or hospital closures, which may have had an impact on the mental health of the P­ oles28. Pakistani respondents reported high levels of DASS-21 stress, anxiety and depression scores, which may be related to perceptions of an incomplete response to COVID-19 due to poor sanitation, lack of basic preventive measures, lack of proper testing and medical f­acilities28. Pakistani health professionals started protesting and threatened to quit work due to a lack of P­ PE28. The unpreparedness and contradictory policies resulted in an alarmingly high COVID-19 spread and worsening mental health of Pakistani people, although data collected on mental health was during the peak time of the COVID-19 spread in the country. Chinese respondents reported the highest IES-R scores. China was the first country to report COVID-19, but the Chinese people were also accused of not being transparent about the COVID-19 and spreading the virus across the ­world29. The editor-in-chief of The Lancet, Richard Horton expressed concern about discrimination or revenge actions toward China and C­ hinese30. Iran ranked second in terms of high IES-R and DASS-21 anxiety scores. The economic sanctions that prevented medical supplies, equipment and drugs from arriving in ­Iran31 could lead to anxiety among Iranians during the pandemic.
In this study, Vietnamese respondents were found to have the lowest DASS-21 and IES-R scores. Coincidentally, news reports identified Vietnam as one of the best countries in adopting multiples effective measures that have been key to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic to d­ ate32. Effective measures include dissemination of health ­information33, engagement of grassroots healthcare s­ ystem34 and village health c­ ollaborators34, as well as safeguarding the health of ­workforce35 to ensure minimal impact on the economy.
The current study is the first to demonstrate the mediation mechanism underlying the association between physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection and mental health outcomes. Based on the chain mediation model, physical symptoms were positively associated with higher anxiety, depression and stress. This result adds to previous studies that have suggested that real or perceived infection threats could lead to negative psychological ­reactions36, and people's anxieties were closely related to physical ­symptoms37. Experiencing physical symptoms that resemble COVID-19 infection could trigger ­hypochondriasis38, and a higher number of physical symptoms experienced could lead to strong disease ­conviction39. As a result, rapid diagnostic test development and implementation are crucial to alleviating adverse mental health outcomes when a person experiences physical symptoms similar to COVID-19 ­infection40. The uncertainty of potential threat during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic could trigger anxieties, depression and stress much more than f­ear38. The current study also identified the role of health information as a mediator in the link between physical symptoms and the perceived impact of the pandemic. During the strict lockdown, people were refrained from social ­interaction41 and spent more time at home and searching for health information online. Consistent with the protection motivation ­theory19, the need to search for more health information is triggered by activity in survival circuits that detects imminent threats of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the need for health information was not associated with adverse mental health outcomes, which might partially support the information-buffer hypothesis. The need for health information formed a sequential mediation path with the perceived impact of the pandemic on mental health outcomes. This finding is consistent with previous research about information-induced behavioral changes during the COVID-19 l­ockdowns42. Excessive health information might heighten the perceived impact of the pandemic through cyberchondria that is defined as the unfounded escalation of concerns about COVID-19 symptoms based on a review of search results and literature ­online43. According to the nocebo ­phenomenon21, conflicting health information (e.g., confused face mask policy)22, unproven conspiracy t­ heories44 and ­rumors45 also enhanced the negative impact of the pandemic. In contrast, people who were likely to less frequently accessed health information were less anxious, depressed and stressed, and worried about the p­ andemic46. Our findings confirmed the second path of the indirect effect: that physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection was associated with a higher level perceived impact of the pandemic and led to adverse mental health outcomes. This finding is consistent with previous research that symptoms of emerging infectious diseases might lead to stigma and adverse mental health o­ utcomes47. In summary, the current study provided evidence that the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with the need for health information which was rooted in the physical

symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection. Physical symptoms were associated with adverse mental health outcomes with sequential mediation by the need for health information and perceived impact of the pandemic.
The findings of this first multi-national study have several implications on public mental health strategies. Firstly, Kaslow et al. (2020) proposed that community mental health strategies include providing support groups, participating in health education outreach and disseminating mental wellness ­guides48. Furthermore, mental health professionals should offer online psychological interventions such as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based therapy to improve the general population's mental h­ ealth49. The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to introduce and promote telepsychiatry that overcomes the quarantine measures and geographical distance for mental health ­assistance50. Second, as physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection (e.g., headache, chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, coryza) were associated with adverse mental health outcomes, the lack of testing for coronavirus could worsen mental health. There is an urgent need to develop accurate, rapid diagnostic tests in general practitioners' clinics, community and rural ­settings51. For low income countries, coronavirus testing should be easily accessible and free. A negative COVID-19 test result for members of the general population who present with physical symptoms may alleviate anxiety, depression and stress. Third, based on our findings, the WHO, governments and health authorities should provide regular updates on health information including effectiveness of prevention strategies, therapeutics, and vaccines and treatment methods. The study results could contribute reference information to various countries that need to monitor public mental health status and provide accurate and consistent health information during the ­pandemic37.
Limitations. This study has several limitations. The first limitation was that the study population had different sociodemographic characteristics as compared to the world population. The respondent sampling method also compromised the representativeness of samples. The study population was female predominant (proportion of female in the study population: 68.55%; world population: 49.58%)52 and a high proportion of the study population possessed a university degree (proportion of degree holders in the study population: 70%; world population: 7%)53. The second limitation was sampling and selection bias because we could not reach out to potential respondents without Internet access in both countries. There was an uneven number of participants among 8 countries because 1938 Vietnamese participants were excluded due to incomplete questionnaires, and a smaller number of Iranian participants were recruited due to lack of Internet access in some areas of Iran. The third limitation was the cross-sectional nature of this study. Although the chain mediation model contributes to our understanding of the mediational factors that might influence the association between physical symptoms and adverse mental health outcomes, it cannot verify the temporal relationship. A longitudinal study is required to verify the direction of the paths further. The fourth limitation was that we did not record demographic data regarding the pre-existing mental illness of the study participants. The fifth limitation was that self-reported psychological impact levels, anxiety, depression and stress may not always be aligned with objective assessment by mental health professionals. Nevertheless, the perceived impact, anxiety, depression and stress are based on personal feelings, and self-reporting was paramount during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sixth limitation was that we could not confirm whether participants were seropositive to COVID-19 at the time of the survey because it was an online questionnaire-based study. Another possible limitation was the different recruitment periods of participants for each country and we planned to study the impact of COVID-19 during the peak periods that varied from country to country. Lastly, we were unable to calculate the response rate. For potential respondents who were not keen to participate in the online survey, no response was recorded, and we could not collect any information from them.
In conclusion, this multi-national study across three continents results provides empirical evidence that COVID-19 affected mental health worldwide. We found that Poland and Pakistan were two countries with the highest mean scores in IES-R and DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress scales. In contrast, Vietnam had the lowest mean scores in IES-R and DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress scales. The chain mediation model shows that the need for health information and the perceived impact of the pandemic exert sequential mediating effects on mental health outcomes in people who experience physical symptoms that resemble COVID-19 infection. It is hoped that these results will be public health values in formulating mental health strategies for the pandemic.
Materials and methods Participants and questionnaires. The recruitment period for each country is listed as follows: China
(February 28 to March 1, 2020), Philippines (March 28 to April 7, 2020), Spain (April 14 to 18, 2020), Iran (March 24 to 26, 2020), United States (April 21 to April 29, 2020), Pakistan (April 21 to July 6, 2020), Vietnam (April 7 to 14 2020) and Poland (March 22 to March 26, 2020). This study was approved by the institutional review boards of Complutense University of Madrid (Spain) (Protocol Number: IRB (Pr_2019_20_027), East Carolina University (The US) (Protocol Number: UMCIRB 20-000838), Hanoi Medical University (Vietnam) (Protocol Number: QD 75/QD-YHDP&YHDP), Huaibei Normal University (China) (Protocol Number: HBUIRB-2020-002), Islamic Azad University (Iran) (Protocol Number: IRB-2020-001), University of Karachi (Pakistan) (Protocol Number: ICP-1 (101) 2698), the University of Philippines Manila (Protocol Number: UPMREB 2020-198-01) and the SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities (Poland) (Protocol Number: WKEB62/04/2020). This study was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and the ethical principles in the Belmont Report. All participants were above the age of 18 years and provided informed consent prior to participation of this study.
This study used a theory-based questionnaire, the National University of Singapore (NUS) COVID-19 questionnaire, designed to examine the relationship between physical symptoms resembling COVID-19, health information required, the psychological impact of COVID-19 and mental health parameters. Its psychometric properties were established in the initial phase and peak of the COVID-19 ­epidemic54,55. The NUS COVID-19

questionnaire consisted of 3 subscales: (1) demographic data; (2) physical symptoms related to COVID-19 in the past 14 days, and (3) health information required for the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic data about age, gender, education, household size, marital status, parental status and residential city in the past 14 days were collected. Physical symptoms related to COVID-19 included cough, fever, gastrointestinal and other symptoms. Respondents also rated their physical health status and stated their history of chronic medical illness. The health information required for the COVID-19 pandemic includes symptoms related to COVID-19, prevention and treatment advice, need for a regular update, knowledge in local transmission, the effectiveness of drugs and vaccines, travel advice, transmission methods and other countries' responses. The internal consistency of subscales on physical symptoms and the need for health information was examined using Cronbach alpha coefficients. Cronbach's alpha>0.6 was considered acceptable reliability based on a previous theory-based q­ uestionnaire56. The Cronbach's alpha for physical symptoms and the need for health information subscales were 0.63 and 0.95, respectively.
The psychological impact of COVID-19 was measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The IES-R is a self-administered questionnaire that has been well-validated in the American, European and Asian populations for determining the extent of psychological impact after exposure to a traumatic event (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic) within one week of e­ xposure57-60. This 22-item questionnaire is composed of three subscales, aiming to measure the mean avoidance, intrusion and ­hyperarousal61. The total IES-R score is divided into 0-23 (normal), 24 - 32 (mild psychological impact), 33-36 (moderate psychological impact) and>37 (severe psychological impact)62. For the regression analysis, the cut-off score for high and low psychological impact was 24. In this study, the Cronbach's alpha for the different versions of IES-R are as follows: China: 0.949, Iran: 0.912, Pakistan: 0.95, Poland: 0.883, Philippines: 0.912, Spain: 0.948, the US: 0.959 and Vietnam: 0.92.
The mental health status of respondents was measured using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS21) and calculation of scores was based on a previous ­study63. DASS-21 has been used to assess mental health in ­American64, ­Asian65,66 and E­ uropean67 populations. The internal consistency of DASS-21 stress, anxiety and depression scales was measured by the Cronbach's alpha. In this study, the Cronbach's alpha for different versions of DASS-21 is as follows: China: stress: 0.888, anxiety: 0.845, depression: 0.878; Iran: stress: 0.934, anxiety: 0.891, depression: 0.94; Pakistan: stress: 0.923, anxiety: 0.914, depression: 0.923; Philippines: stress: 0.839, anxiety: 0.784, depression: 0.889; Poland: stress: 0.890, anxiety: 0.854, depression: 0.886; Spain: stress: 0.895, anxiety: 0.876, depression: 0.89; The US: stress: 0.921, anxiety: 0.914, depression: 0.938 and Vietnam: stress: 0.864, anxiety: 0.866, depression: 0.904. For the regression analysis, the cut-off score for high stress score group was35; the low stress score group was10; high anxiety group was20; low anxiety group was6; high depression group was28 and low depression group was9. IES-R and DASS-21 were previously used in research related to the COVID-19 ­epidemic54,58,68,69..
Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated to compare demographic characteristics, physical symptoms and health service utilization, contact history, knowledge and concern, precautionary measure and additional health information variables among 8 countries. One-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared the mean IES-R and DASS-21 scores between 8 countries to determine whether the associated population mean IES-R or DASS-21 scores were significantly different. If there were significant differences among 8 countries, the Least Significant Difference (LSD) would calculate the smallest significance between mean scores of two countries with different combinations. Any difference larger than the LSD is considered a significant result. We used Pearson's correlation to calculate the correlation coefficients between physical symptoms, the need for health information, and the perceived impact of COVID-19 pandemic and adverse mental health outcomes. Then we followed a stepwise method to construct the best fitting model for the mediated effects of the need for health information and the perceived impact of the pandemic. Mediation analyses were conducted by a regression-based macro for SPSS version 21.070. In addition, a bootstrapping procedure with 2000 replications was run to test the chain mediation model. The significance levels of direct and indirect effects among the four factors (i.e., physical symptoms, health information requirement, the psychological impact of events and mental health parameters) and chain mediating effect would be determined. All tests were two-tailed, with a significance level of p<0.05. Statistical analysis was performed on SPSS Statistic 21.0.

Abstract We obtained 24 air samples in 8 general wards temporarily converted into negative-pressure wards admitting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) omicron variant BA.2.2 in Hong Kong. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 19 (79.2%) of 24 samples despite enhanced indoor air dilution. It is difficult to prevent airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals. (Received 1 August 2022; accepted 24 September 2022)

Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) omicron variant in November 2021, it became the dominant variant circulating globally. The evolving SARS-CoV-2 omicron sublineages from (BA.1 to BA.2 to BA.4 to BA.5) have demonstrated progressively increased transmissibility,1 leading to explosive outbreaks in the community.2 Whether the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant increased the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in the healthcare setting remains uncertain. Recent studies have shown that the universal use of surgical respirators as a component in infection prevention contributed to the rapid control of SARS-CoV-2 omicron transmission in the hospital.3 Universal use of surgical respirators in the healthcare setting was also advocated when the infection rate of COVID-19 in community was high.4 The preliminary findings of surgical respirator use in the SARS-CoV-2 omicron era may provide an indirect implication of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant in the clinical areas.

Demonstration of air dispersal of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant may further support the use of surgical respirators by healthcare workers (HCWs) in general wards. Based on our previous experience in performing air sampling to detect SARSCoV-2 RNA in the airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) of hospitals and community treatment facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic,5-7 we performed air sampling to assess the air dispersal of SARS-CoV-2 in general wards that were temporarily converted into negative-pressure wards (NPWs) for COVID-19 patients during the surge of SARS-CoV-2 omicron cases in the fifth wave of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. These findings may have implications for infection control.
Methods
Collection of air samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wards
To assess the air dispersal of SARS-CoV-2, air samples were collected in Queen Mary Hospital using an AerosolSense Sampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) as previously described.6,8 The air sample was collected through an omnidirectional inlet and directed toward the collection substrate through an accelerating slit impactor at a flow rate of 200 L per minute for a total of 1-6 hours, resulting in 12,000 L to 72,000 L of air per sample. The air sampler was placed outside the nursing station, which was located at the center of the ward (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. Floor plan of a negative-pressure ward for COVID-19 patients. This is a general ward in Queen Mary Hospital, a 1,700-bed university-affiliated hospital, to be temporarily converted into negative-pressure ward caring for COVID-19 patients. The ward has an open cubicle design with ceiling height of 2.2 m. In the original design, the air supply was vented to each patient cubicle and the air exhaust was located in the corridor. During the conversion process, the air exhaust in the corridor was closed. With the installation of mobile modular high efficiency particulate arrestance filter units (MMHUs) and exhaust fans in each cubicle, negative pressure was established and the direction of airflow was demonstrated from the cubicle to window by engineers at the time of testing and commissioning. The air changes per hour increased from 6 to at least 10 for enhancing indoor air dilution. The air sampler was placed outside the nursing counter, which was located at the center of the ward.

Viral load assessment of air samples and respiratory specimens
The collection substrate of each air sample was immersed in 2 mL viral transport medium, and 1 mL medium was used for total nucleic acid extraction using the eMAG extraction system (bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as previously described.5 For clinical specimens, total nucleic acid extraction was performed using 250 L of the specimen and was subjected to RT-PCR as described above.
Whole-genome sequencing of respiratory specimens
Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and determination of viral lineage were performed using the Oxford Nanopore MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and Nanopore protocol, that is, the PCR tiling of COVID-19 (version PTC_9096_v109_ revH_06Feb2020), respectively, as we described previously.2 This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Hospital Cluster.
Statistical analysis
Univariate analysis and multiple linear regression were used where appropriate. All reported P values were 2-sided. A P value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. Computation was performed using SPSS version 15.0 software for Windows (IBM, Armonk, NY).

Results
Analysis of air samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wards
For this study, 24 air samples were collected in 8 NPWs (Supplementary Table online). The median number of patients in each NPW was 19 (range, 8-37) at the time of air sampling. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected at a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 39.1±2.3 in 19 (79.2%) of 24 air samples. Univariate analysis revealed that detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air samples was significantly associated with more COVID-19 patients in the ward, lower mean Ct value of clinical specimens, longer duration of air sampling, and timing of air sampling. Multivariable analysis with multiple linear regression showed that the duration of air sampling was negatively correlated with the Ct value of air samples (B = -0.929; P = .006) (Table 1).
Analysis of WGS of respiratory specimens
Of 495 RT-PCR-positive respiratory specimens collected from COVID-19 patients in 8 NPWs, 41 (8.3%) were randomly selected for WGS, of which 3 (6.7%) of 45 specimens were collected from ward A2, 7 (10.1%) of 69 from ward B2, 2 (3.5%) of 57 from ward B3, 6 (15.4%) of 39 from ward D4, 10 (15.4%) of 65 from ward D6, 6 (7.0%) of 86 from ward E4, 3 (2.9%) of 102 from E6, and 4 (12.5%) of 32 from ward K13N. All sequences were identified to be SARS-CoV-2 omicron sublineage BA.2.2.
Discussion
We have consistently demonstrated the phenomenon of air dispersal of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in almost 80% of air samples collected in the NPWs caring for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 omicron

Note. COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; Ct, cycle threshold; NA, not applicable; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SD, standard deviation. aStudent t test was used for 2-group comparison of continuous variables. bVariables that were considered as statistically significant in univariate analysis were subjected to multivariable analysis using multiple linear regression to determine whether there is any
correlation between Ct value of air samples and each variable. Any negative air samples were assigned with a Ct value of 45 for statistical analysis. cClinical sample of COVID-19 patients included deep throat saliva, combined nasal and throat swab, or nasopharyngeal swab. dTiming of air sampling was defined as day of air sampling counting from the start of the study.

sublineage BA.2.2 during the fifth wave of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the air samples were significantly associated with more COVID-19 patients in wards, patients with higher viral load using Ct value as surrogate, and longer duration of air sampling by univariate analysis. These are reasonable findings because more COVID-19 patients in the ward with higher viral load would result in exhalation of more virusladen aerosol. However, viral load in our air samples was low, probably because of the installation of mobile modular high efficiency particulate arrestance filter units (MMHUs) and exhaust fans in the windows to improve the indoor air dilution (Fig. 1).
The finding of SARS-CoV-2 dispersal in the NPWs may have an impact on hospital infection control, especially in general wards or other clinical areas where the indoor air dilution is not as good as AIIRs or NPWs. Asymptomatic COVID-19 patients may spread the virus in these areas via airborne route, which may result in outbreaks. Prolonged exposure to COVI9-19 patients may have an increased risk of infection. This factor was indirectly implied in our multivariable analysis in which the duration of air sampling was negatively correlated with the Ct value of air samples. The use of surgical respirators by HCWs may protect them from acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 and may minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 dispersal from infected HCWs. However, discomfort would increase over time with continual respirator use at work,9 making universal use of surgical respirator not practical, especially during a nonoutbreak period. In addition, it is impossible to eliminate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 dispersal from infected patients. Although surgical masks can be provided to all patients, compliance may not be 100%.10 The MMHUs cannot be installed at all wards because of its large size. Enhancement of indoor air dilution by installation of MMHUs could not eliminate the virus, as shown in our study. Therefore, it is difficult to prevent airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals. Promulgation of COVID-19 vaccination is the key to protect patients and HCWs from developing severe infection when transitioning from the pandemic to endemicity.

This study had several limitations. We did not perform WGS for the air samples due to low viral load. However, the WGS of our hospitalized patients confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 omicron sublineage BA.2.2, which was also the predominant sublineage during the fifth wave of COVID-19 in Hong Kong.2 We did not report the details of COVID-19 transmission in wards. Given the finding of air dispersal of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 would be possible. We did not perform virus isolation for the air samples. The low level of RNA detected may not directly translate to an infective dose. Nevertheless, our results provide an alert to support continued vigilance against nosocomial airborne transmission of COVID-19.

Abstract
The covid-19 vaccine confers direct protection and reduces transmission rates of the virus and new variants. Vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and CoronaVac have been cleared for children in Brazil. They are safe, effective, and immunogenic. There are no known complications associated with the use of steroids or vaccines in pediatric patients with covid-19 and nephrotic syndrome. With or without immunosuppression, these patients are not at increased risk of severe covid-19, and steroids are safe for them. A milder form of covid-19 occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease without the need for hospitalization. The vaccine response may be reduced and/or the duration of antibodies after vaccination may be shorter than in the general population. However, considering risk of exposure, vaccination against covid-19 is recommended. It is believed that patients with hemolytic-uremic syndrome are at higher risk of severe covid-19. Vaccination is recommended, although specific data on the safety and efficacy of the covid-19 vaccine are limited. There is agreement that the benefits of induced immunity outweigh the risks of immunization. Vaccination against covid-19 is recommended for children and adolescents needing kidney transplantation or who have undergone transplantation. These patients present decreased immune response after vaccination, but immunization is recommended because the benefits outweigh the risks of vaccination. Current recommendations in Brazil stipulate the use of the messenger RNA vaccine. This paper aims to provide pediatric nephrologists with the latest knowledge about vaccination against covid-19 for children with kidney disease.

Resumo
A vacina covid-19 confere proteção direta, reduz as taxas de transmissão do vírus e de novas variantes. No Brasil, estão liberadas para a população pediátrica as vacinas Pfizer/BioNTech e a CoronaVac, ambas seguras, eficazes e imunogênicas. Pacientes pediátricos com síndrome nefrótica e covid-19 têm curso clínico regular sem complicações relacionadas ao uso de esteroides ou vacinas. Esses pacientes, com ou sem imunossupressão, não apresentam maior risco de covid-19 grave e o tratamento com esteroides é seguro. Os pacientes com doença renal crônica têm covid-19 mais leve, sem necessidade de hospitalização. A resposta vacinal pode ser reduzida e/ou a duração dos anticorpos pós-vacinação pode ser menor do que na população geral. Entretanto, a vacina covid-19 está recomendada, considerando o risco de exposição. Acredita-se que pacientes com síndrome hemolítico-urêmica teriam maior risco de covid-19 grave. A vacina é recomendada, embora dados específicos sobre segurança e eficácia da vacina covid-19 sejam limitados. Há concordância que os benefícios da imunidade induzida superam quaisquer riscos da imunização. A vacina covid-19 é recomendada para crianças e adolescentes candidatos ao transplante renal ou já transplantados. Esses pacientes têm resposta imunológica reduzida após a vacina, entretanto ela é recomendada porque os benefícios superam qualquer risco dessa vacinação. A recomendação atual no Brasil é a vacina de tecnologia RNA mensageiro. O objetivo deste documento é levar aos nefrologistas pediátricos os conhecimentos mais recentes sobre a vacinação contra contra-19 em crianças com doenças renais.

Vaccination against covid-19: kidney disease and immunosuppressant therapy

Introduction
Covid-19 was first detected in December 2019 in Hubei (Wuhan) province, China. The virus has spread rapidly around the world, and by March 2022, 29 million cases of covid-19 and 652,000 deaths from the disease had been confirmed in Brazil1. In that same period, 6,531 cases of pediatric severe acute respiratory syndrome due to covid-19 and 1,503 cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children with 93 deaths had been confirmed2,3.
A large proportion of children with covid-19 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, and the presence of comorbid conditions is considered a risk factor. A Brazilian study showed that 41% of children admitted to intensive care units had comorbid conditions4.
There are few reports on the risk of severe disease from covid-19 in immunocompromised pediatric patients. Population studies have shown that children and adolescents are exposed to the virus in a similar way to adults and are potential vectors in disease transmission5.
The covid-19 vaccine confers direct protection, reduces the rates of virus transmission and the emergence of new variants6. Lv et al. have demonstrated the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of these vaccines in healthy pediatric populations. Adverse events are rare and mild, and benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks7.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines (BNT162b2), authorized for children aged five years and older, and CoronaVac, authorized for children aged six years and older, are currently approved in Brazil. CoronaVac (Sinovac) is a vaccine with inactivated virus. The Pfizer-BioNTech covid-19 (BNT162b2) vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle of nucleoside-modified mRNA that enables the expression of SARS-CoV-2 protein S on the cell surface. It causes the activation of cytotoxic and helper T-cells and induction of humoral immunity, thereby producing neutralizing antibodies. Both vaccines are safe, effective, and immunogenic.
The most common adverse events in children and adolescents are injection site pain, fever, headache, and fatigue. Most of these events were not serious and deaths have not been reported7. Rare cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis have been reported in association with the administration of the second dose of the covid-19 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine after

a short interval from the first dose (< 30 days), but no deaths have been attributed to these complications7.
Chart 1 shows the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the recommendations for the vaccination against covid-19 for each category of pediatric patients with kidney disease.
Covid-19 and Covid-19 Vaccination in Children and Adolescents with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS)
Most children with idiopathic NS relapse or are steroid-dependent, and require chronic use of immunosuppressants. Urinary loss of endogenous antibodies during NS decompensation and immunosuppressant therapy increase the risk of infections8. Evidence points to immune system dysregulation involving B and T cells as part of the pathophysiology of NS, suggesting that vaccines may promote disease recurrence via the induction of immune response.
To date, there have been few reports of NS associated with covid-19 infection. A systematic review about covid-19 in patients with NS concluded that, with or without immunosuppressant therapy, patients were not at increased risk of severe covid-19, steroid treatment was safe, and the incidence of disease recurrence remained unchanged9. On the other hand, a study performed in New Delhi showed that patients with decompensated NS had a sixfold risk of developing severe complications during covid-19, such as severe acute kidney injury, shock, respiratory failure, encephalopathy, or death10. Cases of NS from minimal injuries triggered after vaccination against covid-19 involving adults and one adolescent have been reported8,11. Recommendations for vaccination are mostly based on expert opinions, considering the lack of controlled studies.
Immunosuppressant therapy for children and adolescents during the pandemic9
I) Continue ongoing treatment, advising parents to report SARS-CoV-2 infection or related symptoms.
II) Initiate or intensify immunosuppressant therapy as needed, without concerns related to covid-19.
III) These patients do not require more stringent protective measures compared to their healthy peers.

Covid-19 infection in children and adolescents with NS
I) For children with covid-19 in remission, treatment must be the same as the one given to healthy children and preventive hospitalization is not needed. Signs of recurrence must be monitored and, in cases of severe disease, hospitalization and reduction of immunosuppressant therapy must be considered.
II) In cases of mild or asymptomatic infection, maintain ongoing treatment with immuno­ suppressants; immediate hospitalization should be avoided. Monitor for signs of recurrence.
NS recurrence in children and adolescents
I) Recurrent disease is treated with corticosteroids; there is no reason to delay the initiation of therapy.
II) For covid-19-related recurrent disease, the usual protocol must be enforced.

Recommendations regarding covid-19 vaccines for children and adolescents with NS
I) Vaccinate all patients with NS, following the age limits established by regulatory agencies.
II) Signs of recurrence must be monitored after vaccination;
III) Vaccines must not be administered to individuals with recurring disease.
IV) Every immunosuppressed patient over the age of 12 must have the third dose of the vaccine and receive the fourth dose four months later.
V) In the case of ongoing anti-CD20 therapy (rituximab), vaccination must be postponed for at least six months after treatment cessation.
Covid-19 Vaccines for Children and Adolescents with NS on Rituximab The response to vaccination in patients taking rituximab is reduced. Thus, properly timing the

administration of vaccines is necessary. Extending the interval between doses or discontinuing rituximab infusions allows immature B-cells to recover and proper vaccine response while levels of memory (pathogenic) B-cells remain low. An alternative strategy is to vaccinate patients at least four weeks prior to rituximab infusion or 12 to 20 weeks after the end of the infusion cycle. Monitoring the effect of rituximab from CD19 lymphocyte levels allows the discontinuation of the drug in asymptomatic and selected patients, which allows the definition of the time needed to improve response to vaccination. Rituximab infusions can be resumed four weeks after completing the vaccination scheme12,13.
Covid-19 and Vaccination Against Covid-19 in Children and Adolescents with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis
There are few studies about covid-19 in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and on dialysis (peritoneal dialysis, PD, or hemodialysis, HD). These studies report the occurrence of milder disease and no need for hospitalization13,14. On the other hand, Aimen et al. found that CKD was the most common comorbid condition in symptomatic children and adolescents. One of the three deaths reported in their study involved a patient on PD15. In Brazil, one of the countries with the highest number of deaths by covid-19 in the pediatric age group, there is no specific data about patients on dialysis.
The usual vaccination schedule is recommended for children and adolescents, with special attention to vaccines with attenuated virus, which are contraindicated after renal transplantation. Vaccine response in CKD patients may be reduced and/or antibodies may be active for shorter periods of time than in the general population16. Nonetheless, given the risk of exposure, vaccination against covid-19 is recommended. It is also important that family members of dialysis patients get the full vaccination regimen, especially those with children under five years of age.
There is no evidence regarding the efficacy of covid-19 vaccines in pediatric patients on dialysis. In the Netherlands, the RECOVAC consortium (REnal patients COvid-19 VACcination), a prospective cohort study including dialysis patients older than 18 years, was organized to evaluate the efficacy of

covid-19 vaccines in patients with CKD stages 4 and 5 and after kidney transplantation, comparing them with unvaccinated controls17.
Zitt et al. evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 vaccine in HD patients. They found local reactions in 38% after the first dose, while 29.2% had mild reactions after the second dose (2.1% moderate; 2.1% serious adverse events). Systemic events occurred rarely, and the most frequent were diarrhea (4% mild; 4% moderate) and fatigue (8% mild). After the first dose, 42% developed adequate vaccine response as assessed by IgG levels against anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein18. After the second dose, seroconversion was observed in 97.2% and was correlated with prior hepatitis B seroconversion and age (younger patients). Patients who had local reactions tended to have higher levels of protective antibodies. Conversely, patients on immunosuppressants during the study had lower levels of protective antibodies18.
Shashar et al. discussed the administration of the third dose in individuals on HD. The authors observed that the group that received the booster, compared to controls, had higher levels of protective antibodies, despite being older and having a greater incidence of hypertension. Serologic response was inversely associated with levels of inflammation markers and malnutrition. A drop in protective antibodies levels was observed eight months after vaccination in the group that did not receive booster shots19. This observation contributed to the discussion of the need for a third dose in individuals on HD20. AngelKorman et al. confirmed this need, while others have wondered whether vaccination of individuals on HD should be considered on an individual basis21,22.
Based on study findings, some medical societies have presented specific recommendations for pediatric patients on dialysis. The British Association for Pediatric Nephrology (BAPN) recommends that covid-19 booster be given only to adolescents with CKD older than 12 years23. The EUDIAL working group of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association (2021) stated that adult patients and children alike should be vaccinated against covid-1924.
Covid-19 infection in children and adolescents with CKD and on dialysis
I) Use the same treatment given to healthy children without the need for preventive hospitalization.

II) In case of mild or asymptomatic infection, maintain treatment; immediate hospitalization should be avoided.

Recommendations to vaccinate children and adolescents with CKD and on dialysis against covid-19

I) Vaccinate all pediatric patients with CKD and on dialysis, following the age limits set by regulatory agencies.

II) Vaccinate preferably with an mRNA vaccine, in accordance with age restrictions.

III) Family members of patients on dialysis and with CKD must comply with the complete vaccination scheme, especially those with children under the age of five years.

IV) All immunosuppressed patients over 12 years of age must take the third dose of the vaccine and the fourth dose four months later.

Covid-19 and Covid-19 Vaccination in Children and Adolescents with Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (aHUS)
aHUS is a microangiopathic disorder whose pathophysiology overlaps with the cytokine storm observed in severe covid-1925. This shared pathophysiology suggests that patients with aHUS are at increased risk of developing severe covid-19, regardless of the status of the treatment for aHUS, including individuals previously diagnosed with covid-1926. The recommendation is that these patients are immunized against covid-1927,28. Although specific safety and efficacy data on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is limited, there is agreement that the benefits of induced immunity outweigh the risks tied to immunization29. In Brazil, the use of live inactive virus vaccines (CoronaVac/Sinovac) has not been authorized for immunosuppressed patients27. Since aHUS is a serious condition, it has been excluded from the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccine trials. Thus, it is unclear whether currently available vaccines are as effective for these patients as they were for the studied populations30,31. There is no data to suggest that the available vaccines are less effective or less safe for individuals with aHUS than for the general population.

Covid-19 infection in children and adolescents with aHUS
I) Maintain treatment; no need for preventive hospitalization. In case of severe infection, consider hospitalization and discontinuation of treatment.
II) In cases of mild or asymptomatic infection, maintain treatment; immediate hospitalization should be avoided.
Recommendations for covid-19 vaccination in children and adolescents with aHUS
I) Vaccinate all pediatric patients with aHUS, following the age limits set by regulatory agencies.
II) Children and adolescents with a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of vaccine or to one of its components should not be vaccinated31.
III) Family members of patients diagnosed with aHUS must comply with the full vaccination scheme, especially family members of children aged less than five years.
IV) In case of comorbid conditions, vaccination must be postponed in individuals with severe acute fever or acute infection.
V) In case of mild infection and/or low fever, do not postpone vaccination.
VI) In patients with thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders, the vaccine must be administered with caution as in other intramuscular injections, with risk of local hematoma.
Patients on eculizumab should be vaccinated as close as possible to the day of drug infusion (days before or days after) because of the theoretical possibility that such approach might reduce the chance of disease exacerbation related to vaccine administration29.
Covid-19 vaccines can be given concurrently or at any time before or after any other indicated vaccine29. This is a change from the previous recommendation, which called for a 14-day interval before or after receiving a covid-19 vaccine. The basis for this change in recommendation stems from general administrative guidance for vaccines and guidance from the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)28.

Vaccination against covid-19: kidney disease and immunosuppressant therapy

Covid-19 and Covid-19 Vaccination in Children and Adolescents Undvergoing Kidney Transplantation
The covid-19 pandemic has negatively impacted pediatric transplantation in Brazil and affected areas such as outpatient care, monitoring, transdisciplinary care, medication, patient/family education/support, schooling, employment, and care of pediatric kidney transplant patients diagnosed with covid-19.
Vaccination against covid-19 is recommended for all individuals, including children and adolescents waiting for kidney transplantation or transplant patients, as authorized by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health32. In suspected or confirmed cases, vaccination must not be performed during the quarantine period27,33. In Brazil, the current recommendation is to use the Comirnaty (PfizerBioNTech) messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine for immunosuppressed patients with an ideal interval of eight weeks between the first and second doses, in individuals aged 5 to 17 years27.
The covid-19 vaccine causes reduced immune response in solid organ transplant recipients when compared to immunocompetent individuals34. Studies in adult recipients have shown that vaccination led to a reduction of almost 80% in the incidence of symptomatic covid-19 compared to unvaccinated recipients35. Unfortunately, studies in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients are limited. Qin et al. showed that 73% of pediatric patients had a positive antibody response after two doses of mRNA vaccine36. Experience with other vaccines has shown that they continue to provide substantial protection against infections and more severe disease in this vulnerable population and should be recommended before and after transplantation35. Considering this experience, covid-19 vaccination for all solid organ recipients is recommended37,38.
Covid-19 infection in pediatric kidney transplant recipients
I) Maintain the same treatment given to healthy children, with no need for preventive hospitalization. In case of severe covid-19 infection, consider hospitalization.
II) In case of mild or asymptomatic infection, maintain treatment; hospitalization should be avoided.

Recommendations vaccinating children and adolescents undergoing kidney transplantation against covid-19
I) Vaccinate all pediatric kidney transplant patients, following the age limits set by regulatory agencies.
II) Use preferably an mRNA vaccine, following age restrictions.
III) Family members of renal transplant patients must comply with the full vaccination scheme, especially family members of children aged less than five years39.
IV) In suspected or confirmed cases, do not vaccinate during the quarantine period;
V) Kidney transplant recipients should receive any of the available covid-19 vaccines based on age and eligibility criteria.
VI) The optimal time to begin vaccination or complete the vaccination scheme after transplantation is unclear. Experts recommend waiting at least one month after transplantation to allow for a more robust immune response.
VII) All immunosuppressed patients over the age of 12 must have the third dose of the vaccine and the fourth dose four months later.
VIII) Contraindications to the mRNA vaccine for solid organ recipients are the same as the general population: · Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or to any of the excipients of the vaccine. · Confirmed anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of a covid-19 vaccine.
IX) Postpone vaccination in individuals with severe acute fever or acute infection. Mild infection and/or low-grade fever should NOT cause postponement of vaccination.
X) In patients with thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders, administer the vaccine with caution, as with other intramuscular injections, with risk of local hematoma;
XI) Do not postpone kidney transplantation for kidney transplant candidates. They can receive the vaccine and do not need to wait for the procedure.

Vaccination against covid-19: kidney disease and immunosuppressant therapy

XII) After transplant, the interval to start or complete the vaccination scheme is 30 days.
XIII) Do not change the immunosuppressants in use; postpone vaccination if the patient has acute fever.
XIV) After vaccination, wear face masks, practice social distancing, and clean hands frequently.
Final Considerations
Covid-19 causes mild symptoms or is asymptomatic in the majority of pediatric patients with CKD, on immunosuppressants due to glomerular disease, or undergoing renal transplantation.
In this group of individuals, vaccination against covid-19 is very important, since it confers direct protection and prevention against the disease. Vaccines reduce virus transmission rates and the emergence of new variants. Adverse events are rare and mild, and the benefits outweigh the risks.
Immunocompromised patients may not develop sufficient immune response after two doses of the vaccine. Studies recommend additional vaccines to improve response. Acceptance of the covid-19 vaccine is necessary to limit the risk that the disease poses to patients40.

ABSTRACT
Background: The risk of possible cross-reactions between serological tests, together with the clinical similarities between dengue fever and COVID-19, can delay diagnosis and increase the risk of both COVID-19 transmission and worsening. The present study aimed to determine the possibility of cross-reactions among rapid serological tests based on clinical symptoms.
Methods: Patients with COVID-19, confirmed by RT-PCR and clinical criteria for diagnosing dengue, were recruited consecutively between September 2020 and August 2021 and underwent rapid immunochromatographic diagnostic (RID) tests for AgNS1, IgM, and IgG. Patients who tested positive for acute-phase dengue IgM and AgNS1 underwent a follow-up test after 12-30 days for diagnostic confirmation.
Results: A total of 43 patients were included, 38 of whom required hospital admission, and 8 received intensive care. Seven patients tested positive on the RID tests, comprising 2 NS1 positive (coinfection), one reactive for IgM and IgG (coinfection), three reactive for IgM not confirmed (false-positive), and one reactive for IgG due to previous infection. Two of the 3 patients with coinfection died. Fever, myalgia, headache, and cough were the most common clinical symptoms, while lymphopenia was the most prevalent laboratory finding.
Conclusions: Cross-reactivity was found in only three patients and coinfection in another three patients, two of whom died of severe COVID-19 manifestations.
Keywords: Dengue. COVID-19. Coinfection. Cross-reaction.

INTRODUCTION
Dengue and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are major public health problems in Brazil and are acute febrile diseases with a variety of similar clinical presentations that can progress to clinically severe forms1-3.
Rapid immunochromatographic diagnostic (RID) tests are important tools for early diagnosis of dengue and allow more adequate management of patients with acute febrile syndrome1. Despite the high specificity and sensitivity of the rapid test for dengue

virus (DENV)4, different countries have reported cross-reactivity of dengue antibodies using RID tests among COVID-19 patients5,6.
The description of two cases of COVID-19 misdiagnosed as dengue in Singapore7 and a suspected case of dengue in Thailand with COVID-19 transmission8 sounded an alert regarding the possibility of serological cross-reactivity between the two viruses and its consequences. This led to a study carried out by an Israeli research group that found a false-positive reaction rate of approximately 22% between dengue and COVID-19, based on the results of IgM/IgG RID tests9. This cross-reaction may be explained

by the similarity between the HR2 domain of the SAR-CoV2 spike protein and the E protein of DENV identified in an in-silico study9.
Many other countries have also reported cases of dengue and COVID-19 coinfection, some of which showed a worse evolution10,11. Dengue is diagnosed based on clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data. RID tests provide determinations of NS1 (viral antigen) and IgM and IgG antibodies and are widely used by emergency services for the diagnosis of dengue. The sensitivity of these tests depends on the time since symptom onset1.
In diagnosing COVID-19, besides clinical and radiological evidence, nasal/oral swab samples are used for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antigen tests3. RT-PCR offers high sensitivity and specificity, but yields results in approximately 24 h3,12. Antigen tests tend to yield faster results but provide lower sensitivity than RT-PCR3,12.
The possibility of cross-reaction of infection by the novel coronavirus with serological tests for dengue is a concern in countries where the two viruses coexist5,13 because, in addition to the possible impact on patient health, there is a risk of delay in adopting the measures needed to prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In view of this risk, the objective of the present study was to follow up on patients presenting to the hospital with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and symptoms resembling dengue and to investigate the possibility of coinfection and cross-reactivity with dengue RID tests.
METHODS
Study type, population, and setting
A prospective observational case series study was conducted to assess the signs and symptoms suggestive of dengue in patients with confirmed COVID-19 and to determine the specificity of acute-phase serological tests for dengue IgM and NS1 in patients with confirmed COVID-19.
The study protocol was approved by the ethics review boards of two private hospitals in the city of Maringá (Paraná State) and by the Research Ethics Committee of the State University of Maringá under CAAE no. 36501620.5.0000.0104, permit no. 4.226.639, on the 20th of August 2020. The study population included patients treated at the emergency department and/ or admitted to adult intensive care units (ICUs) and/or adult infirmary wards diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 using nasal/oral swab samples during the period from September 2020 to August 2021. Patients were selected by convenience sampling based on the signs and symptoms presented. The physician responsible for the admission of the patient was informed, and there was no influence on the therapeutic management of the patient.
The inclusion criteria were patients older than 18 years, admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed via RT-PCR assay, in association with diagnostic clinical criteria for dengue (fever for up to 7 days and at least two of the following signs and symptoms: headache/retro-orbital pain, nausea/vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, exanthem, petechiae, or leukopenia). The exclusion criteria were individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 via serology and/or clinical/ epidemiological criteria with a history of dengue vaccination or prior dengue infection in the preceding 6 months.

Procedure
Cases of COVID-19 were confirmed via real-time RT-PCR tests performed at laboratories approved by the National Ministry of Health. Serum samples were collected for rapid diagnostic (RID) testing using the OnSite Dengue IgM/IgG (CTK Biotech, San Diego, CA, USA) and OnSite Ag kits, and for detection of NS1 (Antigen CTK Biotech, San Diego, CA, USA). Lateral flow immunochromatography was carried out at the Núcleo Diagnóstico laboratory.
Patients who tested positive on the acute-phase dengue test (AgNS1 or IgM) underwent follow-up serological collection 12-30 days after the first test. Data on anthropometric and clinical characteristics of the patients were collected and registered in charts (containing the following information: date of admission, date of symptom onset, date of hospital discharge, sex, age, race, presence of comorbidities, prior dengue infection, and dengue vaccination history. Patients were probed for the presence, on admission or prior to admission, of the following clinical variables: clinically measured or reported fever, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, exanthem, cough, expectoration, coryza, nasal congestion, sore throat, respiratory distress, chest pain, and shortness of breath.
The following data were collected from laboratory examinations on the admission day: hematocrit, hemoglobin level, total leukocyte count, total lymphocyte count, platelets, oxygen saturation assessed via percutaneous (pulse) oximetry in ambient air, aspartate aminotransferase level, alanine aminotransferase level, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level. The secondary outcomes were the need for ICU admission, length of ICU stay, progression to mechanical ventilation, and duration of mechanical ventilation.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive analyses of anthropometric, clinical, and laboratory data were performed using the free software, JASP® Team Computer software 2021(version 0.14.1.0)14. Symptom onset, tracking of outcomes, length of ICU stay, and mechanical ventilation time were compared between patients with symptoms suggestive of dengue and COVID-19 coinfection.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics and disease progression
A total of 43 patients that met the clinical criteria for suspected dengue and had RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were included in the study. Of these, 38 required hospital admission, and only 5 patients were assessed in the emergency room.
The patients had a mean age of 50.6 years, were predominantly male (60.5%), had a mean body mass index of 28.7 kg/m2, and 55.8% presented with comorbidities (Table 1). Arterial hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (25.5%), and 14% had two or more comorbidities. The mean duration of symptoms prior to admission was 6.4 days, with 8 patients requiring ICU admission and 6 requiring mechanical ventilation. Of the 43 patients included in the study, 5 died.
With regard to laboratory biomarkers, a majority of patients had lymphopenia (67.4%), 27.9% had leukopenia, and 23.3% had thrombocytopenia. For a prior history of dengue, 11 patients (25.58%) reported having dengue more than 1 year prior, and

Diagnostic tests for dengue
Of the patients included, seven (16.3%) tested positive on at least one diagnostic test for dengue on admission. Among these patients, two tested positive on the NS1 antigen test, three on the IgM test, one on the IgG test, and one was reactive for both IgM and IgG.
Patients who tested positive on serological tests were investigated for the possibility of coinfection or cross-reaction (false-positive) according to the results of the initial and followup RID tests (Table 2). Clinical symptoms were similar between coinfected patients and those with positive cross-reactions. All patients had elevated CRP concentrations (Table 3).
In addition to the symptoms and alterations in laboratory parameters, other characteristics of the trajectory of patients who tested positive for dengue are outlined below, together with evidence for the classification of possible infection, cross-reaction, or previous infection, which are summarized in Table 3. Two of the 3 patients with possible coinfections died.
Patient 5 was not included in Table 3 because he had evidence of previous dengue infection based on RID tests for dengue, and tested positive for IgG and negative for IgM and NS1. He also had a history of dengue infection 2 years prior. He was admitted to the hospital on the 8th day of symptoms, progressed to a moderate case of COVID-19, and was discharged on the 4th day of his hospital stay.
DISCUSSION
The difficulty in differentiating dengue from COVID-19 is a cause for concern in countries with a high incidence of both viruses15-18. The present study confirmed this diagnostic difficulty by presenting a case series of patients who met the criteria for suspected dengue and had a clinically confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.

Although respiratory symptoms are important in cases of suspected COVID-19, unspecific systemic symptoms, such as fever, headache, and myalgia, were most common in the present study, followed by cough, diarrhea, and respiratory distress, due to the inclusion criteria of this investigation. Compared with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common symptom among inpatients with COVID-19 was shortness of breath, while less than half of the patients presented with fever on hospital admission19. Among outpatients, however, fatigue, headache, and myalgia followed by sore throat, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea were more frequent19. Thus, in outpatients with COVID-19, the predominance of systemic symptoms hampers the differential diagnosis. The symptoms common to both diseases, together with the symptoms that differentiate them, are shown in Figure 2.

Cough is a frequent respiratory symptom of COVID-19 but is uncommon in dengue12,20. Studies comparing COVID-19 and dengue confirmed that systemic symptoms, such as fever, myalgia, and headache, predominate over respiratory symptoms in dengue17,21.
In the present case series, only 27.8% of patients presented with leukopenia and 23.3% with thrombocytopenia, a characteristic of dengue, while lymphopenia, a common feature of COVID-19, was the most prevalent manifestation (67.4%). This result mirrors the studies conducted by Rosso et al. (2021), who found higher

rates of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in dengue patients17 and by Gupta et al. (2020), who also found a high prevalence of lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients22. In studies of cases with coinfection, fever was the most common symptom, followed by dyspnea, fatigue, and headache. The most prevalent laboratory findings were thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia11.
The two viruses show differences in clinical progression, which can be useful in their differential diagnoses. While in dengue, a sudden decrease in temperature between the 3rd and 5th days is a

sign of severity1, in COVID-19, fever may persist for over 7 days, commence or worsen later in patients who progress to severe forms15, and may not be present at all in older adults23.
Several cases of coinfection have been reported in many countries6,10,24-29. However, studies of coinfection have yielded conflicting results. In a study of 13 cases of coinfection in Argentina, Carosella et al. (2021) found a predominance of systemic symptoms, fever in all patients, and no deaths10. In contrast, a study involving 50 cases of coinfection found fever in 52% of patients and a greater rate of progression to death, and most of these cases had alarm signs or severe dengue29. However, unlike the present study and the Argentinian investigation, the cited study did not confirm COVID-19 diagnosis using RT-PCR, possibly contributing to the diagnostic uncertainty.
Coinfection with dengue as a factor for severity for patients with COVID-19 and its association with mortality have also been observed11. Moreover, prior dengue infection was found to confer no protection against COVID-1930 and contributed to a greater rate of hospitalization31. Although the present study involved only a small number of cases, two of the three coinfected patients died.
The occurrence of cross-reaction with the dengue antigen and antibody test among flaviviruses, such as Zika and yellow fever viruses32, has been described. However, cross-reactivity of serological IgM and IgG antibody tests in patients with COVID-19 and dengue has been observed both in the present study and by several other authors6,9,33. Lustin et al.9 found a 22% falsepositivity rate using dengue IgM/IgG RID tests in patients with RT-PCR-diagnosed COVID-19 in a non-endemic region for dengue, although these results were not confirmed when repeated using the ELISA technique. In the present study, only three (7%) patients had possible cross-reactions, a pattern similar to that reported by other authors34,35. A study conducted in Indonesia that assessed 95 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID cases based on dengue RID tests detected only one IgM-positive case, one IgG-positive case, and one probable case of coinfection with positivity for NS1, IgM, and IgG34. In an Italian study, no IgM/IgG positivity for dengue was found in 32 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, although the tests were performed using ELISA36. In Colombia, a study on the accuracy of the ELISA IgM/IgG test for SARS-CoV-2 in different groups found no positivity in serum samples of patients diagnosed with dengue in 201937.
However, a study of 120 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Singapore, also analyzing the accuracy of the dengue RID tests, found positivity for IgG in only four patients38 classified as having a previous infection. Unlike the present study, the patients' symptoms were not assessed. Akin to the present investigation, none of the cited studies reported cross-reactions with NS1.
The present study had some limitations. First, a small number of patients were included, explained by the inclusion criteria of symptoms of suspected dengue. Second, low circulation of DENV in the city during the study period may have contributed to the occurrence of a few cases of coinfection. Third, the method used for diagnosing dengue was the RID test, and DENV positivity was not confirmed via RT-PCR or ELISA. This shortcoming was partially remedied by repeating the RID tests after 12-40 days in patients who tested positive for acute-phase dengue (NS1 antigen and IgM antibody).

Similar to other studies, the present study identified both patients with positive cross-reactions and those with coinfection6,33. These findings highlight the need for screening tests that can offer greater diagnostic accuracy than RID tests, and for protocols that help physicians treat patients with acute febrile syndrome in dengue and COVID-19 endemic regions, particularly during a period outside the peak incidence of the two diseases.

Background: Countries worldwide are focusing to mitigate the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by employing public health measures. Laboratories have a key role in the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Serology for SARS-CoV-2 is of critical importance to support diagnosis, define the epidemiological framework and evaluate immune responses to natural infection and vaccine administration. Aim: The aim of this study was the assessment of the actual capability among laboratories involved in sero-epidemiological studies on COVID-19 in EU/EEA and EU enlargement countries to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies through an external quality assessment (EQA) based on proficiency testing. Methods: The EQA panels were composed of eight different, pooled human serum samples (all collected in 2020 before the vaccine roll-out), addressing sensitivity and specificity of detection. The panels and two EU human SARS-CoV-2 serological standards were sent to 56 laboratories in 30 countries. Results: The overall performance of laboratories within this EQA indicated a robust ability to establish past SARS-CoV-2 infections via detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, with 53 of 55 laboratories using at least one test that characterised all EQA samples correctly. IgM-specific test methods provided most incorrect sample characterisations (24/208), while test methods detecting total immunoglobulin (0/119) and neutralising antibodies (2/230) performed the best. The semiquantitative assays used by the EQA participants also showed a robust performance in relation to the standards. Conclusion: Our EQA showed a high capability across

Key public health message
What did you want to address in this study? Robust serological test systems to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human serum samples are important to establish whether past infections occurred and to assess the extent of immunity in the population. We want to enable laboratories and countries employing public health measures to assess the quality and robustness of different serological tests that are being used in European expert laboratories. What have we learnt from this study? The majority of laboratories (53 of 55) used at least one serological test that was able to characterise all the serum samples correctly. The performance of serological assays varied for different types of antibodies. What are the implications of your findings for public health? Our study showed a high capability across European reference laboratories for reliable diagnostics for SARSCoV-2 antibody responses. Aside from assessing the total share of people with immunity in the population, reliable serological diagnostics are also important to guide public health actions by helping to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic cases.

Introduction
Countries worldwide are focusing to mitigate the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic [1] by employing public health measures, including increasing vaccination roll-out and restriction of movements. Laboratories have a key role in the control of the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by detecting acute and previous infections with the virus in a reliable and timely fashion. While the detection of acute infections, typically done by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) or antigen (Ag) testing, can be used to stop transmission chains through isolation and quarantine measures [2], the detection of immunological markers for past SARS-CoV-2 infections and/or vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 is used to estimate immunity [3] in both individuals and communities, thereby informing mitigation strategies. Most serological assays detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as the main immunological marker. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the spike protein represents one of the main concerns for the potential of immunological escape from the antibodies response.
The vast impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public health, economies and societies drives the rapid development of numerous serological assays by laboratories and commercial entities [4]. These tests are not only based on different techniques, e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA), lateral flow assays (LFA) and virus neutralisation tests (VNT), but also use different antigenic targets and are able to detect different types of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, e.g. total immunoglobulin (Ig), IgG, IgM, IgA and/or neutralising antibodies. Besides the fact that each laboratory needs to perform validation and evaluation studies before implementing a new test [5], it is crucial to assess the capability of the laboratory to perform the test through an external quality assessment (EQA) based on proficiency testing. Proficiency testing enables a comparison of the accuracy of different tests and the performance of different laboratories based on the same material [6-10].
Here, we describe the set-up and results of such an EQA of detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among European expert laboratories that are members of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) COVID-19 and influenza laboratory networks, laboratories involved in sero-epidemiological studies on COVID-19 in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and EU-enlargement countries and/or members of the Emerging Viral Diseases-Expert Laboratory Network (EVD-LabNet). The proficiency panel comprised different isotypes of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In addition, laboratories also received two

in EU/EEA and EU-enlargement countries and/or members of the Emerging Viral Diseases-Expert Laboratory Network (EVD-LabNet) were invited to participate this EQA study. Registration was closed on 2 February 2021. Fifty-four laboratories received one EQA panel and two JRC standards between 22 February and 5 March 2021, one laboratory registered later and received the packages on 24 March 2021. The online submission form to submit EQA results was open until 8 April 2021.
Panel composition
The EQA panels were composed of eight different, fully characterised, pooled human serum samples and addressed both sensitivity and specificity of detection. Five samples contained anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, while three samples did not (Table 1). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive sera were collected from individuals with different severities of disease: mild, non-hospitalised cases (two samples that contained mixed sera from multiple patients) and severe, hospitalised cases (three samples that contained mixed sera from multiple patients). The sera from individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection were a collection of residual routine diagnostic anonymised samples and not suitable to evaluate antibody waning. The median time from infection diagnosis to sample collection was 17.5 days (range: 5-92 days). The obtained serology results for the preparation of the EQA were not used for the clinical management of the patients. All sera from individuals with a SARSCoV-2 infection were collected in 2020 before COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. The sera from individuals with acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection were collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 at the end of 2019 and were anonymised. In addition, sera from individuals with an acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection were anonymised. The anti-SARS-CoV-2-negative sera were pre-pandemic residual sera from routine diagnostics provided by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INMI) in Rome, Italy and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in Bilthoven, the Netherlands. All panel sera, including the pre-pandemic sera, contained antibodies directed against the common cold coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43; HCoV-229E; HCoV-NL63; HCoV-HKU1). In addition to the EQA panel, all participants received two human SARSCoV-2 serological standards produced and described by the JRC: EURM-017 and EURM-018 [11,12].
External quality assessment panel preparation
The freeze-dried equivalent of 0.2 mL pooled anonymised sera was prepared for each panel sample (Table 1). Samples were pooled to obtain sufficient volumes for uniform preparation of the total number of required panels. All pooled samples were heat-inactivated (56°C for 30 min) and freeze-dried in 0.2 mL aliquots (FreeZone Benchtop Freeze Dryer, LABCONCO, United States (US)). Successful virus inactivation of panel samples was confirmed by the absence of viral growth in two consecutive cell culture passages. All

samples were provided coded Sample A to Sample H, with no further identifying information given. The standards EURM-017 and EURM-018 were produced and shipped by JRC. Product information on the materials is publicly available [11,12].
Samples characterisation, testing instructions
Each sample of the EQA panel was extensively characterised by the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 reference laboratories at INMI and RIVM, using a wide variety of serological tests (tests and outcomes of the panel characterisation are provided in Supplementary Table S1). Based on this characterisation, the final composition of the EQA panels was defined (Table 1). All samples of the EQA panel, including the anti-SARS-CoV-2-negative samples (C, E and F) were determined to contain antibodies against the four common human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoVHKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63) by protein micro-array as a quantitative multiplex immunoassay [13].
The EQA panels were shipped at room temperature. The serological standards were shipped separately on dry ice. Laboratories received detailed reconstitution, testing and storage instructions with the panels, advising to centrifugate the lyophilised samples for 1 min at 3,000 rpm to sediment material which might stick to the cap, reconstitute the samples in 200µL sterile water for ca 1 h, vortex the samples for ca 10 sec to resuspend the material properly, and centrifugate the samples to spin down the reconstituted materials to avoid contamination. Laboratories were informed that the EQA panel samples consisted of inactivated, non-infectious human sera, but no specific information was provided, i.e. positivity and negativity to anti-SARS-CoV-2.
The JRC standards were ready to use upon receipt. It was advised to store the material as follows: original material of the EQA panel at room temperature (acceptable range: -20°C to +25°C), and at 4°C once the material was reconstituted; original material of the JRC standards frozen (acceptable range: -20°C to -80°C), and at 4°C once the material was thawed. Laboratories were informed that the provided standards contained anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as they received the product information sheet alongside the EQA panel.
Evaluation of results
The testing instructions provided a link to the online result submission platform. In the online submission form, laboratories were asked to give detailed information on each of the tests that they performed on the EQA panel and JRC standards, including the type of detectable antibodies. Since a the majority of serological tests only require small volumes, multiple different tests could be performed. For each method, the laboratories had to indicate whether they detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the EQA samples, the specific result of the test and how they interpreted the outcome of the test. Because laboratories had to

submit their results per specific test used, the EQA outcomes could be analysed on individual test level, as well as on laboratory level (multiple tests per laboratory). There was no minimum or maximum limit for how many tests could be assessed with the EQA panels and submitted in the online submission form.
For the purposes of this EQA, the panel outcomes with an individual test submitted by a laboratory were referred to as a `test', i.e. in total, results of 162 tests were submitted by 55 laboratories (for instance, two laboratories used seven tests to characterise the EQA samples, 16 used three tests, 10 used one test only) (Figure 1). Tests that were used by multiple laboratories that were either the same commercial test or had the same principle (e.g. VNT) were referred to as `assays', i.e. in total 53 commercial and in-house assays (Supplementary Table S2 lists the commercial and in-house tests assessed by EQA participants) were used by 55 laboratories resulting in a submission of results of 162 tests.
Statistics Data were collected and analysed in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Bellingham, US) and GraphPad Prism 9 software for Windows version 9.1.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, US). Performance of specific tests was analysed by comparison of the amount of correct vs false results, either grouped by assay type or by isotypes of detectable antibodies, using two-sided Yates' corrected chi-squared test. Results with a p value0.05 were considered statistically significant. Furthermore, Spearman's rank correlation test was used to assess correlation of EQA performance as fraction of correct results, with sample input volume as specified by the EQA participants.
Results
External quality assessment participation and overall laboratory and test performance
Fifty-six laboratories registered to participate in the EQA. In total, 55 laboratories from 30 countries, namely 27 of 30 EU/EEA countries and three of seven EU pre-accession countries, reported individual panel results representing 162 tests (Figure 1A), while one laboratory did not submit any results. The number of different tests assessed per laboratory varied between 1 and 7 (Figure 1B).
Thirty-six of 55 laboratories characterised all EQA samples correctly with all tests they assessed, while 17 additional laboratories used at least one test that identified all EQA samples correctly (Figure 1B). Only two laboratories could not identify all samples correctly (Figure 1B). On test level, 82.1% of the submitted tests (133/162) detected all tested samples correctly. While the outcome for the samples of pooled sera from hospitalised patients and for one sample of the pooled sera from mild patients (A, D, H and B) ranged between
8

98.7% and 100.0% correct results, samples C (negative pre-pandemic), E (acute CMV+EBV infection) and G (mild COVID-19, A+/G+/M+(low)) showed slightly lower proportions for correct identification ranging from 95.0% to 96.3% (Table 1). The sample with the least correct results, 88.8%, was sample F (negative prepandemic, Table 1). The correct identification proportion for the JRC standards was 94.9% for EURM-017 and 96.8% for EURM-018 (Table 1).
Assay performance
Overall, false-negative results occurred less frequently than false-positive results (Figure 1C, Table 2). Of the 161 tests, 135 (83.9%) characterised all specificity samples (C, E, F) correctly. Furthermore, we analysed assays separately for each antibody isotype they could detect when laboratories submitted these individual results. Assays for which no individual isotype results were submitted were grouped as `IgM/IgG' and `IgM/IgA' (Table 2). IgM-specific tests performed least accurately and were significantly worse at identifying samples correctly than tests detecting total immunoglobulin (Table 2). For each group, IgA, IgG or IgM, multiple assays gave at least one false outcome; respectively, two of six, seven of 32 and eight of 14 assays had at least one false result.
In total, 41 commercial assays and 12 in-house assays were used by the EQA participants (listed in Supplementary Table S2). Overall, 3.5% (37/1,058) of reported results using commercial assays and 2.6% (6/231) using in-house assays were incorrect. Of all 162 tests used by participants, 75 (46.3%) were ELISAbased, 43 (26.5%) were CLIA/chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA)/electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) tests and 22 (13.6%) VNTs. The remaining 22 (13.6%) included, among other types of tests, LFA, plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT), protein micro-array and immunofluorescence assay/ enzyme-linked fluorescence assay.
Among those assays performed by three or more EQA participants, two in-house assays (VNT, PRNT) and six commercial assays (Abbott - SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant, Beijing Wantai Biological - SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA, Euroimmun - Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA IgG, Roche - Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S, Vircell microbiologists - COVID-19 ELISA IgM+IgA and GenScript - SARSCoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralisation Test Kit) correctly characterised all EQA samples in all laboratories that assessed these assays (Table 3). None of the assays performed significantly better than the group `Other' (i.e. all tests that were used byfewer thanthree laboratories) considering two-sided Yates' corrected chisquared test. One test (Euroimmun - Anti-SARS-CoV-2 NCP ELISA IgM) performed significantly worse than `Other' (p value<0.0001) (Table 3).

Qualitative and semiquantitative results in relation to Joint Research Centre standards
Four qualitative assays in this EQA had been previously used to characterise the JRC standards as positive, both EURM-017 [11] and EURM-018 [12]: Genscript (cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralisation Antibody detection kit), Roche (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2), Abbott (SARSCoV-2 IgG) and Abbott (SARS-CoV-2 IgM). In this EQA, Genscript and Roche scored all samples correctly, while the assays of Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and SARS-CoV-2 IgM each scored one standard incorrectly (EURM-018) as negative.
Laboratories were asked to specify the exact (numerical) results of each test they used to assess how semiquantitative assays performed across different laboratories in comparison to the reference product information available for the two JRC standards. Figure 2 and Table 4 show an overview of the numerical results for all semiquantitative specific assays that were used by three or more laboratories. Notably, results of three of the semiquantitative assays, namely by Abbott (SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant), GenScript (cPass SARSCoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralisation Test Kit) and Roche (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S) characterised all EQA samples correctly; their results for the JRC standards corresponded to previous JRC characterisations (Table 4). Absolute titres obtained with the various virus neutralisation assays varied between laboratories (range: 12- to 115-fold differences).
Influence of various parameters on the performance of the external quality assessment
The vast majority of laboratories used the advised volume of 200 µL sterile water to reconstitute the EQA samples (51/55 laboratories) as well as the storage advice for both the EQA panels (54/55 laboratories) and the JRC standards (50/55 laboratories). We did not see any influence of these parameters on test performance. Although sample input volume for the different tests ranged from 1 µL to 170 µL, it did not correlate with the fraction of correct results by test (p=0.3251; Spearman correlation test).
Considering antibodies directed to different antigenic proteins targeted in the serological assays, the majority of the assays used (n=27) was based on the spike (S) protein, including recombinant full S or its specific domains (S1, S2 or receptor-binding domain). Fifteen assays used both N and S proteins, while six targeted the anti-N response only. In addition, 18 assays used whole live virus isolates for VNT/PRNT, while for three in-house assays, the viral antigen was not reported. No influence of the target protein on test results was observed.
Discussion
The overall performance of laboratories within this EQA indicated a robust ability to establish whether past SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred via detection of antiSARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All except two laboratories
10

used at least one assay that identified all samples correctly as SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive or negative. IgM-specific assays showed the most incorrect characterisations of the EQA samples. In particular, sample G (IgA+/IgG+/IgM+(low)) was missed by four of five laboratories that used the same commercial IgM-only assay (Euroimmun - Anti-SARS-CoV-2 NCP ELISA IgM) and by two additional assays that should have been able to detect the presence of IgM antibodies based on their technical specifications (AAZ - COVID-PRESTO TROD IgG/IgM; Hangzhou Biotest Biotech - RightSign COVID19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette). The remaining 20 laboratories were able to identify sample G correctly using 11 different assays. Indeed, this sample was characterised by the two reference laboratories to have IgM levels below the detection limit of some assays (find the detailed results listed in Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, eight of 14 IgM-specific assays resulted in one or more false-positive test results. Several studies have shown that in general, IgM assays have a lower sensitivity and specificity than IgG or total IgG assays [14-16]. Hence it is recommended to perform serodiagnostics on multiple isotypes simultaneously to improve the specifics of the overall diagnosis. In addition, although specific IgM antibodies can be detected as early as 4 days after infection and they can help to define the early antibody response, SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger unconventional antibody responses, with cases developing IgG before IgM or others with no IgM [17-19]. Indeed, the majority of laboratories (45/55) used more than one serological test to assess the samples. In case of result discrepancies between IgMspecific tests and tests detecting other types of immunoglobulins, laboratories should consider the timing of a potential infection, but also the higher unreliability of IgM-specific tests. Overall, test methods detecting total immunoglobulin, neutralising antibodies or IgG performed better than test methods that are IgA- or IgM-specific. Test method performance was different neither for commercial and in-house assays, nor for a specific test principle, e.g. ELISA, (s)VNT, PRNT or CLIA/ CMIA/ECLIA. This was also shown by the variety of test methods that characterised 100.0% of tested samples correctly (Table 3).
Correct characterisation of the three specificity samples (C, E and F) was more problematic than of the sensitivity samples. Variable test performance for specificity samples has been reported before [20,21]. A likely explanation is potential cross-reactivity with antibodies raised by previous infection with other human coronaviruses causing the common cold [13], as all samples in the proficiency panel of this EQA also contained antibodies against all other seasonally circulating human coronaviruses (Supplementary Table S1). If this was the case, specificity test performance would probably be further reduced in periods of high prevalence of co-circulating seasonal coronaviruses.
As expected, the absolute titres obtained with the various virus neutralisation assays varied between

laboratories as underlying protocols can vary extensively (e.g. whole viruses or pseudotype viruses, number of median tissue culture infectious dose units, incubation period and temperature, cell lines, cut-off, read-out) and this gold standard serology method is mostly used as a research tool in the virology field. A recent European study showed that indeed a substantial heterogeneity exists in neutralising antibody testing approaches, resulting in almost 100-fold differences in raw neutralising titres. However, a direct comparison was possible through harmonisation by the use of a standard defined in IU/mL, which reduced the inter-laboratory variability ca 10-fold [22]. Another study showed that the inter-laboratory variation for neutralisation tests was reduced more than 50-fold when assay outcomes were reported relative to the same (WHO) standard [23]. In our study, the results of the VNT could not be compared through normalisation as the JRC standards were defined with a titre range for neutralisation tests and not with a defined IU/mL as in the WHO standard [24].
The characterisation of the JRC standards with the semiquantitative binding assays by the EQA participants was in range with the standards product information, indicating a robust performance of these semiquantitative assays across different laboratories. The qualitative assays that were used to define the JRC standards performed similarly in the EQA as well.
Notably, all samples used in this study were obtained from patients with natural SARS-CoV-2 infections. We did not include samples from vaccinated individuals. For future sero-epidemiological surveillance studies, the capacity of serological tests to differentiate between antibodies derived from natural infections and antibodies induced by vaccination is desirable. This can be achieved by using serological tests with different antigenic targets, i.e. anti-N (natural infection only) and anti-S detection, to determine the level of natural immunity in the study population and assess the risk of vaccination not being sufficient to protect against a potentially increasing burden on the healthcare system. EQA programmes including also sera from vaccinated people would be of great interest to expand the evaluation of the accuracy of different tests during the next phases of the pandemic when vaccination campaigns are consolidated in most countries worldwide.
Proficiency testing in EQA schemes allows to compare the accuracy of different tests and the performance of different laboratories based on the same material. Although the number of study participants (n=55) and moreover the total number of performed tests (n=162) was sufficient to gain valuable insights into the quality of serological SARS-CoV-2 assays, the abundance, availability and variety of different SARS-CoV-2 assays used by the participants, limits the number of results obtained per specific assay by different laboratories and therefore the statistical power and confidence in the results. It would be desirable to perform additional

follow-up studies. The wide variety in tests used and general lack of routine incorporation of international standards in SARS-CoV-2 serology prevents comparisons of immune responses across laboratories, thereby hampering standardised cross-border sero-epidemiological surveillance and the wide implementation of immunoassays to identify correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2, e.g. in the context of vaccination policies or the EU Digital COVID Certificate Regulation [25].
Nevertheless, proficiency testing is important for individual laboratories. The results of an EQA allow laboratories to identify potential problems and improve the reliability of their diagnosis. Interestingly, one laboratory repeated their tests upon receipt of their EQA results which included three false negative results using two different assays. In this second attempt, the results were correct. This laboratory indicated insufficient homogenisation of the samples as a potential explanation for the observed discrepancies.
Conclusion
A general capability for reliable, harmonised and standardised characterisation of the main immunological markers of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to increase the overall utility of serology testing. Potential inconsistent test performance and the absence of a rationale to use quantitative antibody assays due to the, yet, undetermined correlates of protection of antibody levels, currently limits the overall usefulness of serology. Participation in EQAs may help to improve implementation of diagnostic tests. Our EQA showed a high capability across European reference laboratories for reliable diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. Serological tests that provide robust and reliable detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are available. However, the use of standards is necessary for meaningful quantitative measurements to increase the overall use of serology testing, including the evaluation of antibody waning and possible reactivity against more relevant virus variants with immunological escape potential in the prospective of a more `personalised' approach to vaccination strategies. This is particularly relevant given that serology is no longer restricted to reference laboratories. Numerous laboratories non specialised in microbiology are performing serological tests using a wide panel of commercial assays. In order to maintain serological test quality, it would also be advisable to implement EQAs at national level, including schemes to evaluate and distinguish natural immunity and vaccination response.

There is growing evidence that viruses responsible for pandemics, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome, are mainly spread through aerosols. Recommendations have been introduced to reduce the transmission risks of virulent airborne viral particles by increasing ventilation rates, expressed in air changes per hour (ACHs), effectively improving the dilution of pathogens via mechanical ventilation. However, infrastructural and operational costs associated with upgrades of building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems make these solutions expensive. It is well documented that Ultraviolet Subtype C (UVC) disinfection can help lower exposure risks by inactivating viruses and the performance of such solutions can translate into equivalent ventilation. Here, we present the first framework to extract the optimal UVC requirements to improve facility management yet ensuring compliance with ventilation guidelines at lower energy costs. The Kahn-Mariita (KM) model considers the air quality of shared enclosed spaces over time by supplementing the existing mechanical ventilation with localized UVC air treatment and includes variables such as room size, occupancy, existing ventilation, and target equivalent ACH. For example, the model applied to a conference room shows that a UVC chamber with recirculation rates of 160 m3/h increases ventilation from an ACH 3 to 7.9 and reduces the room's reset time from 46 to <10 min with as little as 1 W. Recirculation rates of 30 m3/h however offer no benefits beyond 200 mW, with an eACH of 3.9 and reset time of 31 min. The first finding is that single-pass disinfection is not an appropriate metric of performance, i.e., low recirculation rates increase single-pass disinfection, and, however, only treats a portion of the space volume within a given time, limiting the overall performance. Conversely, higher recirculation rates decrease single-pass disinfection but treat larger portions of air, potentially multiple times, and are therefore expected to lower the transmission risk faster. The second result is that for fixed amounts of recirculating air flow, increasing UVC power helps with diminishing return, while for a fixed UVC power, increasing the recirculating air flow will always help. This dynamic is particularly important toward optimizing solutions, given the constraints system engineers must work with, and

INTRODUCTION
The current COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the lack of readiness to manage pandemics globally and the need for solutions to disinfect the air, which is dominantly responsible for the transmission of pathogens (Zhang et al., 2020a) such as SARS-CoV-2 (Nardell, 2021). As temporary confinements implemented all over the world are slowly being lifted, there is an urgent need to implement safety measures to enable physical proximity between individuals, particularly in shared enclosed spaces such as offices, hospitals, schools, restaurants, and transportation systems (Zhang et al., 2020a). Ultraviolet Subtype C (UVC) radiation, emitted at 200-280 nm with germicidal effect and being able to disrupt nucleic acids (RNA or DNA) (Yin et al., 2013), can be used to disinfect the air, thus managing disease outbreak (Reed, 2010). UVC has exhibited effectiveness against hospital-acquired bacterial infections (Mariita and Randive, 2020), including the promise of lessening contact infections in long-term acute care hospitals (Ethington et al., 2018). In addition, studies carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated that UVC can rapidly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (Storm et al., 2020) even at high viral titers (Heilingloh et al., 2020). Also, the use of UVC to ensure clean air will save energy by warranting reduced building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy demand (Aviv et al., 2021).
With the worldwide accepted findings that the airborne transmission route is the most dominant and highly virulent form of COVID-19 transmission (Zhang et al., 2020a) and with people gathering in closed spaces essentially sharing the same air (Nardell, 2021), we have seen a global trend toward "healthy buildings," driven by the urgency for automated, documented, and reliable disinfection of air, surfaces, and water in shared enclosed/inside spaces. Typically, air quality is ensured by ventilation and increasing air changes per hour (ACHs), effectively diluting the virus by adding air and accelerating the reduction of airborne pathogen concentration (Memarzadeh and Xu, 2012). Unfortunately, in most cases, it is impractical to increase ACHs because required improvements in the existing HVAC systems are costly if at all possible with principal restrictions around ceiling heights, inability to upgrade the ducts or fan, and noise air flow pressure drop imbalance due to nonoptimal dimensioning that results from retrofit solutions. In addition, with centralized air systems, the risks of crosscontamination, with air being recirculated from one room to another, remain (Horve et al., 2020). In fact, except in hospitals, HVAC systems in closed public spaces are designed for the comfort of occupants, with odor control, removal of carbon dioxide, and humidity and temperature control, and may not have enough capacity for the right ACHs for airborne transmitted

disease prevention (Nardell, 2021). It has been demonstrated that improperly applied HVAC systems may contribute to the transmission/spread of airborne diseases (Correia et al., 2020) as also suggested by descriptions from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship (Zhang et al., 2020b). This has also been indirectly proven using airflow-dynamics models (Chen et al., 2011) and experimental modeling (Li et al., 2005). Additional recent findings suggest that HVAC systems can facilitate SARS-CoV2 transmission via shared air volumes with locations remote from areas where infected people reside (Horve et al., 2020). Moreover, HVAC contamination has been demonstrated in the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak, caused by another betacoronavirus (Kim et al., 2016).
Another complication for facility management around increasing ventilation lies with the associated energy consumption in such solutions, as revealed in studies by Aviv et al. (2021), Orme (2001), Awbi (2017), and Chenari et al. (2016). New carbon-zero regulations, energy efficiency scoring, and credits create a strong incentive for managers of these assets to reduce ventilation, the primary source of energy consumption. Indeed, the higher the fresh-air injection rate, the more the heating or cooling required and the more expensive it is if systems are optimized with control to adjust to unpredictable changes in external temperature and humidity. For instance, rotary heat exchangers widely used in new constructions to save energy by capturing heat have raised concerns due to potential transfer of viral loads between the return and supply air flows. Conflicting reports on this account have pushed building managers to bypass them, highlighting the friction between energy efficiency and air quality.
In this study, we present an alternative way of approaching the problem of air quality by using localized UVC for air treatment which is converted into an equivalent ventilation, which we will refer as eACH (sometimes found in the literature as eqACH), (Figure 1). In other words, we look at quantifying the equivalent increase of mechanical ventilation to reach similar air quality within a defined amount of time. This allows reaching ventilation targets without upgrading the existing HVAC system and reversely provides an opportunity to optimize (reduce) the existing ventilation already meeting the recommended ACH by substituting with local UVC solutions. The Kahn-Mariita (KM) model presented here has the potential to rapidly allow buildings to comply with ventilation guidelines such as from the ASHRAE (Schoen, 2020) and WHO (Atkinson et al., 2009), to improve their energy efficiency rating, and provide a simple framework to reopen shared enclosed spaces, increase the time spent in these shared enclosed spaces, and manage occupancy limits, thus accelerating a return to "normal life." The KM model is not limited specifically to SARS-CoV-2 and thus also offers a solution effective for any type of airborne microbial

contaminants, such as the flu, tuberculosis, and SARS-Cov-2 or MERS.
The uniqueness of the KM model lies in the incorporation of UVC with the existing ventilation. Previous studies from Kane et al. (Kane et al., 2018) and Walker and Ko (Walker and Ko, 2007) have investigated the effect of UVC on airborne pathogen reduction and defined performances of the UVC system independent of the existing ACH. In particular, studies have linked 1) UVC output to occupancy (García de Abajo et al., 2020), which yields a 25 mW/person requirement to increase an equivalent fresh-air injection rate by a factor of 2, and 2) UVC output to volume (Mphaphlele et al., 2015), which suggests 15-20 mW/m3 requirement to reduce risk down to baseline. None of these studies look at the integrated performances with the existing ventilation nor do they allow walking back from a target ACH. Here, we try to provide a strong model to output a room or space eACH rather than a device performance, which allows for better facility management and simplifying the integration of UVC systems for air treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The use of the KM model supports HVAC systems designed for closed shared spaces by helping understand the inactivation of viruses while achieving eACH, thus preventing the spread of viruses via HVAC systems as well as poorly ventilated shared enclosed spaces. This is even more important by recalling that some viruses in the betacoronavirus genera such as SARS-CoV-2 are approximately 60-140 nm (0.06-0.14 micron) in diameter (Cascella et al., 2021). These viruses can easily pass through common filtration systems whose pore size is more than 1 micron since HEPA filters are only used in certain spaces such as isolation rooms or intensive care units (ICUs) (Correia et al., 2020). The approach of eACH consists in assigning a quantitative measure, which consists of localized air treatment in poorly ventilated rooms with UVC light to reduce airborne contaminant concentrations, which corresponds to the same air quality

microbiologically to that of increased mechanical ventilation. The model and methodology we present allow quantification of optical energy needs to achieve a defined log reduction, in turn allowing compliance with ventilation targets and transmission risk control guidelines.
The KM model shows eACHs by defining air quality level--90% reduction of the steady-state concentration without UVC--and by relating UVC solution to the amount of time saved to reach the same air quality, which utilizes the following steps:
1. Define the steady-state concentrations of a system with the existing ACH and no UVC applied. This refers to a number of infective patients that would enter the space and remain until the steady-state concentration is reached. We are not interested in the time this process takes because it gives us the worst-case scenario. Any amount of time the patient would leave the room prior to that state reached would result in a lower concentration. A transient view shows this concentration is approached relatively quickly, typically within a minute.
2. Consider the infective person leaves the room; then, we factor the speed of the exponential decay in the above concentration due to ventilation. This is solely determined by the ACH, which considers the volume of the room and air speed.
3. Add a UVC source within a recirculating chamber within the room. Here, we model the efficiency of single-pass disinfection through the reactor design (size and materials of UVC reflectivity) and the air flow which defers from the room ventilation and is controlled locally. We compute the new steady-state concentration by adding the UVC on top of the existing ventilation, thus summing the clean air delivery rates (CADRs).
4. Extract the ACH from the difference in steady-state concentration and input this into the decay model. This yields the time to reach the target concentration level.
The KM model's microbial disinfection efficacy relies on UVC output, recirculation rate, existing ACH, and chamber design to

obtain the desired eACH. We find that the two most important factors are the existing ACH and recirculation rate, the first acting as a limiting element and the second as the highest contributor to the increase in equivalent ventilation. UVC output affects the single-pass performance, with its additional relative contribution to eACH regress. The increase in eACH in turn accelerates the time to reach a target concentration, which converges toward a minimum time.
The main problem with airborne pathogens is that in closed, poorly ventilated spaces, the risk of transmission remains high for a long period of time (Klompas et al., 2020). Both calculations and experimental measures show that aerosol droplet concentration is reduced by 63% (Nardell, 2021) for every ACH as demonstrated by van Rijn et al. (2020), Nunayon et al. (2020), and Bazant and Bush (2020). This means that in a typical office room with ACH 3, it takes >46 min to reach a 90% pathogen concentration reduction. This view assumes no new source of contaminants or ignores the droplets that attach onto surfaces. Indeed, recent studies support the theoretical concepts presented here by showing how reduction in viral concentrations affects the airborne transmission risk (Qian and Zheng, 2018), and the results deviated from the linear relationship as the marginal benefit of incremental disinfection or log reduction value (LRV) is lower than the previous one. The key conclusions here are as follows: 1) there is little added value from aiming to higher concentration reduction values than 90% and 2) because the risk is reduced mostly by relatively low reduction rates, any recirculating system should be designed for higher air flows with a low UVC dose rather than the conventional reactor designs traditionally used in water disinfection which aim at increasing the dose by reducing the flow. Here, the dynamics is the key and recirculation needs to be considered, as well as how quickly the total air volume is treated.
For example, consider a room of 50 m3, with an existing ACH of 3 (meaning it takes 46 min to reduce 90% concentration and bring transmission risk back to baseline) and a recirculating unit where air flows at two different velocities, 200 m3/h and 20 m3/h, respectively, into a 70% UVC reflective chamber with 700 mW of UVC optical output. Simple relationships allow estimation of the fluence rate from these parameters, which have proved to be a good prediction of microbial results. The higher fan power scenario "only" reduces 73% of pathogens in a single pass, while the lower fan power which increases the exposure time to UVC of air leads to >99.9999% reduction (LRV6) per pass. It must be noted that, in real term, to achieve such a high LRV value will require a very well-designed reactor since any deviation from all flows getting the exact same dose will have a large impact on the LRV (conversely, low LRVs are less sensitive to small variations). However, for the entire room to obtain a 90% reduction, there is acceleration from 46 min without UVC to 9 min for the higher fan power and to 35 min for the lower fan power, leading to eACH 8.5 and eACH 3.6, respectively. We therefore show that the dose or LRV is no longer the relevant metric for air treatment, as it is in both water and surface disinfection where single pass matters and regulations aim for full reductions of specific pathogens. Instead, the most important factors here are the existing ACH and the recirculation speed for the concentration to be sufficiently reduced to keep the risk close

to the baseline. The eACH model captures these dynamics and incorporates variables such as volume of air to be treated, occupancy, reactor design, UVC output and wavelength, and pathogen of interest and only outputs the equivalent ventilation rate and improved time to 90% reduction (other notations used here: D90 or 1 LRV).

Kahn-Mariita Model Dynamics
The airborne transmission risk TR(t)can be broadly defined as a sum of baseline risk R, which is a function of proximity between people d, a time-dependent term which is a product of the risk associated with the pathogen concentration R(C), and the exposure time t to the concentration C which will compound the risk. The time factor is modeled in a probabilistic manner with a location  and scale s dependency:

TR(t) R(d) + R(C)p 1 .

(1)

1 + e-t-s

Usually, in these applications, increasing the distance between people is the most efficient way to reduce contamination rates. The proximity effect is more pronounced when the ACH is higher because the concentration reduces faster. On the other hand, as a person stays in a closed space, the time-dependent term (second term in Equation 1) becomes the largest factor in the increase in airborne transmission risk. The goal of air disinfection is to bring that risk down converging toward the baseline risk R(d).

Concentration Buildup
Kowalski defines the steady-state concentration (Css) as the fraction of the contaminant release rate (RR) and the CADR which is the product of the removal efficiency (RE) and the total air flow (Q) in the recirculating chamber (Kowalski, 2009):

CSS RR , CADR REpQ.

(2)

CADR

Css steady-state airborne concentration, cfu/m3 RR contaminant release rate, cfu/min CADR clean air delivery rate, cfm (Kowalski, 2009)

In the past, the CADR has been used to assess the relative performance of filtration systems in recirculating chambers or that of UVC disinfection units (Kowalski, 2009). While it is a good metric to compare devices, the question as to what is the required CADR or chamber performance to meet end-user needs is not accessible simply by looking into a chamber on its own. As we will show, this answer needs to incorporate the existing ventilation, room volume, and occupancy and look at the marginal benefits from adding UVC as it relates to increasing occupancy, residence time, and reducing room's reset time. The KM model therefore starts with the CADR and links it to the end-user requirements. The advantage of CADR is the ability to measure it with microbial studies of single-pass performances; the risk however is to view this measurement as the final indication of performances.
A transient model allows for the estimation of the airborne concentration in a volume V as a function of time and is defined as follows:

The relationship between ACH and LRV is easily extracted from the decay relationship, showing a concentration reduction per ACH reduction factor (RED) % of 63.21% and an equivalent LRV of 0.43:

In our model, we first assume the initial concentration C0 0 and solve the equation over a given amount of time at a defined RR. The steady-state concentration for a system without UVC gives the following:

Previous studies have estimated the release rate for an infective person to be 99 RNA virus particles per minute, extrapolated from the weighted average of speaking and breathing particle release rate and the ratio of infective RNA-containing virus particles to total released particles (Curtius et al., 2021). Susceptible subjects require a dose of 100-1000 RNA virus copies to be inhaled to cause an infection in 50% of them (Lelieveld et al., 2020). The number of RNA virus particles can be extracted from the volume of the particle in ml and the concentration of RNA virus particles per exhaled particle of approximately 5 · 108 per ml (Lelieveld et al., 2020). Back to our example of a 50 m3 room with an existing ACH 3 and one infective person, the equivalent average Css is 63 RNA virus particles/m3. It is a straightforward manner to approach the transmission risk from the pathogen concentration factoring the breathing rate and time spent in the defined volume.

where 1LRV corresponds to C 10%. C0

The time to 90% is independent of the room size, but the steady-state concentration is. It is important to consider that the time to D90 is not enough. Indeed, 90% of the steady-state concentration reached with ACH 2 is approximately the steady-state concentration of ACH 20; thus, if the goal is 90% reduction of a given steady-state concentration, it becomes a different target concentration ratio for the other ACHs. In this case, the time to reach the Css (ACH 2) with ACH 20 is 0, meaning it is already the permanent state reached by reducing the buildup process. This is exemplified by

comparing the steady-state concentration at different ACHs, the time required to reach 90% reduction at the different levels, and the D90(Css(ACH x)) time reduction value (Table 1). The term D90(Css(ACH x)) refers to the time necessary to reach 90% reduction of viral concentration from that of the initial ACH x, with increased ventilation. This allows for consideration of varying equivalent ventilation rates, where reduction in the steady-state concentration with increased ACH or eACH effectively reduces the C/C0 ratio and accelerates the path to the target viral particle concentration. This will be particularly important in bridging data collected in microbial tests where standard protocols only activate UVC after the desired microbial concentration is reached, to an application where the UVC is constantly on. The benefits of increasing the ACH become very clear and the model helps quantifying the addition of UVC on the eACH and time reduction.

Ultraviolet Subtype C Chamber:
Concentration Buildup
Now, we add a UVC recirculating unit, which will increase the eACH in two processes: it will first lower the buildup concentration reached in the steady-state model and will accelerate the decay time to the original D90 with a lower ratio required. First, we look at the steady-state concentration with UVC recirculation, CUssV+ACH, which is found by summing the CADR of mechanical ventilation (above) and that of UVC. The RED depends on the UVC output and the design parameter of the UVC chamber (residence time and reflectivity). The relationships are shown in Appendix:

The buildup concentration can be understood as the risk for people present in the room and therefore defines the amount of time they can share the space. The decay concentration which we provide in the next and final step allows to plot the room's reset time for the risk to be minimized for a new person to enter the space once the infective subject has left the room. This sawtooth wave function allows considering risk in a dynamic mode, relevant to the different factors.
Css can be calculated at various ACHs for a given system (Table 2). It is evident from the calculations that the relative usefulness of UVC is higher at existing lower ACHs and thus this understanding provides a framework for compliant buildings with high ventilation rates to reduce the existing ventilation and maximize the use of UVC while reducing energy consumption, a win-win situation.

As the ratio of the target concentration level to the buildup concentration approaches 1 with higher ACH (remember the increase in ACH--or the eACH--reduces the buildup steadystate concentration), the time approaches 0. This can be well understood by the fact that the baseline risk remains dominant irrespective of the time spent in a space.

DISCUSSION
It is interesting to look at the effect of UVC output and recirculation rate on the eACH. First, let us consider a change in output and all else equal, with the parameters described above and for an existing ACH 3, which provides the eACH reached with an output ranging from 200 mW to 10 W of useful UVC output. It should be noted that the LRV presented assumes that it follows a linear trend between the dose and every additional LRV, which is not always the case. The model is not focused on the LRV of this problem since it considers the time to reach a single LRV (90% reduction), but it is useful to show that the relative

benefits of the UVC dose on the eACH decrease with an increase in dose. There is no noticeable difference in eACH or time reduction beyond 1 W (eACH 7.9 and 9 min to D90) and the best use of energy around 500 mW (eACH 7.2 and 11 min to D90), compared to the 46 min without UVC (Table 3).
It is evident that the principal factor in increasing the ACH is the recirculation rate, that is, if too low no matter how much output, only a fraction of the volume will be treated within the time for 1 LRV to occur "naturally" with the existing ventilation. We show this by comparing two sets of data (Tables 3, 4), which look at the same system except that the recirculation rate is reduced from 160 m3/h to 30 m3/h. The single-pass disinfection rate increases on the whole but the maximum eACH reachable and disinfection time are reduced dramatically. In addition, there is almost no difference between 200 mW and 10 W (50x higher output) on the eACH (Table 4), even though the disinfection per pass is increased by a couple of orders. The key is therefore to understand the limiting factor in the system, defined as the parameter which prevents the increase in other variables to translate into increase in eACH. In this example, it is the recirculation rate. At a higher recirculation rate, output matters more; however, we see again a nonlinear contribution between the UVC output and its relative increase in eACH or decrease in time to D90(Css(ACH)). At 160 m3/h, we find that 500 mW provides 93% of the benefits of 10 W. It must be highlighted that one important assumption in the model does not consider re-mixing after every pass in the chamber.
While we have shown the limiting factor to be the recirculation rate in air chambers, upper-air systems would definitely not be subject to this limitation. Instead, the KM model can be adapted for upper-air systems by using air convection due to heating and ventilation as recirculation rates, assuming perfect and constant air mixing (which is typically one of the main assumptions in epidemiological models such as Wells-Riley) (Bazant and Bush, 2020) as well as a "UVC corridor" acting as a chamber with 0% reflection, meaning the UVC is fully absorbed by the ceiling of the opposite wall.
Another important concept of the KM model is the fact that UVC is seen as a complementary addition to the existing ventilation, therefore offering an integrated model of actual performances.
A recent study using upper-air systems with both low-pressure mercury lamps and UVC LEDs as light sources showed that a reduction time to 90% of initial concentration just under 2 min from 14 min was naturally achieved with both sources (Nunayon

et al., 2020). The performance of the 200 mW LED-powered upper-air system was similar to a 21 W lamp one, which is explained by the fact that most of the lamp output remains in the upper-air module: the actual UVC output which is transmitted out of the upper-air module is estimated to be around 375 mW considering the conversation of electrical to optical energy (33%), the normalization to germicidal power at 265 nm (90%), and the system loss due to the louvers (6% efficiency). The KM model predicts that the 200 mW system should have accelerated the risk reduction to 4.2 min and the 375 mW (lamp) system to 3.4 min yielding an eACH of 22 and 25, respectively. While the overall performances are well captured, we attribute the differences from the air recirculation in the room which is not properly included. In fact, upper-air experiments include the use of fans for air recirculation, which is not included here and would improve the performances as we have shown the importance of recirculation.
Quantifying Benefits
While the KM model allows for outputting eACH and its extracted time to D90 (equivalent to a potential definition of room's reset time for a shared indoor space before re-use), the benefits of eACH are readily found by inputting the new-ACH into the model by Bazant and Bush from MIT (Bazant and Bush, 2020) to quantify the benefits to end-users in terms of additional number of people or amount of time allowed into a shared enclosed space, thanks to the improved air quality level. For a volume of 50 m3 (a typical conference room of app. 4 × 5 × 2.5 m3), the proximity rule of 2 m between every occupant would limit the occupancy to six people. With ACH 3, a maximum of three people are allowed without mask for 1 h if the infective person is in the room, to limit transmission risk. With ACH 12, this number is increased to 7. The guideline restricts the probability of airborne transmissions per infected person to be

less than the risk tolerance over the cumulative exposure time listed.
The model developed by Bazant and Bush (2020) allows obtaining the maximum occupancy at different ventilation rates, which in turn allows for a direct comparison of the three approaches, namely, the UVC/occupancy, UVC/volume, and the KM model on equivalent ventilation as presented here. For a 50 m3 room, a maximum of five people are allowed at an ACH 7, with the eACH being reachable at various outputs (Table 3). The value of eACH 8 is the maximum reachable but does not allow additional benefit in occupancy from eACH 7. With a minimum output requirement of 25 mW/person, the first approach yields a 125 mW requirement for highly reflective chambers (PTFE >90%). This number would be directly affected by the UVC reflectivity of the material used in these designs, more so than the other approaches. For instance, an aluminum design (UVR 70%) would increase this value to approximately 400 mW.
The second approach on a volume of 15-20 mW/m3 yields 750-1,000 mW requirement. The difference between the two can be understood from the occupancy limitation imposed on the first, and thus, the higher requirement considers the maximum fill-up of the space. None of these considers the existing ventilation, nor the number of infective people in the room. The KM model does and outputs for a target eACH 7 from an existing ACH 3 with a requirement of 500 mW at 160 m3/h recirculating rate (Table 5). The difference from the occupancy model is that as eACH increases, the risk shifts from concentration in the air to the proximity, which is well captured: the KM proximity provides an output equivalent to the occupancy up the point where proximity restrictions are broken down. The volumetric and occupancy approaches converge as occupancy is increased to fill the volume; however, the hypothesis given here is that increasing output will not affect the risk level beyond a certain point.

models are also independent of the number of infective people, while our model allows incorporating this in larger spaces where the probability of multiple infection sources is higher than in the smaller spaces presented in these examples.
CONCLUSION
It is challenging to eliminate air recirculation such that only fresh air is supplied to occupants in shared enclosed spaces. The KM model offers blueprints that reduce airborne transmission of pathogens by adding UVC to localized systems and converting the benefits into eACHs, thus complementing the existing ventilation. The model particularly allows withdrawal from a target eACH given by benefits such as increase in occupancy or the time spent in shared enclosed spaces and output a UVC requirement as a function of UVC, space volume, existing ventilation, recirculation rate, and single-pass performance. This allows for devices to be tested on their singlepass performance and to link to the eACH as a function of the recirculation rate and the existing ventilation. Finally, and of importance for building sustainability, the KM model allows the balance of centralized ventilation and localized UVC air treatment options to decrease dependency on outside air injection and increase energy efficiency. This unified view of air quality and energy also provides an alternative approach to upgrade buildings to meet new carbon-zero requirements.

Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has forced health and education services to use additional human resources, such as health professional students. Students in the health professions, particularly those in the medical field, can participate in a variety of voluntary activities, both directly and indirectly in health services. The aim of this review was to determine the affecting factors, types of activity, and benefits of undertaking a volunteering role by the health professional student.
Methods: A systematic review of health professional student volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted using seven databases: Epistemonikos, ProQuest, Scopus, EBSCOhost, JSTOR, Cochrane Library, and PubMed. This literature search included published articles from March 2020 through to December 2021 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines.
Result: We included 41 studies that met the selection criteria that assessed the factors and specific programs related to health profession students' volunteering involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic era. The most frequently observed supporting factor of the eagerness to be a volunteer was the feeling of moral responsibility (such as social dedication, sense of duty, and care), potential learning opportunities, personal interest, and financial compensation. Factors that contributed to a person's refusal to participate in a volunteer position were the fear of COVID-19 itself (such as transmission, risk of being infected, and personal identification as a risk group).
Conclusion: The review of available literature has shown that understanding the motivation and barriers to the willingness of health professional students to volunteer and the impact of volunteering activities on their future lives is a key for supporting them.

Introduction
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread globally, creating a public health and safety crisis. The impact was felt in almost every facet of life, such as health and education services. Due to heavy workloads, health workers were at risk of developing psychological issues such as depression, anxiety, severe stress, and fatigue (1). The COVID19 pandemic also had an impact on the learning system for students, particularly those in the health professions, by shifting from face-to-face to online learning (2).
In this unprecedented era, e-learning may be an ideal option (3). However, it seems more applicable to preclinical phases of medical education, which are lecture-based. In contrast, clinical stages of medical education oblige students to work in interdisciplinary teams to practice their newly acquired clinical abilities while learning about the healthcare system. Therefore, the shift to e-learning may not facilitate clinical skills and competency acquisition during this stage (3, 4). However, it is understandable that medical schools had to postpone clinical clerkships to reduce student exposure, flatten the curve, and protect healthcare workers during the pandemic due to a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) (5).
Due to the COVID-19 problem, healthcare services were forced to use additional human resources, such as students from the healthcare professions. This phenomenon was due to the increased pressure on healthcare facilities, caused by the rise of new cases, shortage of doctors, and increased prevalence of burnout among health professionals (6). Students in the health professions, particularly those in the medical field, could participate in a variety of voluntary activities, both directly in health services (triage, admissions wards, hospital clinics, emergency departments, and diagnostic laboratories) and indirectly (call centers, community contact tracing, and community education) (7). The breaks from clinical rotations also provided opportunities for students to engage in academic writing, improve their understanding of critical appraisal abilities, conduct clinical trials, and learn about data analysis (5, 8).
The clinical setting participation varied across different countries and academic institutions. China, Italy, and the United Kingdom integrated medical students into their healthcare systems or graduated them earlier (9, 10). Other countries, such as South Korea and the United States, canceled clerkships to limit patient contact (11, 12). To participate in volunteer work, a student had to be provided with sufficient training, knowledge about their competence, strict supervision, and an adequate supply of PPE (13).
Health professional students volunteered to help the community, profession, and people overcome by COVID-19. From the students' perspective, this activity was oriented to express loyalty to the health profession, and strengthen a

professional sense of belonging (14). However, some students hesitated to volunteer due to various uncertainties, which could cause sleep problems, stress, persistent feelings of discomfort, dread, and anxiety (15). Volunteering offers several educational and social benefits, such as acquiring new skills in real-time data gathering, efficient communication with communities and public health groups, and social media monitoring (16). Therefore, it can help medical students prepare for their future careers as doctors (17). Due to this phenomenon, we conducted a systematic review to determine the motivating factors, barriers, types of activities, and benefits of health professional students volunteering activity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We utilized the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) recommendations for conducting this literature review (18). Before conducting the literature search, the study protocol was approved by all team members. We searched seven databases, including Epistemonikos, ProQuest, Scopus, EBSCOhost, JSTOR, Cochrane Library, and PubMed (Medline via PubMed), for published articles from March 2020 through December 2021 that assessed the factors and specific programs related to health profession students' volunteering involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic era. Hand-searching was also undertaken by examining the references of the selected articles to identify relevant publications that were not indexed in the previously described databases. This step utilized Google Scholar and journals with predominant publications related to health professional education, namely the British Medical Journal (BMJ), BMJ Open, and BMC Medical Education.
We used the following keywords in searching the literature: [(medical student OR health student OR health professional student OR online education OR online teaching OR medical school OR health institute) AND (COVID-19 OR SARSCoV-2 OR severe acute respiratory syndrome OR nCOV OR coronavirus OR pandemic OR outbreaks OR global crisis) AND (knowledge OR attitude OR practice OR volunteer OR reinforcing factors OR enabling factors OR experience OR opportunity) AND (health education OR health promotion OR health problems OR health support OR hospital OR triage OR tracing OR screening OR monitoring OR disease transmission OR drug administration OR health administration OR disease prevention)]. Two reviewers (TU and DA) searched the databases independently. We did not register our search strategy on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) to prevent unwanted delay and allow the data collection process to start immediately.

Study selection
We selected qualitative and quantitative (cross-sectional and cohort) studies that assessed the factors and particular programs relevant to the volunteering activity undertaken by health profession students during the COVID-19 pandemic (such as medical, public health, and nursing students). We only used peer-reviewed (excluding the preprints) full-text articles written in English to ensure data accuracy. Articles in the form of literature reviews, case studies, case-control, clinical trials, protocols, conference abstracts, news, editorials, and posters, as well as articles analyzing non-health professional student populations, were excluded. We also decided to exclude studies that explored pooled student populations. Three reviewers (TPU, MGS, and KMNN) independently screened titles and abstracts with semi-automatic processes using Rayyan QCRI, online software for abstract and title screening (19). The duplicates detected by this software were eliminated. Then, the discussion regarding any disagreements related to the title and abstract screening or full-text assessment was undertaken to reach a consensus. From the 1,239 articles obtained, 266 were removed due to duplications. We identified 162 papers for full-text and reference eligibility examination. In the final stage, 41 studies met the inclusion requirements for data synthesis (Figure 1).
Data extraction and synthesis
Data were extracted and synthesized from the selected studies. Three reviewers (TPU, MGS, and KMNN) extracted relevant information from each study individually, while one author (RAS) with experience in the medical education discipline reviewed the extracted data.
Each article was assessed for quality, such as authorship, years, country, health professional student populations, data collection methods, and key findings. Key findings related to the number of students who were willing to volunteer, motivating factors, benefits of volunteering, obstacles faced, and types of activity were all extracted. Both qualitative and quantitative data were obtained. Risk of bias analysis was determined by using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies checklist (20). The assessment of quality was not used to exclude the studies.
Result
Characteristics of included studies
The main characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The sample size ranged

from 12 to 10,433 health professional students (medical and other healthcare professions). Included studies predominantly employed medical students as their study population (31/41; 75.6%), whereas one study also using dental students (21) as their subject population. Seven studies (22-28) (17.1%) included multiple health student disciplines (e.g., public health, nutrition, midwifery, in addition to medical students), while three studies (29-31) (7.3%) exclusively recruited nursing students. Our analysis also covered a wide range of regional distributions, with two studies (32, 33) having a global distribution of respondents. The continents where most of the research originated were Europe, Asia, and America, with 34.1%, 26.8%, and 24.4% distributions, respectively. Meanwhile, Africa had a lesser distribution, with four studies (21, 29, 34, 35) (9.8%) included.
The total number of participants summed from all included studies was 37,000. Fifteen of the 41 studies (36.6%) included students from more than two institutions. The majority of the included studies (85.3%) were cross-sectional in design. Other observed types of study included qualitative and cohort studies, with 12.2% and 2.4%, respectively. Data were mainly taken from the primary source through an online questionnaire or survey (32/41 studies; 78.0%).
Study quality
We used the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies to assess the likelihood of bias in cross-sectional or cohort studies (Figure 2). Bias in research questions, study demographics, study participation (response rate), recruiting bias, and outcome measures were low (Figure 3). There was a moderate risk of bias since only 26.8% of studies explained the adjustment of their sample size. Meanwhile, a high risk of bias in measuring exposures of interest before outcomes and sufficient timeframes to detect an effect was detected. This phenomenon is mainly related to a large proportion of crosssectional studies, which only collect data (both exposure and outcome) simultaneously. Only 4.9% of studies measured and accounted for potential confounders, thus mostly having a high risk of bias. Overall, the included studies posed a moderate risk of bias, with an approximately equivalent share between low and high risk of bias studies.
Factors affecting health profession student willingness of participating as volunteer
Twenty-three papers (56.1%) reported factors impacting health profession students' desire to volunteer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventeen (41.5%) studies focused solely on the medical student population. Meanwhile, six others

concentrated on a wider variety of health professional or nursing students. Fourteen studies (34.2%) found a willingness to volunteer ranging from 19.5 to 91.5% (32, 36). However, the actual implementation of this willingness was only observed in a lesser proportion (6.5-67.9%) (25, 37-40), and their readiness level was still low (18.6-58.6%) (32, 38, 41).
The most frequently observed supporting factors for the eagerness to volunteer were: moral responsibility (social

dedication, sense of duty, and care), potential learning opportunities, personal interest, provision of adequate PPE, parental support, level of expertise, knowledge, and financial compensation. Lazarus et al. stated that the most significant demographic factors influencing willingness to volunteer were being male, residing in the central part of the country, pursuing education in a public institution, and previous volunteering activity (p < 0.05)

(41). A chain-mediation analysis of this phenomenon outlined four essential topics: altruistic motivation, prosocial encouragement, self-moral cognition, and reward (42). Included studies showed that in terms of gender, female

students (21, 24, 39, 43, 44) were more likely to be involved in the pandemic control and volunteering than males (35, 40, 41), with a willingness proportion of 60.2% (female) vs. 52.3% (male).

Some studies also uncovered elements that led to an individual's rejection of participating in a volunteer position. The critical factor was the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infection (such as transmission, risk of being infected, and personal identification as a risk group). A scarcity of PPE and the unavailability of a definitive treatment were cited as probable causes of this problem (41). Other observable characteristics included the uncertainty of their academic activity (due to a lack of time for reading, studying, and exams) (45, 46), fear about unfulfilling the volunteer task (associated with qualifications insufficiency) (7, 34), and coming from a lower-middle-income family (41). Another study found that personal perceptions of not being needed by the organization or institution and parental rejection may influence students' unwillingness to participate in a volunteer program (34).
Types of volunteering activity
Nine studies described the types of volunteering activities carried out by health professional students during the pandemic (7, 8, 22, 25, 27, 39, 46-48). The activities can be broadly divided into nine different categories, defined as hospital works (triage, admission wards, and emergency room) (7, 25, 27, 46), call center and administration (7, 27, 39, 46), epidemiological aspects (contact tracing, testing) (22, 47, 48), online or remote consultation (regarding COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 cases, using phone or internet) (46-49), laboratory-related works (47), food and/or PPE supply (27, 39), mentoring juniors (39), public education (such as countering hoaxes) (48), and in research programs (8). Some students also reported participating in more than one type of volunteering activity (7, 39).

Benefits of volunteering activity
Fourteen studies revealed the benefits of participating as a volunteer during the current pandemic from the health professional students' perspectives (7, 8, 16, 17, 22, 24, 27, 28, 46, 47, 50-53). The most frequently mentioned advantage was to learn and practice, especially to give real aid and explore evidence-based medicine (8, 16, 17, 22, 24, 28, 47, 53). Other benefits included collaborating with non-physicians (8, 22, 47), strengthening communication skills and empathy (8, 16, 17, 22, 24, 50, 54), knowing more about the healthcare system and costs (22), developing leadership and time management (24, 47, 52), helping other people (social benefits) (16, 17, 24, 28, 51), getting recognition (from friends, other healthcare workers, patients, etc.) (7, 46), providing an interactive learning platform (49), receiving financial compensation (52), and experiencing a research atmosphere (8). Following the positive impression of volunteering activity, three studies found a high level of willingness (73.2-94%) among health professional students regarding participation in the future (7, 49, 53). Regarding mental issues associated with volunteering, four studies found that student volunteers had low psychological stress (40, 44, 51, 55). The prevalence of anxiety and depression was lower among volunteering students than non-volunteering ones, indicating that it positively influenced general psychological wellbeing (40, 51).
Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has made substantial changes in social life. Due to societal constraints during this pandemic,

most of the included studies in this review relied heavily on primary data collected via online questionnaires or surveys. This method mainly provides quick, easy, and economical way to obtain large samples (56).
The current COVID-19 pandemic has pushed everyone to contribute. As future healthcare providers, health professional students are regarded as those with the closest capability to assist (57). This review analyzed health professional students' willingness to volunteer in pandemics, in addition to their motivation, benefits, and obstacles to volunteering. Health professional students' desire to participate as volunteers are influenced by moral responsibility, personal interest, social dedication, prosocial motivation, self-cognition, and learning opportunities. The majority of health professional students were willing to fight the pandemic (41, 46). The previous studies in Ireland also showed that the majority of health professional students would volunteer during pandemics (58).
There were various reasons for health professional students' eagerness to volunteer during the COVID-19 era. A shortage of medical personnel and sense of duty were the main reasons supporting the students' willingness to volunteer (41). Gender, volunteering experience, types of academic institution, place of living, and family income had higher scores for willingness and readiness to volunteer (41, 59). Female students were more likely than male students to volunteer in pandemic control (60.2 vs. 52.3%). This finding is consistent with previous research, which found that women were more inclined to volunteer because of their nurturing, generous, and empathetic nature, but for a shorter period than male participants (60, 61). Moreover, health professional students with high prosocial motivation were more likely to engage in volunteer behavior during a pandemic crisis (42). This is in accordance with the findings from the previous studies that showed that increases of prosocial motivation lead to increases in either work or volunteering behavior (62).
Most of the students indicated that volunteering activities provided direct benefits such as gaining a sense of giving direct aid, building professional experience, and developing collaboration skills (7). This may be due to health-related activities influencing health professional students to contribute (63). These findings are consistent with the previous studies (64-66). Thus, giving motivation to the health professional students to contribute as volunteers in this pandemic era became crucial. Another advantage of volunteering is that it helped prevent mental-health problems during this uncertain time. Volunteering was also linked to improved mental wellbeing (67).
On the other hand, some barriers may be experienced by health professional students discouraging them from participating in volunteer work during COVID-19. Fear for their own health, the lack of a treatment, and the fear of

harming patients were key factors limiting their willingness to volunteer (41). Health profession students responded that their safety while working was a priority (45). As a result, the regulation on this topic appears to be necessary as a prerequisite (7). Fostering volunteerism among medical students requires the joint effort of the government, non-profit organizations, hospitals, and medical colleges (42). Government and alllevel organizations should contribute to create extensive job opportunities and platforms for medical students to generate volunteer services, as well as to build a sustainable incentive system to encourage medical students to engage in volunteer behavior to serve society (42). Training and education were related to update the safety recommendations (68). Hospitals should give the training sessions and theoretical prequalification before health professional students start activity in volunteering (45). The university should provide clear protocols and guidance for volunteering activities (45). Senior colleagues should further address and support safety during clinical work (45).
Health professional students can undertake many activities to contribute in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nine studies included in this review assessed the form of activities that health professional students undertook to fight the pandemic. The activities can be broadly divided into nine different categories, defined as direct patient care (7, 25, 27, 46), call center and administration (7, 27, 39, 46), epidemiological aspects (22, 47, 48), online consultation (46- 49), laboratory-related works (47), equipment supply (27, 39), mentoring juniors (39), health promotion and education (48), and in research programs (8). Some students also reported being involved in more than one type of volunteering activity, such as in patient's triage and admission wards (7, 39). This is important in increasing public knowledge and awareness, supporting healthcare facilities, and evidence-based practice regarding the COVID-19 pandemic (7, 17, 69).
Our work provides an exclusive systematic review of volunteering activities undertaken by health profession students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The previous research, although also emphasizing volunteerism and readiness in the case of a pandemic, is mainly tracked back to past scenarios, therefore, explaining different pandemic or disaster situations. Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we evaluated the determining factors, types of activities, and advantages of volunteering (which was exclusively done in this systematic review). Moreover, this study employed a larger population of health professional students (medical and other healthcare professions) than previous research (only inclusive of medical students) (70).
Although the majority of medical students were willing to voluntarily support the care system during the pandemic, only a small proportion of them had adequate readiness to practice (41). This is in agreement with the findings of previous research in Germany, which revealed relatively

low degrees of practice preparedness (58). This means that further preparations are required to ensure that they have sufficient knowledge and skills (57). The experience of volunteer service and the impact on healthcare students' life were identified (71). They were able to work for a longer period, more hours in addition to displaying a higher level of satisfaction and confidence, and when given adequate encouragement and valued by medical staff (46, 63). Volunteering activity can provide the opportunity to learn and practice skills in collaboration, communication, and health systems' science (22).
There are some limitations found in this systematic review. The number of samples was highly variable (the smallest was 12, and the largest was more than 10,000). The study with a small sample size may not represent all health professional students. Moreover, many studies had a moderate risk of bias due to their cross-sectional design (attributed to insufficient observation) and lack of confounder adjustment. The heterogeneity of the outcome measures changed the pattern of this review. Due to large geographical distribution, there may be cultural disparities among them, although it is helpful to picture a global phenomenon of volunteering in health professional students. The scope of this review is broad enough because it discusses the motivation and barriers to the willingness of health professional students to volunteer, the types of volunteering activities that health professional students can undertake, and the impact of volunteering on their future lives. We also developed a proposed model of volunteering activity in health professional students to summarize the findings (Figure 4).

Conclusion
The review findings highlight the affecting factors, types of activity, benefits, and obstacles of undertaking a volunteering role by health professional students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the motivation and barriers to the willingness of health professional students to volunteer and the impact of volunteering activities on their future lives is a key for supporting them. Additional studies with larger sample sizes, equal sample distribution, and with adjustment of confounders related to COVID-19 volunteering by health professional students are needed.

Abstract An online cross-sectional study was carried out to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among primary health care providers (PHPs) at three tertiary care hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan. Data was collected via email and online social media platforms. Statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 25.0 was used for data analysis. Among the total participants (n=114), 74 (66.7%) were male and 37 (33.3%) were female. The mean scores for knowledge, attitude and practice were 12.7±0.89, 8.9±4.1 and 7.3±1.2, respectively. Most of the participants knew the term COVID-19 and its mode of transmission (90%), signs and symptoms (84%) and risk factors (72%) associated with it. Most of the participants agreed that COVID-19 can be transmitted through coughing and sneezing (74.3%) and 84.6% were in favor that COVID-19 can be prevented by adopting preventive measures. Around 68.8% of the participants disagreed with the use of antibiotics in the prevention of COVID-19. Ninety percent of the respondents were avoiding close contact with the people having cough and flu-like symptoms. Most PHPs had good knowledge, positive attitude and reasonable practices regarding COVID-19. Moreover, focused training programs for PHPs at the Government level can further improve their understanding of risks and preventive strategies related to COVID-19, which will help them to provide appropriate care to their patients as well as to protect themselves from this infection.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the emerging respiratory disease that is caused by a novel coronavirus. It was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [1, 2]. The main clinical symptoms of this highly infectious disease

include fever, dry cough, fatigue, myalgia and shortness of breath. The advanced stage of COVID-19 is characterized by respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, bleeding and coagulation dysfunction [3, 4].
Since, December 2019, the COVID-19 has spread from Wuhan city to other cities of China and ultimately around the whole world [1, 5]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30th January 2020 and a pandemic on 11th March 2020. To date (9th April, 2020), there are 1.4 million laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the world and 85,582 deaths have been associated with it [6].
It has been reported that around 209 countries are affected due to COVID-19 in the world [5]. Pakistan is also been hit by this infection and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases are increasing by every passing day. According to the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination (MoNHSRC) the confirmed cases of COVID-19 till

6th April 2020 were 4601 and the associated deaths were 66. The laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province were 620 and 22 deaths have been reported with it. In comparison with other provinces of Pakistan (death rates: Sindh 1.86%, Punjab 0.7%, Balochistan 0.4%), KPK ranks at first position regarding the associated death with (death rate of 3.4%) COVID-19 [7]. The Government of Pakistan has taken unprecedented measures to control the COVID-19 spread in Pakistan. These measures include, suspension of public transportation services, the closing of schools and universities and implementation of general lockdown in the country along with special measures to isolate the infected and suspected cases [7, 8].

The battle against COVID-19 is still ongoing in Pakistan. In order to achieve success against the spread of COVID-19, the adherence to the control measures by the Primary Health Providers (PHPs) and the public are very important. The knowledge, attitude and practices of the PHPs towards COVID-19 infection will play a vital role in controlling this pandemic [1, 9].
Aims
To facilitate the management and control of COVID-19 in Pakistan, there is an urgent need to understand the awareness of PHPs regarding COVID-19. In this study, we have

Fever, sore throat, cough and shortness of breath are possible K4 symptoms of COVID-19 infection K4. The novel coronavirus is a similar virus as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV K5. The novel coronavirus is a similar virus as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV K6. Is the COVID-19 infection the same illness as flu or cold? K7. Is there any laboratory test to confirm the presence of COVID-19 infection? K8. The incubation period of COVID-19 infection is 1-2 weeks? K9. Can COVID-19 infection be caught from a person who presents no symptoms and has recently visited the affected
area? K10. People with a compromised immune system and old age people are at more risk of developing the infection? K11. Patients with comorbidities are at more risk of developing the infection K12. Health care workers and hospitalized patients who are near to infected patients are at more risk of developing the
infection K13. People in crowded places are at increased risk of getting affected by the disease K14. Patients of COVID-19 infection should be immediately isolated to avoid the transfer of infection to other people A1. The disease can be transmitted by coughing and sneezing A2. Transmission of COVID-19 infection can be prevented through wearing masks A3. Transmission of COVID-19 infection can be prevented through washing hands and face regularly with antiseptics
and sanitizers A4. Transmission of COVID-19 infection can be prevented through the isolation of COVID-19 infected patients A5. Transmission of COVID-19 infection can be prevented by taking antibiotics A6. Restricting the travel of COVID-19 infected people to other areas of the world and of people in other areas to
affected areas can be beneficial to prevent the spread of the infection A7. Avoiding touching nose, mouth and eyes can reduce the risk of infection A8. Avoiding touching the surface of doors, furniture or other things can be helpful in preventing the disease A9. If a vaccine is developed against the novel coronavirus, it can significantly reduce the epidemic spread A10. The available information about COVID-19 disease is sufficient in Pakistani society A11.

investigated the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of PHPs towards COVID-19 in three tertiary care hospitals of Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan.
Methods
Study Design and Settings
A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March 15 to April 4, 2020 in three tertiary care hospitals, named as Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC), Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH) and Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), located in Peshawar, Pakistan.
Ethical Approval and Consent to Participate
This research involved online data collection from the participants. Every participant gave an online informed consent before filling the study questionnaire. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Department of Pharmacy Practice, Bahauddin Zakariya University (BZU), Multan (reference number Acad/21/20/11).
Measuring Instrument
A self-administered questionnaire was developed and validated in a pilot study of 22 participants. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the developed questionnaire was 0.76, which indicates acceptable internal consistency. This questionnaire consisted of four parts as shown in Table 1. The first part was regarding demographics including age, gender, occupation, residence, and workplace. The second part comprised of 14 questions regarding COVID-19 knowledge (K1-K14, Table 1). Each question had three possible answers, yes/no and "I don't know". The total knowledge score ranged from 0 to 14. A mean knowledge score10 represent good knowledge. A correct response was assigned 1 point and incorrect/ I don't know was assigned 0 points. The third part comprised of 11 questions regarding attitude toward COVID-19 (A1-A11, Table 1). These questions were answered on 3-point Likert Scale (disagree, neutral and agree) and a mean score equal or less than 11 was associated with a positive attitude. The final part was regarding prevention practices associated with COVID-19 and were answered on some time, often and never basis (P1-P9, Table 1). A mean score equal to or less than 8 was an indicator of good preventive practices and a score greater than 8 was associated with poor preventive practices.

Data Collection
The questionnaire was developed using Google Docs (Google LLC. USA) and its online link was shared with the PHPs through email and via online social media. The questionnaire contained a brief introduction to the background, objective, procedures, voluntary nature of participation, declarations of anonymity and confidentiality, and the notes for filling in the questionnaire.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 25.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY) was used to analyze the data. Descriptive statistics including frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation were used to describe sample characteristics, level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Chi-square test (2) was used for categorical variables and for scale variables, student t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used.

Results
A total of 114 participants completed the survey, amongst which 74(66.7%) were male and 37(33.3%) were female. The mean age (±standard deviation) of the participants was 26.0±2.0 (range: 22-33). Ninety-two (82.1%) respondents were having a bachelor or master's degree. Most of the participants were un-married 71(63.4%) and most of the respondents were from HMC 65(57.5%). Other demographics characteristics are shown in Table 2.
The participants of the survey had a good overall knowledge of COVID-19. The mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 12.7±0.89 (range: 0-14) showing that 90.7% of participants had knowledge about the COVID-19. Knowledge score was significantly different across the professions (p=0.003), and hospitals (p=0.007). The knowledge scores of PHPs regarding COVID-19 can be seen in Table 3. Almost 90% of the participants knew the term COVID-19 and its mode of transmission. Most of the participants knew the signs and symptoms (84%) and risk factors (72%) associated with COVID-19. The results related to the participant's knowledge can be seen in Table 4.
The majority of the respondents showed a positive attitude towards COVID-19 infection. Their mean score was

Journal of Community Health (2021) 46:441-449
8.9±4.1, suggesting that 90% of the respondents had a positive attitude toward the COVID-19 infection as shown in Table 3. Most of the participant agreed that COVID-19 can be transmitted through coughing and sneezing (74.3%) and can be prevented by, wearing a mask (88.3%), washing hands (81.7%), isolating the infected patient (95%), restricting travel to infected areas (85.6%) and avoiding touching nose, eyes, and mouth (97.3%). Concerning the use of the antibiotics in the prevention of COVID-19, around 2% of respondents were in its favor and 68.8% were against the statement as shown in Table 5. The attitude toward COVID19 significantly differed with age (p<0.0001), marital status (p=0.0001), profession (p<0.0001), hospital (p=0.02) and residential place (p=0.001) (Table 3).
The mean practice score of PHPs toward COVID-19 was 7.3±1.2, which suggested that overall COVID-19 preventive practices were good. Most of the respondents were, eating thoroughly cooked food, keeping themselves warm and hydrated, avoiding close contact with the people having cough and flu-like symptoms and wearing personal protective equipment during interaction with COVID-19 patients. Most of the participants were taking care of proper hand hygiene before and after interaction with COVID-19 patients. Almost 100% practiced social distancing of one

meter from patients and other healthcare workers (Table 6). There was a significant difference across the age (p<0.0001) educational level (p=0.001), hospital (p=0.04) and residence (p=0.02) of the participants as shown in Table 3.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study in Pakistan that has assessed the KAP of PHPs toward the COVID-19 infection. The participants of this study had good overall knowledge about COVID-, as we found an overall correct response rate of 90.7% on the knowledge questionnaire. The knowledge score was significantly different across the professions (p=0.003) and the hospitals (p=0.007). Most of the respondents showed an optimistic attitude toward COVID19. The mean attitude score suggested that 80% of the respondents had a positive attitude toward the COVID-19 infection. The attitude toward COVID-19 significantly differed across the age (p<0.0001), profession (p<0.0001) and hospital (p=0.02). Despite this, the PHPs adopted good preventive practices regarding COVID-19. The mean practice score of 7.3±1.2, suggested that the preventive practices regarding COVID-19 among the PHPs were acceptable.
Knowledge greatly reflects the practice of individuals as it provides a base for good practice [10]. The knowledge of PHPs regarding COVID-19 is of paramount importance as they are on the frontline in dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak. The Physicians, Pharmacists, and Nurses are the professionals who are in direct contact with the COVID19 infected patients and they must be fully aware of the associated risks with this infection. In the presented study the correct knowledge response rate was 90%, this finding was consistent with studies conducted in China (90%) [1] and Kenya (88%) [9], but was higher than that of Jordon (40%) [11]. One study from China reported that 89.5% of the participants knew COVID-19 which was in line with our study [12]. The knowledge of the Iranian general population about COVID-19 was 87% which is consistent with our study [13]. Another study from China reported that 88% of the healthcare workers knew COVID-19 (knowledge score: 8.17±1.30), this finding was in line with our study [14].

The present study demonstrated that most of the respondents showed a positive attitude toward COVID-19. Almost 80-90% of the respondents agreed that infection can be prevented by wearing masks, washing hands, using sanitizer and soap, restricting travel to infected areas, isolation of infected patients and avoiding touching nose, eyes, and mouth, which was consistent with studies reported from China (94%) [1] and Iran (90%) [13]. Another study from China stated that 93.3% of the participant agreed with the statements that COVID-19 transmission can be prevented by washing hands with soap frequently, isolation of COVID-19 positive patients and acceptance of isolation after getting COVID-19 (attitude score: 1.86±0.43, range: 1-4) which was in line with our findings [14].
The adaption of preventive practices is the only solution to defeat the COVID-19, as to date, there is no specific treatment and prevention for the novel coronavirus [15]. In the present study preventive practice adopted by the PHPs were appreciable. The majority of respondents often practiced thoroughly cooked food (92%), keeping themselves warm and hydrated (69.6%), avoiding close contact with the people having cough and flu like symptoms (76%) and wearing personal protective equipment during interaction with COVID-19 patients (88.4%). Most of the participants had performed hand hygiene before and after interaction with COVID-19 patients (99.1%). Almost 100% practiced social distance of one meter from patients and other healthcare workers. This figure was consistent with the reported studies from China, where 96% of the respondents were practiced preventive practices by avoiding crowded places and wearing masks [1] and Jordon, where 87.5% of the participants adopted preventive practice by washing hands with alcohol or soap, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and putting a mask on confirmed or suspected patients [11]. Another study from Iran reported that 89% of the participants practiced preventive measures regarding COVID-19 (mean±SD: 32.1±2.9, range: 12-36) these numbers are consistent with our study [13]. The good PHPs practices seen in this study may be attributed to the various directives issued by the Government Agencies and by the awareness campaigns ran on the social and electronic media.

Conclusion
The findings from the current study suggested that PHPs have good knowledge, optimistic attitude and reasonable practices regarding COVID-19 infection. Moreover, focused training programs for PHPs can improve the understanding of risk and preventive strategies related to COVID-19 infection, which in turn can improve the confidence of PHPs to provide appropriate care to their patients as well as to protect themselves from this infection.

Abstract Implications for the academic and interpersonal development of children and adolescents underpin a global political consensus to maintain in-­classroom teaching during the ongoing COVID-­19 pandemic. In support of this aim, the WHO and UNICEF have called for schools around the globe to be made safer from the risk of COVID-­19 transmission. Detailed guidance is needed on how this goal can be successfully implemented in a wide variety of educational settings in order to effectively mitigate impacts on the health of students, staff, their families, and society. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of current scientific evidence and emerging standards in relation to the use of layered prevention strategies (involving masks, distancing, and ventilation), setting out the basis for their implementation in the school environment. In the presence of increasingly infectious SARS-­Cov-­2 variants, in-­classroom teaching can only be safely maintained through a layered strategy combining multiple protective measures. The precise measures that are needed at any point in time depend

upon a number of dynamic factors, including the specific threat-­level posed by the circulating variant, the level of community infection, and the political acceptability of the resultant risk. By consistently implementing appropriate prophylaxis measures, evidence shows that the risk of infection from in-­classroom teaching can be dramatically reduced. Current studies indicate that wearing high-­quality masks and regular testing are amongst the most important measures in preventing infection transmission; whilst effective natural and mechanical ventilation systems have been shown to reduce infection risks in classrooms by over 80%.

1 | INTRODUCTION
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) "The [COVID-­19] pandemic has caused the most catastrophic disruption to education in history."1 As a result, educational and governmental authorities have become increasingly aware of the widespread nature of poor indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in classrooms, which epidemiologists, public health experts, and building services engineers have been sounding warnings over for decades.2-­4 Despite appeals by both the WHO and UNICEF for schools to be made safer, by adopting measures to minimize transmission of the SARS-­CoV-­2 virus, there has been little progress, by way of a coherent transnational directives, on how this should be achieved. Part of the reason that decisive action to reduce transmission in schools has been delayed may be because the factors influencing the nature of indoor transmission of SARS-­CoV-­2 were poorly understood initially, and the role of aerosol transmission was downplayed.5 It was not until 30 April 2021, more than 12months after first declaring COVID-­19 a pandemic, that the WHO formally acknowledged that the virus was airborne.6 Whilst more than 2years into the pandemic, on 23 March 2022, the U.S. White House announced for the first time that "the most common way COVID-­19 is transmitted from one person to another is through tiny airborne particles of the virus hanging in indoor air."7
Overwhelming evidence of continued widespread disruption to the education of hundreds of millions of students worldwide8 coupled with the mental health, wellbeing, economic, and social impacts associated with lockdowns and school closures,9,10 has underscored the importance of decisive action to reduce in-­school transmission. Gurdasani et al.11 argue that mass infection is not an option since it risks leaving an entire generation with chronic health problems and disabilities, compounded by long-­term personal and economic impacts.
It was established, during the Delta outbreak (using cluster tracing and calibrated agent-­based epidemiological models), that the control of SARS-­CoV-­2 spread in schools (as defined by R <1) requires a combination of more than one preventive measure.12,13 Understanding modes of transmission and their relative importance, in any given context, is therefore central to the implementation of effective public health interventions (Appendix S1).14 In

Practical Implications · Natural, mechanical, and hybrid ventilation strategies, to
reduce the risk of infection with SARS-­CoV-­2 in school classrooms, are evaluated in the context of international standards and emerging guidelines. · The need to maintain masking protocols to address short-­  and long-­range transmission risks indoors is explored, alongside evidence of the acceptability of masking in schools. · Strategies to reduce the risks of cross-­infection arising from respiratory jets and from directed air currents, resulting from ventilation and purification strategies, are discussed. · Guidance on the use of CO2 sensors as proxy indicators of indoor air quality in classrooms is provided, alongside the evidence for, and constraints to, further reducing threshold limiting values. · Recommendations for additional air cleaning strategies are provided, with particular attention given to the strengths and limitations of using mobile air purifiers.
support of this aim, the paper presented here provides a synthesis of up-­to-­date scientific information on the role of (1) physical distancing, (2) masks, and (3) ventilation and air purification as critical elements in the creation of a multi-­layered prophylaxis strategy for schools and educational buildings. The work is intended to update, synthesize, and supplement previously published findings and reviews.15,16,17,18

"schools", and "ventilation" for articles published in English up to June 12, 2022. We included abstracts and reports from meetings only if they related directly to previously published work. We found 2035 articles related to the transmission of COVID-­19 in a wide range of settings. We then filtered these results to include only those that focused on COVID-­19 `prevention', which yielded 1606 results. We then included articles if they provided evidence to support the use of individual or multiple prophylaxis measures to prevent or reduce the transmission of COVID-­19 in schools and similar educational contexts. In addition to the PubMed publications, we also included articles from the German Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt) on topics related to ventilation and COVID-­19 prophylaxis in schools.
3 | PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND MASKS
A number of studies have attempted to define a safe physical distance from direct transmission on the basis of the furthest distance that droplets produced by coughing can reach. The results of such studies show that environmental parameters, in particular air speed and direction, can play a significant role in influencing the distance which respiratory droplets can travel.19,20,21 Using a modified version of the Wells-­Riley model, Sun and Zhai22 determined that the minimum safe distance for regular social activities (e.g. breathing and talking) indoors was 1.6-­3 m; however, they note that occupant density, ventilation rate and effectiveness, and exposure time have a marked influence on infection probability. Moreover, in the absence of masks, it has been shown that large droplets can be transported more than 2 m by coughing and over 6 m by sneezing, under typical room temperature and humidity conditions (20 °C; 50% RH).23,24 Meta-­analysis, involving over 200 observational and comparative studies, confirms that effective protection against direct infections is provided by physical distancing (of 1 m or more) and the consistent wearing of quality-­assured face masks (at least surgical masks or medical grade mouth-­nose protection [MNP])25 along with consistent hand hygiene.
The risk of indirect infection is also significantly reduced by wearing masks, with FFP2/N95 (and FFP3/N99) grade masks being particularly effective against aerosol transmission.26,27 Cross-­sectional studies show that communities with high reported mask-­wearing and physical distancing have the highest predicted probability of transmission control.28 Other measures, such as ventilation or mobile air purifiers, do not obviate the need to wear masks during the pandemic; rather they serve to provide an additional layer of protection against indirect infections. Moreover, research shows that the efficacy of masks is non-­linear and is highly dependent on the airborne viral concentration in the room air. Using direct measurements of SARS-­CoV-­2 in air samples and population-­level infection probabilities, Cheng et al.26 determined that the viral load in most environments is sufficiently low for masks to be effective in reducing airborne transmission. To

achieve this benefit, masks must always be worn correctly, that is, completely covering the mouth and nose and fitting as tightly as possible (i.e. without air gaps at the perimeter).
Masks should be worn by everyone during classroom teaching, including, as far as possible, the teachers, because speaking frequently and loudly accounts for a particularly large proportion of the respiratory droplet and aerosol emissions in a room.29,30 The consequences of an unmasked teacher reading in class whilst in an infectious state were clearly illustrated in the COVID-­19 outbreak at an elementary school in Marin County, California (May 2021) where the attack rate in the front two rows (closest to the teachers desk) was 80% and in the back three rows 28%.13 For practical reasons and to minimize any negative effects on the teaching activities, teachers could alternate between wearing surgical masks and FFP2/N95 masks, depending on the specific needs of an activity and the applicable regulations.
Despite media controversy and false reporting,31 there is little data attesting to adverse effects from mask wearing in children, and when used appropriately, they are not expected.32 Moreover, research suggests that children actually tolerate mask wearing better than their parents realize.33 During school breaks, the students should be encouraged to spend time outdoors, where they can safely remove their masks. Masks should still be required in transit zones (hallways, stairwells etc.) as well as in washrooms and other confined indoor spaces. There is no evidence that mandatory masking has exerted a negative effect on social distancing between individuals when queuing or in crowded spaces; on the contrary, evidence shows that masks appear to serve as a signal to increase distancing.34 Appropriate break times outdoors should be observed because the continuous wearing of surgical masks (and even more so tightly fitting FFP2/N95 masks) can be perceived as a physiological strain.
Extrapolating such findings to the outdoor setting is challenging, Rowe et al.35 developed a simplified analytical model to compare the relative level of exposure occurring between comparable (in terms of occupant density) outdoor and indoor settings. Their findings confirm that the risk of indirect transmission outdoors is typically orders of magnitude lower than that of indoors; however, they note that situations of temperature inversion and low wind speeds (i.e. those which commonly exacerbate atmospheric pollution) could result in levels of outdoor transmission close to those indoors, especially in crowded spaces.35 On the basis of these findings, it can be inferred that outside the school building (e.g. in the schoolyard), masks do not typically need to be worn provided sufficient distance is maintained (min. 1.5m). Conversely, when in close proximity outdoors (i.e. <1.5 m), masks should also be worn, to avoid direct infections; for this purpose, simple mouth-­nose coverings are sufficient.
Physical distancing should be maintained both indoors and outdoors to reduce the risks of direct transmission. The primary function served by the wearing of face masks (i.e. source control) cannot be replaced by distancing, ventilation, or air purification measures.

4 | VENTIL ATION AND AIR PURIFICATION
4.1 | Enhancing measures against indirect infections
Morawska and Milton argue that although people may think that they are fully protected by adhering to the current recommendations, "in fact, additional airborne interventions are needed for further reduction of infection risk."36 In support of this assertion, evidence is now emerging from large cohort studies carried out in European schools, confirming the extent to which ventilation is able to reduce SARS-­CoV-­2 transmission in classrooms.37,38 A consistent finding from such studies is that increasing ventilation rates has a significant impact on reducing the risk of infection, with in-­ classroom transmission reduced by over 80% in one study, where six air changes per hour (ACH) were used.38 Moreover, in addition to the well-­documented effect on long-­range transmission39,40,41 there is emerging evidence that room ventilation rates significantly affect short-­range airborne transmission.42
Studies have shown that classroom CO2 monitoring and teacher education are vital to ensure that teachers understand how and when to ventilate appropriately during the pandemic.43 In well-­ mixed spaces, CO2 serves as a reliable scalar for the ambient air flow; however, it should be noted that aerosolized pathogens are subject to additional removal mechanisms, including filtration (e.g. by face masks, filtration devices and internal circulation), sedimentation, and deactivation. Therefore, the concentration of CO2 cannot be taken as an absolute measure of the SARS-­COV-­2 concentration or the risk of infection since this is also dependent on the probability that an infector is (or was) in the room and on the duration of exposure.44 As such, COVID-­19 indoor safety guidelines can be broadly expressed in terms of cumulative exposure to CO2 under the assumption that an infected person is present in the room.44,45
The sensor should ideally be wall-­mounted at seated head height and not located directly adjacent to an open window or too close to the occupants.46 The lower the CO2 concentration in the classroom is, above the ambient air value (approx. 415-­450ppm), the lower the

respiratory aerosol exposure and associated indirect infection risks will be. From the point of view of indoor hygiene and viral transmission risks in a typical classroom (where masks are worn), a CO2 value of 1000ppm should not be exceeded on average over a teaching hour.47,48 This value can be achieved, for example, by commencing purge-­ventilation whenever the CO2 concentration reaches approximately 1200ppm CO2 until it falls below approximately 800ppm CO2.
Such values were determined early in the pandemic, however, and on the basis of increased transmission with new (Omicron) variants, Rowe et al.49 propose that CO2 thresholds of 800ppm (when masked) and 600ppm (when unmasked) represent more appropriate targets. For practical reasons, maintaining such values may be difficult or impossible year-­round in many existing naturally and mechanically ventilated classrooms since a CO2 reduction from 1000 to 600ppm implies approximately a threefold increase in the ventilation rate, in a typical classroom. In wintertime, maintaining thermal comfort at such high ventilation rates will carry a substantial energetic penalty. For this reason, strategies providing a base level of ventilation augmented by additional room-­based air purification methods (Section 4.6) may be preferable.
Ventilation rates only influence the dilution of suspended particles, and it is important to acknowledge that there can be orders of magnitude difference in the emission rates of aerosols entering a room according to activity levels, masking compliance, and a number of other factors.50 It should also be noted that in the absence of masks, respiratory jets from the occupants are likely to pose a substantially greater risk than the well-­mixed ambient air. For this reason, ventilation systems and air purifiers cannot obviate the need for masking and physical distancing.50,51
Although natural ventilation has been successfully used to mitigate various airborne epidemics historically,52,53 it is not always the most effective or acceptable solution in every educational setting. Comfortable internal temperatures can be difficult to maintain using openable windows when the outside air temperature falls below 6 °C.54 Therefore, the selection of the most appropriate ventilation prophylaxis measure(s) for a specific room or zone within an

MCLEOD et al.
educational building depends on a number of factors. These include consideration of the functional characteristics of the room being assessed, the occupancy patterns, and the presence or absence of existing natural and mechanical ventilation systems. Figure 1 provides a schematic flowchart to guide this selection process. A detailed commentary of the relevant issues pertaining to each ventilation (or air cleaning method) is provided in the corresponding sub-­sections.
4.2 | Air distribution pattern in rooms
School classrooms are usually rectangular, with air volumes typically in the range of 100-­300m3. During lessons, students and teachers typically remain in fixed places, so the occupant dynamics are low. Under these conditions, the risk of infection can be plausibly estimated using models that assume complete mixing of the air.55 However, there are situations that cause directed air flows which cannot be described by such general models. These include speaking loudly,56,57 coughing, and sneezing.58 In addition, room-­specific conditions including the type of ventilation system, the temperature of the surrounding surfaces, and the locations of individuals can have large effects on the localized distribution of aerosols.59 For example, it has been shown that exhaled air jets can travel further in rooms using displacement ventilation than in those using natural or mechanical mixing ventilation.60
In naturally ventilated classrooms, incoming airflows (generated from an open window) in line with a row of seated occupants, have been shown to increase the risk of infection transmission when an infected individual is seated near to the window.59 This risk can be mitigated by using a baffle inside the open window to direct the incoming air downward to the floor, before it enters the breathing zone, which can also help reduce cold draughts during the cooler months.61 Speaking is known to generate large amounts of aerosols, and opening one or two windows next to the teacher has been proven to facilitate the rapid exit of these particles.62
Studies of mechanical ventilated classrooms show that aerosol distributions are strongly influenced by the system design and layout. Properly designed displacement ventilation systems promote vertical stratification (Appendix S3, Figure A2), allowing the warm contaminated air to be removed above the breathing zone of the occupants. In contrast, mixing ventilation distributes the air throughout the space and does not provide any potentially clean zones.63 A common finding in mechanical systems is that infectious particles disperse in the room and re-­concentrate around the return ducts and filtration unit inlets.64,65 One study, using a CFD model of a displacement ventilation system, showed that students in the back corners of the room received two to three times less particles on average than most other students in the room.65 Such findings are difficult to generalize but highlight the benefits of computationally modeling spatial flows as a means of evaluating the optimal placement of inlet and outlet diffusers, as well as the positioning of portable room filtration units.65,66

4.3 | Air Handling Units (AHUs) and room ventilation systems
Air Handling Units (AHUs) and simple room-­based ventilation systems can be used to provide a continuous air exchange and replace stale indoor air, enriched with carbon dioxide (CO2) and respiratory aerosols, with fresh outdoor air. This can be achieved without necessitating the opening of windows or user interference. In view of the pandemic, the proportion of outside air should typically be set as high as possible.67 However, several studies have cautioned that raising ventilation rates in response to the COVID-­19 pandemic requires careful analysis of the growth in energy consumption to ensure indoor comfort conditions are maintained.68,69,70 Current international standards vary in regard to what is considered an appropriate fresh air supply rate for classrooms. In the US, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-­Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standard 62.1-­201971 recommends 5 L/(sperson) for classrooms and other educational facilities, while European standards (ISO 17772 1:2017, EN 16798 1:2019)72,73 recommend an air flow rate of at least 7 L/(sperson).
According to EN 16798-­1:2019,73 there are three possible methods which may be used to determine the airflow rate per person. For example, using EN 16798-­1 Method 1, one must account for the design ventilation rate per person plus the design ventilation rate for diluting emissions from the building itself. So, assuming one is designing to meet a normal (i.e. `medium') level of occupant expectation (i.e. Category II targets, using Method 1), then 7 L/(sperson)+ 0.7 L/ (sm2) is needed if it is a low-­emitting building. Assuming there is typically one student per 3 m2 (of internal floor area), the fresh air requirement equates to 9.1 L/(sperson), that is, circa 33m3/(hperson). The lower recommendation, here, of 25m3/(hperson) represents a pro-­rata adjustment for children and adolescents, but on no account should this value be further reduced.
It should be noted that the abovementioned ventilation standards were conceived prior to the COVID-­19 pandemic and should therefore be interpreted as the minimum permissible ventilation requirements. In the context of COVID-­19, findings regarding optimal ventilation rates for infection prophylaxis vary considerably. Research by Dai and Zhao, using the Wells-­Riley equation, showed that ventilation rates an order of magnitude higher than existing European standards recommend are needed to ensure an infection probability of <1%.74 Pollozhani et al.,69 using a modified version of the Lelieveld model,75 demonstrated that increased ventilation rates would continue to reduce infection rates if applied at levels beyond those currently specified in European and international standards. In contrast, recent research, using a simplified model of occupant-­ exhaled pollutants, suggests that a ventilation rate of 10 L/(sperson), in line with current recommendations proposed by the WHO, provides a similar viral concentration vs distance decay profile to that found in outdoor settings.42 This finding should be treated cautiously since it is based on a theoretical room with a negligible pressure gradient and a simplified steady-­state jet model of expired aerosols.76

MCLEOD et al.

The implications of infectious organisms being recirculated in school ventilation systems were first highlighted almost 50years ago during a measles outbreak in an elementary school in upstate New York.77 In situations where an AHU uses recirculated air, this must be effectively filtered78 either by using HEPA-­grade filters (E10 to H14 according ISO 29463-­179) or by combining coarser filter classes ISO ePM1 (50) and ePM1 (80), (commonly referred to as F7 and F9 filters). Filter upgrades should be undertaken in collaboration with an HVAC professional to ensure the AHU is able to overcome the additional pressure drop induced by the new filters. Properly installed, maintained, and operated air-­handling systems can effectively reduce the risk of indirect infections and provide good indoor air quality and comfort beyond the pandemic (Appendix S3). Currently, however, only about 1 in 10 European schools possess dedicated air-­handling systems.80
4.4 | Natural ventilation (via openable windows)
A simple and easily implemented means of removing respiratory aerosol and airborne viruses from indoor spaces can be provided by the use of openable windows (i.e. natural ventilation). Natural ventilation remains the most widely used ventilation method in European school buildings.80,81
Purge ventilation is a manually controlled process, whereby rooms are ventilated at a relatively high rate to rapidly dilute pollutants and refresh the stale indoor air. This can be achieved by opening the windows fully and should take place in classrooms at a 20-­min interval (or less) for about 5 min' duration during the pandemic. Purge ventilation should also take place during breaks between classes (e.g. using the 20-­5-­20 rule).67,82 Ventilating only during the breaks is insufficient to maintain the hygienic targets (CO2 concentration) compatible with COVID-­19 prophylaxis.83
An empirical monitoring study of a naturally ventilated Korean classroom demonstrated that using continuous ventilation with a reduced opening area (ratio of the opened window area to the maximum openable window area) can be as effective as purge ventilation. In a double-­sided (i.e. cross-­ventilation) configuration, with a 15% opening area, it was possible (even during the summer months) to achieve 6.51 ACH (on average), while a single-­sided configuration, with a 30% opening area, yielded 3.28 ACH (on average). At these air-­change rates, it was determined that the infection probability in the classroom could be maintained at <1% and 2% (respectively) by restricting the exposure time to <3 h and wearing a mask.84
In practice, the duration of ventilation required for a complete effective air change is dependent upon the number, size, and position of the window openings as well as the building design and the outside temperature. In cold weather, air exchange generally takes place within a few minutes; thus, the duration of ventilation during lessons can be shortened (to approx. 2-­3min), which is advisable in order to minimize adverse effects on thermal comfort (Appendix S2). Only during warmer periods, when external air speeds are low and indoor and outdoor air temperatures are similar, is rapid air exchange

impaired. This can be countered by varying the length of purge ventilation periods across the day in accordance with the outside temperature. In summer, continuous ventilation (either through tilting bottom-­hung windows or by leaving side hung windows ajar) can help reduce respiratory aerosol exposure in addition to the use of intermittent purge ventilation.
Estimating natural air exchange rates (AERs) through window openings or via other means (ventilation grilles, passive ducts systems etc.) is an expert task which can be implemented using the formula provided in the European standard EN 16798-­7:2017,85 or in industry guidance documents such as CIBSE AM10.86 It should be noted that natural ventilation flow rates vary significantly not only from season-­to-­season but also from minute-­to-­minute in response to changing pressure differentials across ventilation openings and are typically higher the greater the temperature difference is between the internal and external air mass.87 For this reason, ventilation adequacy is most easily verified using a carbon dioxide (CO2) sensor to continuously monitor and display the CO2 concentration.63 This device should preferably incorporate (or be connected to) a display providing easily recognized visual alerts, such as a traffic light warning system, corresponding to defined CO2 thresholds (Section 4.1), indicating when windows need to be opened.88
Regular natural ventilation, which can be continuously verified by CO2 measurements, ensures effective removal of respiratory aerosols.
4.5 | Extract ventilation systems
Extract fans (sometimes referred to as exhaust fans) are well-­ established as a means to supplement natural ventilation in a variety of contexts, including occupational health and safety,82 and have previously been shown to decrease the concentration of indoor-­ generated pollutants in classrooms.89 When applied as a retrofit measure, they are typically installed on the inside of the windowpane, below the ceiling level, where they actively extract the polluted room air from the classroom, while at the same time, fresh make-­up air flows in passively from the outside, via an open window or inlet vent.
Extract fans reduce the indirect risk of infection by effectively removing respiratory aerosols and can also ensure good indoor air quality and a comfortable indoor environment beyond the pandemic. When used in conjunction with extract hoods located above the occupied zone of a classroom (Appendix S3, Figure A2) displacement (i.e. vertical laminar), airflows can be generated, thereby enhancing airborne viral extraction before it can circulate in the room.90,61 Moreover, studies have shown that the use of hybrid ventilation in conjunction with appropriate control strategies can result in considerable HVAC energy savings by using natural forces when they are sufficient, but with mechanical assistance when necessary.91,92 Extract fans can be retrofitted in naturally ventilated rooms at short notice and at relatively low cost.93 Installation must be carried out professionally, particularly with regard to the power supply and

controls, in the interests of avoiding accidents and fires. Depending on the targeted ventilation requirements and system dimensioning, extract fans can be run either intermittently or in continuous operation (Appendix S3).
Extract fans provide a well-­established means of maintaining the fresh air supply and ensuring the effective removal of respiratory aerosols year-­round.
4.6 | Mobile and room-­based air purifiers
Mobile air purifiers can also help reduce aerosol particle concentrations and thus indirect infection hazards. Curtius et al. showed that the aerosol concentration in a classroom was reduced by more than 90% within <30min when running four HEPA purifiers in tandem, with a clean air delivery rate (CADR) of 5.5 h-1.94 However, mobile air purifiers have the fundamental disadvantage that they do not lead to a renewal of the room air. They can, therefore, only serve as an additional supportive measure to reduce the aerosol-­borne risk of infection but cannot replace other measures such as ventilation and mask-­wearing.
In order for mobile air purifiers to be used, it is essential that their effectiveness, with regard to reducing virus contamination in a real room, is independently verified according to official standards, such as the German norm VDI EE 4300-­1495 (established under the direction of the German government to provide independent and verifiable measurement standards for mobile air purifiers). This is a critical point since Küpper et al. found that the CADRs in real settings can be significantly lower than those determined in standardized test chamber experiments, which they attributed to the differing size distributions between actual and standard test aerosols used in some international standards.96 In addition, air purifiers must be appropriately sized, properly set up, correctly installed, and operated,97 while a number of authors have emphasized the need to replace or clean the filters with a frequency higher than that indicated for ordinary use.97,98 Moreover, filters need to be disposed as medical waste, or thoroughly disinfected, to prevent secondary contamination.98 Similar to AHUs and extract fans, the operational noise pollution and draughts from mobile air purifiers must also be taken into account and kept to a minimum (Appendix S2).94
Mobile air purification units that do not remove viruses through filtration but inactivate them in the air (e.g. UV-­C irradiation, plasma field ionization, etc.) can also be considered. Accidental exposure is a major challenge for devices deploying conventional 254-­nm germicidal ultraviolet (GUV) light since it is known to cause sunburn-­type reactions, while long-­term exposure is linked to photocarcinogenesis.99 In contrast, research has shown that Far-­UVC (222nm) does not induce acute reactions in the skin or eyes nor delayed effects such as skin cancer and has been shown to efficiently inactivate the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.100 On the basis that previous studies, using a broad range of Far-­UVC wavelengths, have shown comparable surface inactivation of SARS-­COV-­2101 and airborne human coronaviruses (OC43 and 229E),102,103 it is likely that Far-­UVC will

also be proven effective against SARS-­CoV-­2. In the context of classrooms, UV-­C devices have the major advantage of being silent, but unlike mechanical systems with air filters, they do not lead to a reduction in fine dust pollution in the room. The use of UV-­C devices is not yet established in schools however, and it must be convincingly demonstrated that occupant exposure levels do not exceed the ICNIRP guideline limits.99 A further concern arises in relation to the photochemical activation of a wide range of molecules present in the indoor environment (e.g. VOCs) by UV-­C light, which could potentially cause health effects, even in low concentrations. Precise test specifications for UV-­C secondary units can be found in the German norm DIN-­TS 67506 TS104 and for other types of mobile air purifiers in VDI EE 430O-­1495 (for which there are currently no international standard counterparts). The use of independently tested air purifiers can help reduce the risk of indirect infections in classrooms with limited ventilation, for example, in Category 2 rooms (Appendix S4) as defined by the German Environment Agency.48 In practical terms, this applies to any room where the CO2 concentration cannot be significantly lowered (to 800ppm or below) within a short period of time even with the windows open. This includes rooms with restricted window openings and where windows are not opened regularly due to factors such as excessive external noise.48
Room sterilization via the nebulization of active ingredients such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is an established procedure for the disinfection of hospital operating theaters. These substances are strong oxidizing agents with correspondingly high electrochemical potential. In principle, such substances are suitable for use against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. However, the repeated use of mechanically nebulized H2O2 and HOCl in indoor rooms in which people live, work, and study is not established. The German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) have strongly advised against spraying these substances in normally occupied indoor spaces. The release of other oxidizing agents such as chlorine dioxide (ClO2), hydroxy radicals (OH), and ozone (O3) is also considered questionable. Uhde et al.105 conclude that such disinfection measures in occupied indoor spaces remain impractical, while harboring potentially serious health risks.
The operation of mobile air purifiers can significantly reduce transmission risks but does not replace the need to ventilate and wear masks in the classroom. Attention should be given to minimizing noise from filtration systems and to the risk of hazardous by-­ products arising from room sterilization systems.
4.7 | Intermittently occupied rooms and rooms without effective fresh air supply
Occupied rooms in school buildings in which there is no possibility of ventilation at all are not suitable for teaching and cannot comply with international standards for ventilation.71,73 Mobile air purifiers do not provide a suitable means of enabling the permanent use of these rooms. This is because mobile air purifiers, as described above,

16000668, 2022, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ina.13142 by MORGAN STATE UNIVERSITY, Wiley Online Library on [17/11/2022].

MCLEOD et al.

do not provide an exchange between the indoor and outdoor air, and consequently the general indoor air quality in the room will deteriorate over time as a function of the occupancy.
The situation is different in poorly ventilated corridors, storage rooms, and bathrooms that are only intermittently used. Here, retrofitted extract air systems or mobile air purifiers can help improve the situation. Special consideration should be given to bathrooms however since toilet flushing is known to facilitate the spread of pathogenic organisms, including SARS-­CoV-­2.106 In this regard, mitigation actions (including advice to use toilet lids when flushing) coupled with increased air flow rates (and/or additional air purification measures) are imperative.107
5 | CONCLUSION
By combining the above-­mentioned prophylactic measures to create a "layered strategy" and by consistently implementing and monitoring them, the risk of infection from classroom-­based teaching in schools can be significantly reduced. Evidence shows that mask wearing alongside social distancing and ventilation can create a strong trifecta effect in reducing both long-­ and short-­range infection risks inside classrooms. Ventilation methods that meet or exceed current international guidelines for the provision of fresh air and the removal of contaminants via natural or mechanical ventilation are fundamental to this approach, but their successful implementation requires continuous CO2 monitoring and due consideration to thermal and acoustic comfort criteria. Mobile air-­purifiers can significantly augment the benefits of ventilation, but they cannot replace the aforementioned trifecta. Emerging technologies such as Far-­UVC are likely to provide significant further prophylactic benefit once their safe deployment in classrooms has been established and have the added benefit of not increasing the heating demand.
The risk of infection changes with the introduced viral load and has to be reassessed regularly with regard to the general infection incidence and in relation to the emergence of new viral variants. Therefore, regular testing and contact tracing are needed to inform the appropriate implementation and fine-­tuning of the prophylaxis measures. The precise level of infection or morbidity risks which are considered acceptable, in the context of keeping schools open, must be continually re-­evaluated in relation to both the educational benefits and the wider impacts on society as a whole. The multi-­layered strategy of infection prophylaxis, presented here, can be readily adjusted in accordance with the overall effectiveness, compliance with the core protective measures (masks, ventilation, and distancing), and the need for additional measures such as testing, vaccination, and contact reduction.

Abstract SARS-­CoV-­2 has been detected both in air and on surfaces, but questions remain about the patient-­specific and environmental factors affecting virus transmission. Additionally, more detailed information on viral sampling of the air is needed. This prospective cohort study (N =56) presents results from 258 air and 252 surface samples from the surroundings of 23 hospitalized and eight home-­treated COVID-­19 index patients between July 2020 and March 2021 and compares the results between the measured environments and patient factors. Additionally, epidemiological and experimental investigations were performed. The proportions of qRT-­PCR-­positive air (10.7% hospital/17.6% homes) and surface samples (8.8%/12.9%) showed statistical similarity in hospital and homes. Significant SARS-­CoV-­2 air contamination was observed in a large (655.25m3) mechanically ventilated (1.67 air changes per hour, 32.4-­421L/s/patient) patient hall even with only two patients present. All positive air samples were obtained in the absence of aerosol-g­ enerating procedures. In four cases, positive environmental samples were detected after the patients had developed a neutralizing IgG response. SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA was detected in the following particle sizes: 0.65-­4.7 m, 7.0-­12.0 m, >10 m, and <100m. Appropriate infection control against airborne and surface transmission routes is needed in both environments, even after antibody production has begun.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Increasing scientific evidence indicates the dominance of short-­and long-­range airborne transmission of SARS-­CoV-­2.1-­6 The observed transmission risks have been higher indoors than outdoors,7 and discussion on precautions for hospital and home environments has been intense. In a study that aerosolized SARS-­CoV-­2 under laboratory conditions, aerosols' infectivity was retained for up to 16h,8 while another study estimated the half-­life in aerosols to be approximately 1.1-1­ .2 h (95% CI 0.64-­2.64).9 Outside of the laboratory, signs of viable SARS-­CoV-­2 in the air have been detected,10-­12 and the virus has also been cultured from exhaled air.13 A direct link between SARS-­CoV-­2 viral load, emission, and airborne concentration was recently demonstrated by Buonanno et al.14 A few studies have detected SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA in the air at home-­environment.15,16 In hospitals, PCR-­based studies have found SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA in room air,17-­25 as well as from air conditioning filters located over 50m from the patient room.26 Even though previous studies have mainly used long collection times or high flow rates, challenge is that only a proportion of the air present in a room can be analyzed. Additionally, indoor turbulence highly affects local concentrations.27,28 Thus, questions remain about the risk of infection during shorter meetings or in rooms with a larger air space, and whether the findings would be similar in the home environment. As environmental sampling is highly demanding and sample sizes rather small, more patient data are also needed to draw further conclusions in future systematic reviews.
According to laboratory studies, the stability of SARS-­CoV-­2 on surfaces varies depending on the surface type and environmental conditions.9,29-­32 However, its ability to sustain infectivity on surfaces outside laboratory conditions is largely unknown.33 SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA has been found, for example, on high-­touch surfaces, floors, and toilets,18,19,34,35 and there are a few possibly positive culture findings of SARS-­CoV-­2 from the surfaces.36-­38 The effect of age and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) on the spread of SARS-­CoV-­2 has been speculated,39-4­ 1 but there is a lack of clear evidence for the role of patient-­related factors.
This study sought to increase knowledge of SARS-­CoV-­2 transmission in different environments by analyzing air, surface, and patient samples from a COVID-­19 cohort ward in Helsinki University Hospital (HUS), Finland, and from patients' homes. The aims were to determine whether SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA or viable virus could be found in the home and hospital environments, and which patient-­and environment-­related factors affect the risk of environmental contamination. A team consisting of researchers from HUS, the University of Helsinki, the Finnish Meteorological Institute, and the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health was established to enable a multidisciplinary approach to the above research questions.

OKSANEN et al.
Practical implications · The finding of SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA from the air in the ab-
sence of aerosol generating procedures (AGP) and in the absence of respiratory symptoms emphasizes the use of respiratory protection and airborne precautions also in situations where AGPs are not performed and regardless of the patients' symptoms. · Families that used respiratory protection were able to prevent further infections. · Air and surface contamination was detected in both homes and hospital even though the day from the start of the symptoms was later in hospital measurements. This may follow from more severe disease and increased viral loads which were associated with older age. Infection control measures should be used in both environments to prevent further infections.
been observed to be highest in early disease, the patient with the most recent onset of symptoms was selected as the index patient,42 except for collection 13, where all the patients in the room had been symptomatic for over 10days and the patient with the freshest positive PCR result (P26) was selected (Table S1). Environmental measurements were performed in the vicinity of the index patients. Saliva samples were also collected from other patients who were in the ward at the same time and who agreed to the study in 4 collections (named as "other"). Family members of the home patients were examined for infection and seroconversion. Environmental sampling was performed twice with patients P2 and P3, and P2 was considered as an index due to the more recent start of the symptoms; however, some personal items from both were sampled. The sampling process is presented in a flow chart in Figure 1.
All research personnel conducting the sampling followed aerosol safety protocols and precautions and no infections were detected. All procedures that involved human participants, including environmental sampling, were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional or national research committee and the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The Ethics Committee of Helsinki University Hospital approved the study protocol (HUS/1701/2020). All respondents provided written informed consent prior to their participation.

2 | METHODS
2.1 | Index patients and safety measures
Patients were voluntary participants with a qRT-­PCR-­confirmed symptomatic COVID-­19 infection between 1.7.2020 and 16.3.2021. None of the participants had been vaccinated. As infectivity has

2.2 | Infection prevention protocols in the hospital
The infection prevention and control protocols on the COVID ward included hand hygiene, universal masking for staff (FFP2/3 for ICU and surgical masks for the COVID ward), guidance on social distancing (2 m), and personal protecting equipment (PPE) following droplet precautions. The patients did not use face masks. The ward and

ICU were cleaned twice a day between 9 to 10 am and 4 to 5 pm. The sample collections were done between cleaning around 11am to 9 pm and thus reflect quite reliably patients' infection status of the collection day. The specific cleaning protocol is presented in the supplement.
2.3 | Cell lines
Vero E6 cells (VE6) and their TMPRSS2-­expressing clone VE6-­ TMPRSS2-­10 (VE6T)43 were grown as previously described.44 To inhibit fungal growth, 0.205g/ml of amphotericin B (Fungizone, Thermo Scientific) was added to the medium of the cells that were taken to the hospital for aerosol collections. The used VE6 cell line is originally from ATCC (American type Culture Collection45), and the VE6T cell line has been modified from the original line according to the previous study.43
2.4 | Sampling protocols for air sampling
Seven different air collection methods were used. Details of the collections and samples are presented in Table S3. Sampling times and air volumes varied between different sampling methods depending on the expected optimal collection time for each device according to the manufacturer and previous studies, and

the knowledge gathered during the study. A Dekati PM10 cascade impactor (20L/min air flow, model PMS-­420) with three stages (>10.0 m, 2.5-­10 m, and 1.0-­2.5 m), including a backup filter for particles <1 m, was used in 11 collections. The three impaction stages were fitted with 25-­mm-­diameter cellulose acetate membrane filters (CA filter, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and the backup plate with a 40-­mm CA filter. Analyzing the three stages and backup filter, particle distribution according to aerodynamic size (PM10, PM2.5, and PM1) can be ascertained. The collector was placed within 1-­2 m from the patient, and particles were collected for 2-­4 h. After sampling, filters were immediately placed in 2 ml (25-­mm filter) or 3 ml (40-­mm filter) of minimal essential Eagle's medium (MEM, Sigma-­Aldrich).
The BioSpot 300p bioaerosol sampler prototype (Aerosol Devices Inc.) has a flow rate of 8 L/min and a mechanism that allows water to condense on aerosol particles from as small as 5-­10 nm to 20m in diameter and minimize the stress when the sample is impacted onto the surface with the collection medium. To increase the sample collection rate, the biosampler is equipped with eight wicking tubes fitted with three nozzle jets to secure gentle transfer of the sample. This sampler was used in 8 collections for 1.5-­4 h within a distance of 1-­2.5 m from the patient, and the sample was collected in 1-­2 ml of MEM.
As a more portable solution for personal area air sampling, a standard 25-­mm gelatin (Sartorius Stedim Biotech) or mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filter equipped in the Button sampler with a Gilian

5000 air sampling pump, 4 L/min air flow, and a porous curved surface inlet was used in 9 collections. The Button sampler collects particles smaller than 100m.46 The stability of SARS-­COV-­2 on two filter materials was compared under laboratory conditions to select the more optimal filter type and to optimize the collection time (details in Supplementary Material). Samples were collected for 10-­30min from patients' breathing area. Depending on the health status, a conversation was prompted to increase the output of aerosols. The collection filter was removed into 3 ml of MEM immediately after collection ended.
Three Andersen cascade impactors (400W pump and 28.3 L/min flow rate) were used simultaneously in six collections. The impactors consist of six stages with size cut points of (1) >7 m, (2) 4.7-­7.0 m, (3) 3.3-­4.7 m, (4) 2.1-­3.3 m, (5) 1.1-­2.1 m, and (6) 0.65-­1.1 m. An additional inlet was used during measurements limiting the upper limit of the particle size to 12m. To ensure the correct volume flow rate, each Andersen impactor was fitted with a TSI flow meter. Samples were collected using Petri dishes (94/16MM) with 15ml of cell medium for 10, 20, and 30min. The medium was transferred onto VE6T cells grown on 100/20MM cell culture dishes either immediately after collection in the hospital (collections 24, 25, 27, and 29) or later in the laboratory (collection 31).
To evaluate the real-­time particle number concentration during the hospital collections and to gather additional air samples, a Dekati eFilter was used in two collections. The eFilter monitors changes in real-­time particle concentration by utilizing a small diffusion charger powered by an inner chargeable battery. The charge changes were automatically translated into a signal, which was recorded on a data card. When postprocessing the data, the raw charge signal was further converted to represent particle number concentrations using a conversion factor (411cm-3 fA-1) provided by the manufacturer. A count median diameter (CMD) of 60nm and a geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 1.5 were assumed.47,48 In addition, the eFilter simultaneously collected samples on a 47-­mm gelatin filter using an external pump. After sample collection, the gelatin filter was transferred into 6 ml of MEM. The eFilter was fitted with the same EPA-­designed inlets as the Andersen cascade impactors. The particle size cut point of the inlets was approximately 12m, with an air volume flow rate of 28.3 L/min. The duration of sample collection was 30min at a similar distance from the patient as with Andersen's cascade impactors.
Passive air samples were collected either directly on VE6 cells (2 collections) or VE6T cells (9 collections) grown on 100/20MM (collection 22) or 35/10MM (other collections) cell culture dishes or on empty 35/10MM Petri dishes containing 1 ml of growth medium (10 collections). Open dishes were positioned at different proximities from the patient for 30-­60min, and the patient was encouraged to perform an aerosol-­producing activity such as talking. The ability of SARS-­CoV-­2 to infect cells at room temperature was confirmed, and major differences in the culture sensitivity of these two collection methods were excluded under laboratory conditions (see Supplementary Methods for details).

Living cells were transported to the laboratory in a warm environment with heat accumulators warmed to 37°C. One plate was used as a negative control to ensure that the cells survived the transport. Other samples were transported with cold accumulators and handled during the same or next day.
2.5 | Sampling protocols for surface sampling
Altogether, 252 surface samples in 26 collections for qRT-­PCR testing were taken from surfaces in possible direct or indirect contact with the patient (Table S3) with pre-­wetted Dacron swabs (Copan, 25 collections), a nitrile glove (1 collection), gauze (1 collection), or by pipetting the sampling liquid up and down on the surface a few times and transferring it into a sampling tube (3 collections). Swabs were placed into 1 ml of PBS. In 22 collections (212 samples), an additional sample was taken for virus culture, which was placed in 250l or 1 ml of MEM. Samples for qRT-­PCR and culturing were taken immediately next to each other. Surfaces were divided into four surface groups (high-­touch surfaces, low-­touch surfaces, toilet surfaces, and other surfaces) for statistical analyses.
2.6 | Other sampling protocols
Saliva samples were taken from 26 index patients either with a Dacron swab (collections 5-­9) or by spitting into a Falcon tube (from collection 10 onwards). Ten additional saliva samples were collected from other patients from the ward in four collections and from seven healthy family members of home-­treated patients. If possible, patients were asked to rinse their mouth before sampling. In collection 23, the index patient and a healthy family member also took follow­up saliva samples until 12days from the start of the patient's symptoms. In collection 26, follow-­up saliva samples were taken from patients until Days 14-­17 from the start of symptoms.
Nasopharyngeal samples from consenting patients were taken and sent to HUSLAB for a fresh diagnostic PCR.49,50 Serum samples from consenting patients were taken within a day from sampling and tested for SARS-­CoV-­2 IgG antibodies with two different tests.51 Serum samples (dilutions 1:10 to 1:640) were studied with the microneutralization assay.52 Blood lymphocyte and eosinophil counts, and plasma CRP from consenting patients were measured within a day of sampling, and plasma ferritin, ALP, ALT, D-­dimer, and fibrinogen levels within 3days. The respiration rate and SpO2 levels were measured during the same day (Table S1).
Since the first cases caused by variants of concern (VoC) were detected in Finland at the end of December 2020, they were determined from all patients as a part of routine diagnostics. This information was used to compare the results between VoC strains (mainly alpha in Finland) and non-­VoC strains. Virus strains of collections 1-­22 (P1-­P45) were considered as non-­VoC, as they were collected before the first cases were reported in Finland.

2.7 | RNA extraction and PCR protocols for air, saliva, and culture medium samples

2.8 | RNA extraction and PCR protocols for surface samples

Trizol (Invitrogen) was used to extract RNA from all saliva samples and from air and culture medium samples of collections 1-­23 according to the manufacturers' instructions. A 200-­l sample was added to 800l of Trizol reagent, and a resuspension volume of 50l was used. RNA was extracted from air and culture medium samples of collections 24 onwards with a QIAcube HT system and QIAamp 96 Virus QIAcube HT kit (QIAgen) using off-­ board lysis.
All samples were tested with two different qRT-­PCRs, N Charité,53 and N1 US CDC,54 using TaqMan Fast Virus 1-­Step Master Mix (ThermoFisher), a 20-­l reaction volume, 45cycles/ run, and fast cycling mode (annealing temperatures 55°C (N1 US CDC) and 58°C (N Charité)). The primer and probe concentrations of N Charité were according to the original publication,53 and those of N1 US CDC were 500nM of both primers and 125nM of probe (Table S7). qRT-­PCRs were performed using a Stratagene Mx3005P instrument (Agilent Technologies) with a Ct cutoff value of 0.04. The results were considered positive if both qRT-­PCRs were positive with a Ct value under 40 or if one qRT-­PCR was positive with a Ct value under 38. Comparable cutoff limits have been used in previous studies.18,55,56 Samples with Ct values over 38 in one qRT-­ PCR and no Ct with the other one were treated as negative, even though the possibility of them being very weak positives could not be excluded. RNA extracted from the Fin/20 strain52 culture was used as a positive control and nuclease-­free water as a negative control. Limit of detection in different laboratories has been around 5 copies/reaction for N1 US CDC and up to 50 copies/reaction for N Charité.57
The N gene transcript for qRT-­PCR was prepared as follows: The target region (352-­712, 360bp) was amplified from SARS-­ CoV-­2 RNA, Wuhan strain, and cloned into pGEM-­T cloning vector (Promega) under control of the SP6 promoter. The presence of the insert was verified by sequencing and restriction enzyme analysis. After linearization of the plasmid by digestion with AscI (Thermo Fisher Scientific), RNA was generated using the RiboMAXTM Large Scale RNA production system with SP6 polymerase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transcribed RNA was then treated with DNAse I and purified with the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Finally, RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry, and the RNA copy number was calculated based on its concentration, length, and molecular weight. qRT-­PCR was performed with N Charité PCR by including a transcript dilution series from 10 to 109 copies/reaction in triplicate and samples in duplicate. Copy numbers as copies/ml of saliva were calculated by tracing back from copies/ reaction reported by MxPro software (standard curve equation: Y = -3.570×LOG[X]+43.98, RSq = 0.984). Quantitating air samples in a similar way was unsuccessful due to weak positive samples and repeated freeze-­and-­thaw cycles and copy numbers for those were estimated based on the Ct values from initial qRT-­PCR and above equation from a different run but the same protocol.

RNA was extracted with the NucliSENS miniMAG kit (Biomerieux). Process control virus (mengovirus) was added to at least half of the samples. Tubes containing PBS and swabs were mixed by vortexing, and swabs were moved to 1 ml of high pH tris-­glycine-­beef extract buffer (TGBE, pH 9.5). The tubes were vortexed again and agitated at 250rpm for 5 min in an orbital shaker (IKAKS 2060 basic, Patterson Scientific), and the swabs were moved into a tube with 4 ml of lysis buffer, vortexed and agitated at 250rpm for 10 min. PBS, TGBE, and lysis buffer were then combined, vortexed, and incubated for 10 min. PBS without process control virus was included as a negative control and PBS with process control virus as a positive control. The rest of the extraction was carried out according to the NucliSENS miniMAG kit instructions. The samples were further treated with the OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Samples were tested for SARS-­CoV-­2 with modified versions of N Charité53 and N1 US CDC qRT-­PCRs54 and for process control virus.58 The RT-­qRT-­PCR was carried out using a QuantiTect Probe RT-­PCR kit (Qiagen). Reaction mixes included 10 l of 2X QuantiTect Probe RT-­PCR Master Mix, 0.2 l of QuantiTect RT mix, 0.6 M of forward and 0.8 M of reverse primer, 0.2 M of probe for N Charité qRT-­PCR primers, and 5 l of RNA template, and the volume was adjusted to 20l with water. For US CDC qRT-­PCR, final concentrations of 0.5 M for both primers and 0.2 M for the probe were used. For mengovirus qRT-­PCR, 1 M of both primers and 0.2 M of probe were used. N Charité and N1 US CDC runs included one 10-4 dilution of SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA extracted from cell-­grown virus as a standard positive control and one or two blanks as a standard negative control, and the reactions were performed in duplicate whenever the sample amount was sufficient. A Rotor Gene 3000 (Qiagen) real-­ time PCR cycler was used. The cycling conditions were reverse transcription for 30min at 53°C, a denaturation step at 95°C for 15min, followed by 45cycles of amplification/denaturation at 95°C for 15s, annealing at 58°C for 45s, and extension at 72°C for 45s. The results were analyzed with the thermocycler software Rotor-­Gene 6.0.31 (Qiagen) using similar criteria as with other samples described above.
2.9 | Culturing protocols
Samples were initially cultured in VE6 cells (collections 1-­18), which were changed to VE6T cells after reports of these being more sensitive (collections 19-­31).47 Air samples that were collected directly on cells were cultured as such, and the rest of the air and surface samples and 75l of saliva were used for culturing in 6-w­ ell plates. Medium was added to the final volume of 3 ml (saliva) or 2 ml (other samples). E-­ filter samples were cultured in two wells (3 ml/well). Samples were cultured at 37°C for 10-­14days and checked for cytopathic effect (CPE). A 200-­l sample of culture medium was taken from those samples that had unclear results based on microscopic observation or possible CPE

and tested with N Charité qRT-­PCR. Culturing was considered positive if CPE was detected and the Ct value of qRT-­PCR performed from the culture media was under 20. If Ct value was higher, it was judged to be caused by original (possibly noninfectious) virus in the sample instead of virus growth. All virus culturing was performed in a BSL3 laboratory. Optimization of the culturing protocols is described in more detail in the Supplementary Material.
2.10 | Statistical tests and design
Statistical tests were carried out with SPSS IBM Statistics version 27. When comparing means between two independent groups, data were first tested for normality with the Shapiro-­Wilk test before testing them either with the independent-­samples t-­test or a non-­parametric test (independent-­samples Mann-­Whitney U-­test for two groups and independent-­samples Kruskal-­Wallis test for more than two groups). For categorical data, the Fisher-F­ reeman-H­ alton exact test was used. Air and surface results of collections were compared with McNemar's test. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used for correlation testing. Mean values and standard deviations (normally distributed data), medians and interquartile ranges (non-­normally distributed data), or percentages (categorical data) of compared subgroups, test statistics, p-­values, and
 effect sizes (Cohen's d for the t-­test and z/ N for the Mann-W ­ hitney U-­test) are reported in Table S2. p-­values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Air or surface collections were considered positive if at least one of the samples from the collection was qRT-­PCR positive. Individual data points that were added to the boxplot figures were jittered in all dimensions using a uniform distribution. Figures were created either with Adobe Illustrator 2020 version 24.0.263 or SPSS IBM Statistics version 27.59 With labeling and design, Microsoft PowerPoint for Microsoft 365 MSO version 220160 and Microsoft Paint version 20H261 were used.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Patient characteristics and collection surroundings
We performed 23 sample collections in HUS and 7 collections in patients' homes in the Uusimaa region, Finland, between July 2020 and March 2021. During the collection period, the COVID-­19 incidence in the Uusimaa area was 1-­180 cases/100000 inhabitants/7days (average 61 cases/100000 inhabitants per week) and the test positivity rate varied between 0.1% -­ 4.5%.62 Collections included 56 patients of which 31 were index patients (1-2­ per collection, see Methods for details), 21 of whom were treated on a COVID-­19 cohort ward in a large patient hall, one in a single-­patient room, one in the intensive care unit (ICU), and eight patients treated in their homes (Figure 2).
The cohort ward had an air volume of 655.25m3 (height 4.5 m) and was provided with clean 100% outdoor supply air of 421L/s generating 1.67 air changes per hour (ACH) and 32.4-4­ 21L/s/patient depending on the number of patients. The mechanical ventilation type in the ward

was displacement ventilation. The amount of supply air was increased before 16.3.2021 to further prevent staff infections. This change generated a higher 2.99 ACH for the last measurement (patient 56, P56). The single room in the ward had displacement ventilation with 100% outdoor supply air generating 4.7 ACH. The ICU room had a laminar inlet area in the middle of the room generating 20.52 overall ACH, and an outlet on the side of the room. All the air was filtered with HEPA13 before entering the room. The measured patient located partly under the laminar area. All measured home environments had automated mechanical ventilation, which is normal in Finland. The measured rooms were circa 15-­30m2 in area with a normal room height of 2.5 m. We were not able to measure the exact ACH at homes, but it is expected that they followed building regulations which recommend 0.5 ACH for homes. Patient characteristics, including symptoms and laboratory results, are summarized in Table 1 (see Tables S1 and S2 for details of the patients and statistical tests used throughout the manuscript).
3.2 | SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA in air
Overall, 258 air samples were obtained from 29 air collections (Table S3). The samples were divided into actively and passively collected samples based on the collection method (see methods and the results below for details). In total, 33 (12.7%) air samples from 12 (41.4%) collections were qRT-­PCR positive. The rate of positive home collections was 57.1% and of hospital collections 36.3% (p = 0.403, Table S2). Estimated copy numbers varied between 1.04×103 copies/ml and 2.05×107 copies/ ml. All air samples were cultured, but no viable viruses were observed. The protocols and tests used to optimize the culturing protocol are described in the Supplementary Methods. Although five hospitalized patients (index patients P6, P7, P48, P56, and non-­index patient P5) used nasal canula oxygen or an oxygen mask during collection, which are considered aerosol-­generating procedures (AGPs), no positive samples were found during these collections. None of the patients used facemasks or respirators during their stay in the ward or in the ICU or during the measurements, which was according to the hospital policy as universal masking regarded only the staff and visitors.
3.2.1 | Active air sampling
Altogether, 154/258 (59.7%) air samples were collected with five different active air samplers, comprising (1) three simultaneous Andersen six-­stage cascade impactors (Andersen) with different sampling times, (2) a BioSpot 300p bioaerosol sampler (BioSpot), (3) a Button sampler (Button), (4) a Dekati PM10 cascade impactor (Dekati), or (5) a Dekati eFilter (eFilter). The time from the start of symptoms to air collection varied from 3 to 12days. Positive samples were observed in 3/44 (6.8%) samples with the Dekati, 0/9 (0.0%) with the Biospot, 2/9 (22.2%) with the Button, 15/90 (16.7%) with the Andersen, and 0/2 (0.0%) with the eFilter (Table S4, results from home and hospital collections have been combined, as there was no statistically significant difference between the positivity rates for the collections).

RNA was found in particles in the size ranges 0.65-­4.7 m and >7 m in Andersen collectors, >10 m and <2.5 m in Dekati samplers, and <100m in Button samplers (Table 2; Table S3). On-­line particle concentrations measured with the eFilter on the COVID-­19 ward were in the range of 534-­6608cm-3 (3380±2320cm-3), and no clear particle emission events were observed.
3.2.2 | Passive air sampling
A total of 91 passive air samples (14 collections) were collected by deposition on open-­cell culture plates. The mean collection time was 0.69h (range 0.3-3­ .0 h, SD 0.51), and the mean distance from the patient was 0.94m (range 0.2-­5.0 m, SD 0.84). Sampling points differed between home and hospital collections (p = 0.001, Table S2), but distances from the patient were similar (p = 0.398, Table S2). In total,

12 deposition sample (11.5%) in 8 (57.1%) collections were positive for SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA (Table 3). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportions of qRT-­PCR-­positive samples (p = 0.333) or collections (p = 1.000) between home and hospital (Table S2).
Thirteen experimental respiratory samples (coughing, breathing, talking for 2 min in front of an open-­cell culture plate, or spitting once onto an open-­cell culture plate) were collected from seven patients with a mean symptom day of 7.8 (range 5-­8, SD 2.17). Out of all the respiratory samples, only one of the spit samples was qRT-­ PCR positive (Table S3).
3.3 | SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA on surfaces
We collected 252 surface samples, 182 (72.2%) of which were from the hospital and 70 (27.8%) from patients' homes. In total, 25/252

samples (9.9%) from 15/27 collections (57.7%) were qRT-­PCR positive (Table 4; Table S5). Viable virus was not detected in any of the 212 cultured surface samples. There was no difference in the proportion of positive samples between the four surface groups (p = 0.646, Table S2) or between home and hospital collections (p = 0.351, Table S2). For a given positive collection, there was no significant difference between finding the virus from the air or on surfaces (p = 0.344, Table S2).
3.4 | Effects of patient factors on environmental contamination
Positive air samples were found even when the index patient did not report any respiratory symptoms (2/3, 66.6%). However, there was a statistically significant connection between low oxygen

saturation (SpO2) levels and SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA findings from surfaces, and a possible but nonsignificant connection between low SpO2 levels and RNA findings from the air (surface: p = 0.026, air: p = 0.098, Table S2). Toilet surfaces were qRT-­PCR positive in 33.3% (3/9) of cases when the index patient had GI symptoms and 0% of cases (0/9) when the index patient did not report any GI symptoms (p = 0.229, Table S2). No positive environmental samples were obtained if the saliva sample from the index patient was negative with both qRT-­PCRs. Positive surface samples were detected more often when there were multiple COVID-­19 patients in the ward/house during the sampling (p = 0.018, Figure S1). However, no statistically significant difference was detected for air collections (p = 0.845) (Figure S1). Possible but statistically nonsignificant associations were observed between positive environmental samples and an earlier symptom day, as well as an older age (Figure S1 and S1c). No statistically significant connections were found between air and

samples and 8/10 of the samples from other patients were qRT-­ PCR positive. RNA copy numbers varied between 1.65×103 and 5.13×107 copies/ml (mean 3.55×106 copies/ml [SD 1.10×107]). Six of the qRT-­PCR-­positive samples taken between symptom days
2 and 11 were also positive in virus culture (five of which were
index patients). Culture-­positive samples had lower Ct values than
culture-­negative samples (p<0.001 (N1 US CDC), p = 0.019 (N Charité), Figure S3). Age showed a trend of positive correlation with
copy number, but it was not statistically significant (Spearman's
rho = 0.339, p = 0.106, Figure S5a). The mean copy number in the saliva of the index patients was 9.37×105 copies/ml (SD 7.57×105) in collections that had qRT-­PCR-­positive air samples and 7.74×106 copies/ml (SD 7.26×106) in collections where all air samples were qRT-­PCR negative (p = 0.536) (Figure S5e). The respective figures for surface collections were 5.61×106 copies/ml (SD 1.52×107) in positive and 1.54×105 copies/ml (SD 1.85×105) in negative collections (p = 0.291) (Figure S5e). No connections were observed between saliva culturing results and PCR from the environment:
PCR-­positive air samples were detected in 40% (2/5) of the collec-
tions when the saliva of the index patient was culture positive on a

collection day and in 44% (8/18) of the collections when saliva was culture negative. In surface collections, the same numbers were 60% (3/5) and 65% (11/17).
3.6 | SARS-­CoV-­2 antibodies in serum samples
Serum samples were obtained from 21 hospital-­treated patients (13 index patients and six other patients on the ward) and four home-­ treated patients (two index patients and two other patients). In total, 10 serum samples were positive for IgG or Nabs. Antibodies were detected at the earliest on symptom Day 3 (P13, positive with two IgG tests, Nab titer 80). Of the antibody-­positive patients, 9/10 were qRT-­PCR positive from saliva and one (P16, symptom Day 11, Nab titer 80) was also positive in viral culture. The index patients had Nabs against SARS-­CoV-­2 in five of the collections, and in four of these, PCR-­positive environmental samples were detected (active air samples in one (P49, Nab titer >640), deposition air samples in two (P41 and P43, Nab titers 40 and 10), and surface samples in two (P13 and P43, Nab titers 80 and 10)).

OKSANEN et al.
3.7 | Transmission of COVID-­19 to family members
The spread of COVID-­19 within the family was examined by collecting saliva samples from family members of the five home-­treated patients and analyzing qRT-­PCR results and SARS-­CoV-­2 antibody levels. In two families that used protective measures, including respiratory protection (surgical mask or respirator) and intensified cleaning, no further infections were detected. One of these families used masks in common areas, but not in their own rooms behind closed doors. In another family, the bedroom was shared, and masks were used all the time. However, in three families that did not apply any protective measures or used only intensified cleaning, secondary infections were observed. In two families, all other family members were infected, and in one family, one out of three other family members was infected. (See Supplementary Material for details regarding measures used to prevent further infections).
4 | DISCUSSION
This study detected considerable SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA contamination from both home and hospital environments. The virus was found in the air in particle size ranges of 0.65-­4.7 m, 7.0-­12.0 m, >10 m, and<100m in diameter (Table 2), supporting existing literature.17,19,20,22 Our findings also support discoveries that normal respiratory activities generate infective particles even in the absence of AGPs,2,6,64,65 and respiratory symptoms. Additionally, low oxygen saturation showed a connection with a higher possibility of SARS-­CoV-­2 surface findings and a potential connection with air findings, which could follow from increased particle generation due to respiratory stress. Most (83%, 15/18) of our positive air samples with known particle size were in particles smaller than 4.7 m, which supports the findings that at least 85% of the viral load is emitted in aerosols smaller than 5 m.6,20,66 This is in line with the fact that particle generation produces a distribution which form depends on the activity that is causing the particles. In human respiratory activities, generated particles are mainly small, under 5 m in dry size distribution.67,68
A previous study showed that a high sampling flow rate increases the success rate in detecting SARS-­CoV-­2 from air samples.21 When 50L/min air samplers were used, no positive samples were detected, but when sampling flowrate was raised to 150L/min 72% of samples were positive.21 In our study, SARS-­CoV-­2 was detected from the air with a minimum collection period of 10 min (Andersen's impactor) and a minimum air volume of 72L (Button sampler). With an average respiratory rate of 14/min and volume of 0.5 L/breath, this would mean exposure times of 40min (Andersen) and 10 min (Button) for the examined virus variants (alpha and undetermined VoC (Andersen), as well as non-­VoC (Button)). Current safety guidelines use 15min exposure time regarding contact tracing.69 Our results, although limited due to the low number of collections and only qRT-­PCR findings, support concerns that a shorter exposure time should be considered, at least for close contacts.70 Overall,

 | 11 of 17
the exposure risk is cumulating with time and no limit to zero risk can be determined. The risk for infection depends on the concentration exposed to (depending on ventilation and produced quanta) as well as persons immunity.27,71-­73 Virus variants such as the delta and omicron variants seem to lower the exposure time needed for infection, following estimated higher viral load in the presence of the delta variant74 and increased transmissibility of omicron variants possibly due immune evasion.75,76 Also, already low infectious doses have been shown to cause infection in an animal model.38,77 A previous study did not observe significant differences in environmental contamination prevalence or Ct values between alpha and omicron B.1.1.529, which could further point toward a higher receptor binding affinity and immune escape properties of omicron variant78 and enable the use of studies carried out with previous variants also when evaluating the environmental burden of newer variants.
Our results from respiratory activities demonstrated that 0.5-­2 min of activity did not produce enough virus to be detected with qRT-­PCR with this methodology, even from a close distance of 10 cm. However, it should be noted that the open deposition collection method for both respiratory activities and passive air (deposition) samples is highly dependent on the success of the impactation and the flow field near the collection surface,79 being susceptible for example to head movements and indoor air flows. Still, a quite high proportion (11.5%) of passive air samples was positive for SARS-­ CoV-­2 RNA. This supports the role of aerosol particle deposition as a source to surface contamination as previous studies have suggested.17,80 The deposition offers more gentle collection method and possibility to collect directly to the cells or cell media possibly allowing more viral preservation compared to active sampling. This could at least partly explain why viral findings were seen in our work and in previous work17 when active aerosol samples remained negative.
Multiple positive air samples were collected from a large (655.25m3) mechanically ventilated hospital hall (Figure 1), even when there were only two patients. Overall, larger spaces are considered safer than small ones due to the larger air volume per person.81 However, it seems that also larger indoor spaces may form a risk environment if occupied by an infected person for a prolonged time period.82-­84 In our study, all patients in the ward were COVID patients. However, in many countries, COVID-­positive patients have been separated from COVID-­negative ones with just curtains and distance. As hospital-­acquired infections have been a significant part of overall infections and deaths,85-8­ 7 it is important to reduce the risk of infections in hospital wards. It should be noted that the infective aerosol particles may still generate an infection risk even when larger space allows more dilution with increasing distance, as shown by Karan et al.88 Our findings were mainly from a close distance similar to a previous study that saw higher probability to environmental findings inside 2-­meter range,24 even though the risk for infection especially in prolonged exposure remains also further away.27,28
It is interesting that the proportion of the positive samples was similar in hospital and home even when the ventilation was more efficient in the hospital and patients have later symptom day. This may be due to more patients in the same room or higher overall viral load

which has been associated with more severe disease and higher age in previous studies.89,90 We observed a trend for an older age being associated with a higher viral load (Figure S5a) and a larger number of positive surface samples but confirming this would require further studies with a larger sample sizes. In earlier studies, higher viral loads have been associated with an increased probability of viral transmission.91,92 Possible reasons for the relationship between age and infectivity include reduced saliva production, differences in mucus viscosity and salivary immunoglobulins,93 increased expression of the ACE2 receptors needed for cell entry of SARS-­CoV-­2,94 thinning of the epithelium,95 and impairment of the immune response with age.96
Toilet surface samples were positive only when the index patient-­reported GI symptoms. Infectious SARS-­CoV-­2 has been recovered from urine and stool samples,97 and flushing of the toilet and vomiting can generate aerosols, which will later deposit on the surfaces.98,99 This risk should be noted in both environments and toilets should not be shared with non-­COVID patients, if possible. Other more frequently qRT-­PCR-­positive surfaces included highly touched personal items, hospital equipment, and the floor, which is in line with the previous findings.18,19,34 Even though RNA may persist on surfaces for some time, RNA findings most likely result from contamination on the same day due to daily cleaning.
The building body of evidence supports airborne route predominance for SARS-­CoV-­2 transmission,1-­4,14 and an animal study indicates that aerosol inoculation is a more efficient route and causes more severe pathology and higher viral loads.100 Fomites have not been proven to serve as the sole or primary vehicle of transmission.101 The probability for surface transmission is estimated to be likely rare, generally less than 1 in 10 000, and the disease manifestation milder.102 The environmental samples that commonly presented infectious virus in previous studies were mainly in direct contact with infected patients' mucus membranes, or saliva or sputum secretions (e.g., nasal prongs, nasal canula, used tissue, patients mask, and endotracheal tube).25,38 In this study, families that took protective measures (including isolation of the infected family member) and respiratory protection (surgical masks or FFP2 respirators) were able to prevent further infections even when qRT-­PCR-­positive samples were collected from both surfaces and air. However, in a household where all surfaces were cleaned many times a day but no respiratory protection was used, all family members became infected. This supports the importance of air hygiene, including also portable air cleaners as a supportive method as shown in previous studies,15,28 and also encourages control of infection spread in homes. Similar findings supporting the use of masks, isolation with closed door, and opening windows in home environment were found to lower the risk of contamination in the work of Picard et al.103 Overall our results indicate that transmission may happen through several transmission routes as supported also in previous systematic review.20 Infection control is even more important with VoC strains that feature a higher rate of household transmission.104
To better understand the infectivity and state of the infection compared to the environmental findings, we collected saliva and

serum samples. SARS-­CoV-­2 was cultured from saliva during symptom Days 2-­11.42 SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA was detected in the saliva of patients who had already formed IgG and NAbs, which align with previous findings of prolonged RT-­PCR-­positivity.105-­107 In addition, the saliva of P16 on symptom Day 11 was still positive in virus culture, even though the patient had NAbs. Moreover, we obtained positive air and surface samples when the index patient had a positive IgG result and NAbs, which agrees with the findings of Lei et al.108 This contradicts the suggestion that NAbs solely could be a reliable marker for non-­infectivity78. In the view of infection control, we agree with Lei et al.,108 Tan et al.109 and Wölfel et al.110 that the risk for exposure can remain after the patient starts to seroconvert and possibly improve clinically. As seroconversion seems an unreliable marker for viral clearance, other means, such as an antigen test, should be used to assess the infection risk before ending precaution protocols.111,112
Showing viable virus from environmental is highly demanding. Previous studies have presented a few possibly positive findings.10-­13,36-­38,66 However, the findings of those studies have been under criticism as none of them has been able to show clear CPE with significant decrease in Ct values leaving questions if the CPE was truly induced by SARS-­CoV-­2. Despite the culturing attempts of all 258 air samples and 212 surface samples, we were unable to detect viable virus from the environment. Also, only 20% of qRT-­PCR-­positive saliva samples of symptomatic patients were positive in cell culture. We did several attempts to optimize the culture protocol (Supplementary Methods) and performed qRT-­PCR on culture media whenever the slightest sign of CPE was detected. Explanations for our negative results are that there was no infectious virus in the environment at the time of the samplings or that current methods were not sensitive enough to detect it. As SARS-­CoV-­2 is efficiently transmitted in hospital wards and between family members,113,114 even from quarantine room to another via corridor and similarly timed door opening,115 we conclude that the methodology is likely too unsensitive.116 A significant loss of infective viruses in air sampling has also been demonstrated,117-­123 and current impaction and impingement sampling methods have low collection efficiency for small, nanometer-­sized particles.121,122 Sousa et al. managed to show SARS-­CoV-­2 related PFU findings with electrostatic air sampler, which may provide a more gentle collection method, however, even they observed rapid and significant inactivation of the virus during collection.12 The absolute collection efficiencies of the samplers are unknown and should be addressed in future research.123 Even though detection of viral RNA in the air and on the surface does not necessarily mean an infectious virus, negative culturing results do not rule out the infection risk either. Due to these difficulties and the high transmission rates, we consider already RNA findings to be interpreted as a possible infection risk. In the future, sampling methods and devices should be developed to better preserve the viability and infectivity, for example mimicking the humidity and airflow of the airways to avoid mechanical stress and utilizing direct collection onto the cells or culture medium to avoid losses during transport. In an ideal situation, the future sampling methods would

also allow on-­site recognition of the viruses from air as well as from surfaces.124 Also, additional methods (e.g., virus sequencing) that can be applied to a large number of samples should be utilized and further developed in future studies on environmental transmission.
Overall, this study combined a large number of environmental samples and detailed patient data to more comprehensively understand environmental contamination and the effect of patient-­ dependent factors. The patient material was representative regarding symptoms and laboratory results for COVID-­19.125 In addition to the hospital environment, we collected samples from homes where symptoms are generally less severe, the time from the onset of symptoms is shorter, and air conditioning is different from that of a hospital. Recent findings suggest that the environmental contamination is rather similar between the first variants and omicron,78 suggesting that the results from the earlier variants can still be considered to provide valid information for the current situation.
Our study also has some limitations. Even though the overall number of our samples is quite high compared to previous studies, it is still limited in the statistical aspect and only able to detect major differences and associations. As environmental sampling is time consuming and resource intensive, making it challenging to achieve a statistically large enough sample size, it is important to combine findings from several different studies for more detailed analysis. We only conducted environmental sampling at a single time point. In the future, a longitudinal examination could enable a more accurate examination of the effects of the course of disease for environmental contamination. The mean time from the onset of symptoms until sampling varied between homes and hospital and may affect the results. However, as the infection requiring hospital treatment is more severe, the viral loads may stay high longer,112,126 and accordingly, no major differences were detected in viral load in saliva in our study between homes and hospital patients. This would provide rather similar expectation for environmental contamination as Buonanno et al examined.14 Also, patients generally arrive to the hospital at the later stage of the disease (excluding hospital-­acquired infections that were not detected in this dataset) which makes our dataset suitable to represent the real situation between homes and hospitals. In addition, we only measured the IgG and NAb response, but viral secretion from mucus membranes can continue if the IgA response is weak.127 The IgA immune response should thus be examined further in upcoming studies. The qRT-­PCR results might include some uncertainty due to the differences in the texture and fluidity of saliva and should be considered as estimates. As many samples were collected from a large patient hall, it is possible that some observed viruses might have originated from other than the index patient. However, most of the surface samples were from patient-­specific surfaces, and aerosols are known to concentrate near the source,71 indicating that most of the positive samples are expected to be produced by the index patient. Particle size cutoffs in Andersen samplers might be slightly higher than estimated, as the amount of liquid used in the sampling was slightly smaller than recommended due to practical reasons. Finally, we strongly suggest developing a new,

more sensitive methodology for assessing the virus viability to better assess transmission mechanisms.
5 | CONCLUSIONS
This study found SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA from air samples in wide range of different-­sized particles during normal respiratory activity from both home and hospital environment. We observed positive air samples from a large ventilated patient hall in collections corresponding to 10 min of normal respiration, although current restricted air sampling techniques may have caused some virus loss. We also detected SARS-­CoV-­2 RNA-­positive air and surface samples after patients had developed antibodies. These results highlight the need for appropriate infection control against airborne and surface transmission routes in both environments, even after antibody production has begun.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE
Aerosol generation during paediatric procedural sedation with continuous-flow nitrous oxide suggests a low risk of airborne viral transmission to health-care workers
Robert Millar 1,2 and Andrew Moorhouse2
1Department of Critical Care, University of Melbourne and 2Austin Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia

Aim: Inhaled nitrous oxide is a common form of procedural sedation in paediatric care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about potential aerosol generation and associated viral transmission to health-care workers have led to controversy regarding its use. We aimed to measure the degree of aerosol generation during continuous flow nitrous oxide sedation to inform future guidelines. Methods: Aerosol numbers in the respirable range were measured using a particle counter during 30 procedures undertaken in children under nitrous oxide sedation in the Emergency Department. Results: Changes from baseline measurements were greatest in particles in the 0.3 m range. The mean increase from baseline in 0.3 m particles per cubic metre was 18 022 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5949-30 096) after the child entered the room, and 2931 (95% CI À4407 to 10 269) during nitrous oxide administration. Conclusion: Variation of respirable particle numbers from baseline levels was no greater during nitrous oxide administration than for breathing and talking asymptomatic children. These results suggest the additional risk of airborne viral transmission to staff during inhaled nitrous oxide sedation is low.
Key words: aerosols; child; COVID-19; hypnotics and sedatives; viruses.

What is already known on this topic
1 Viruses may be transmitted by aerosols from patient to healthcare worker.
2 Recommendations have been made during the COVID-19 pandemic for clinicians to avoid procedures which may generate aerosols.
3 The actual risk of aerosol generation by inhaled nitrous oxide has not previously been documented.

What this paper adds
1 The additional aerosols above baseline generated by a child are mostly below 5 m in diameter, primarily at the 0.3 m range.
2 Using continuous flow nitrous oxide delivery with gas scavenging and a cushion mask the aerosol numbers were no greater than for an unmasked asymptomatic child.
3 Recommendations regarding inhaled nitrous oxide need not be restrictive due to concerns about aerosol generation.

Inhaled nitrous oxide (N2O) is a common agent used for procedural sedation in paediatric practice across a range of subspecialties including Emergency Medicine, Oncology and Radiology.1 Concerns about aerosol transmission of viral particles to health-care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the use of N2O being curtailed by a number of professional bodies and institutions. In the absence of specific evidence, this recommendation was based on concurrent guidelines for high-flow oxygen therapies, in addition to evidence that infected

children may be asymptomatic.2 The guideline from the Austral-
asian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) states that there is `insufficient and conflicting information' about the aerosolgenerating potential of inhaled N2O.3 The New South Wales Health guideline states that `Nitrous oxide sedation should be avoided because of high rates of aerosolisation'.4 No studies published to date have quantified the risk of aerosol generation from the use of N2O in clinical practice, and this uncertainty has led to conservative decisions designed to protect HCW.
The inclusion of inhaled N2O as a potentially aerosolgenerating procedure (AGP) mostly likely stems from the theoretical risk from a relatively high gas flow over a moist mucosal surface. However, aerosol generation using Hudson facemask oxygen (at 15 L/min) and high flow nasal oxygen (at both 30 and 60 L/min) has now been demonstrated to be low in a laboratory clean room.5 Continuous flow N2O might be expected to

have similarly low levels of aerosol generation and may be even lower due to a more closely fitting mask, the use of a viral filter in the circuit, and scavenging of expired gas into the circuit. Some continuous flow systems have been described as having a very low risk for developing positive pressure in normal spontaneous (non-forced) ventilation, and therefore at low risk for creating aerosols,1 although aerosol counts from these systems have not been confirmed experimentally.
HCW infection by aerosols depends on the carriage of an adequate number of viable microbial particles before penetration of host tissues.6 Sampling of aerosols for viral particles is technically very challenging,7 but measurement of aerosol particle numbers is a reasonable proxy as without aerosol generation airborne transmission is not possible. The aim of this study was to quantify the level of aerosol generation during clinical practice while delivering N2O by continuous flow for procedural sedation in children, and therefore determine the likely hazard due to aerosol-based viral transmission that this may represent for HCW.
Methods
Setting
The study was conducted from October 2020 to May 2021 in the mixed Emergency Department (ED) of a metropolitan tertiary hospital with 18 000 paediatric presentations annually, situated in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. All procedures were performed in the same normally pressured procedure room measuring 3.7 Â 2.7 Â 4.6 m3 (46 cubic meters) with 6 air exchanges per hour.
Subjects
The study was conducted during medically indicated procedural sedation with N2O in a convenience sample of 30 patients aged 2-14 years without respiratory symptoms. Procedures performed included fracture reduction and casting, wound suturing, removal of subcutaneous foreign bodies, and eye irrigation.
Equipment and procedures
N2O and oxygen were delivered with a continuous flow device (Quantiflex MDM, Matrix Medical Inc., Orchard Park, NY, USA) at 6-20 L/min via a disposable circuit with a viral filter attached to a cushion mask. Staff in the procedure room wore personal protective equipment (PPE) as recommended by the state health department at the time. Otherwise, there was no change to the usual process of patient care. Parents and carers present wore surgical masks at all times. The child was the only person in the room not wearing a respiratory mask.
Airborne particle numbers were measured with a particle counter (3016-IAQ; Lighthouse, Freemont, CA, USA) mounted on a stand with the air intake port at a height of 1.45 m to simulate the facial level of standing staff members, and placed against the head of the patient trolley (Fig. 1). Particle numbers were recorded in six particle sizes (0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 m) obtained in 60 s intervals at seven standardised time points during the procedural process:

Fig. 1 Particle counter (circled in red) positioned at the head of the bed to simulate staff member face level.
· empty room prior to patient entry (baseline) · after patient entry to the procedure room (unmasked patient
talking) · during initial N2O administration · during the procedure · during N2O washout with oxygen · after mask removal · after staff and patient had left the room
Positive controls were also obtained after each procedure using a single puff from a salbutamol metered-dose inhaler (MDI), and with 4 mL saline nebulised in a standard Hudson nebuliser with a gas flow of 6 L/min.
On a technical note, devices used for environmental monitoring often report aerosols primarily by particle mass (e.g. PM5 refers to the mass of all particles below 5 m in size). However, this is problematic where there is a mixture of particle densities present. Respiratory water-based particles will have a density of close to 1.0 g/cm3 whereas respirable dust particles have been found to be 4% water and 69% carbonbased organic matter which will have a much greater density.8 As the Lighthouse particle counter used in this study reports both the number and mass of particles, numerical reporting of particles was selected as the appropriate choice for this study where the measured particles were likely to be a mixture of dust and water.
Particle numbers were downloaded from the counter and analysed in an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). As baseline particle numbers in the room were slightly different on each occasion, the variance from the initial measurement on each occasion was calculated. Results are reported as mean particles per cubic metre as measured over a 60 second interval in the 30 cases. The study was approved as a quality improvement activity by the Austin Health Office for Research and was determined not to require submission to the Human Research Ethics Committee, nor require patient or carer consent.

Results
Baseline (pre-entry) particle counts demonstrated that the smallest particles (0.3 m) predominated. The number of particles decreased as particle size increased (Table 1, Fig. 2). When an unmasked patient (with masked staff and parent) entered the room, the change in particle counts was primarily in particles below 5 m in diameter, and most prominently in particles of 0.3 m (Fig. 3).
The mean differences from pre-entry baseline levels (with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for 0.3 m particle counts are demonstrated in Figure 4.
The mean difference in particle count during post-entry (talking unmasked patient: 18 022; 95% CI 5949-30 096) and N2O administration phases (2931; 95% CI À4407 to 10 269) were also compared to positive controls of an MDI puff (709 954,

95% CI 568 379-851 529) and saline nebulisation (249 203 945, 95% CI 194 685 598-305 150 231) (Fig. 5).
Discussion
Respiratory particles range from 0.5 to 20 m in diameter, with the larger droplets (>20 m) likely to fall directly to the ground, smaller droplets (5-20 m) falling more slowly, and the smallest particles (<5 m) more likely to be suspended in the air for a longer period.7 These droplet nuclei (or aerosols) are more likely to be inhaled and reach the lower respiratory tract.7 The risk of transmission of viruses from larger particles is likely to much greater due to their greater volume and therefore higher viral load, but are relatively more avoidable in medical settings by use of contact and droplet precautions.

However, precautions against viruses aerosolised in small particles are more difficult and expensive, requiring filtered masks and face barriers.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, much debate in the clinical sphere has been concerned with defining AGPs which require these greater precautions. AGPs have been defined

as any procedure that `results in an infectious aerosol beyond that which would normally be released by a patient coughing, breathing, or talking, presenting an increased risk to any HCW in proximity to the patient'.7 There is little doubt that symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection can create aerosols with viable virus,9 and that AGPs should be avoided in these patients. However, despite routine symptom screening of patients, there are concerns of potential risk from performing AGPs in asymptomatic but nonetheless infectious patients.
Following the previous SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, a systematic review of transmission events to HCW who were most likely protected only by contact and droplet precautions demonstrated a statistically significant association with tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheotomy and manual ventilation before intubation.6 A statistically significant transmission risk was not found for other procedures such as manual ventilation, endotracheal aspiration, suction of body fluids, bronchoscopy, nebuliser treatment, administration of oxygen, high flow oxygen, manipulation of oxygen or BiPAP masks, defibrillation, chest compressions, insertion of nasogastric tube, chest physiotherapy and collection of sputum.6 However, since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, almost all of those procedures have been included in lists of AGPs, including procedures appearing similar to high-flow oxygen such as N2O sedation. This has an impact not only on the usage of precious high-grade PPE, but also on patients whose care is altered by the consequent changes in practice.
Other medical craft groups have sought to determine the aerosol risk of their normal practice more accurately, as the exclusion of aerosol generation by specific procedures should allow them to be safely continued with contact and droplet precautions during respiratory pandemics. Investigations by groups working in ophthalmology,10 otorhinolaryngology,11 and dentistry12 have sought to determine the aerosol risk of their normal practice. While some devices and procedures

designed to reduce aerosol exposure have shown greater risk on empiric testing,13 some procedures that were initially avoided due to theoretical risks have been demonstrated to be low risk.10 Fortunately for paediatric practice, children appear to have a lower risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and when infected seem to be less infectious to others than they are with other viruses,14 possibly due to differences in tissue expression of receptors.15 However, theoretical risks in paediatric practice have still been stated in relation to nebulised medication, high-flow oxygen therapies, intubation, and inhaled N2O administration. The often unpredictable behaviours of children, including crying or shouting, are also considered a factor that might increase the risk of aerosol generation.
In our study, the particle counts that HCW were exposed to during N2O administration were no greater than, and possibly lower than, an unmasked talking child. Higher particle levels during the procedure phase most likely represent movement of staff, and plaster dust in some cases, as particle levels fell again during the washout phase. These results appear to confirm that our longstanding practice of using a close-fitting facemask and gas scavenging during the use of continuous flow N2O act to prevent an increase in aerosol levels. HCW should therefore be safe in administering inhaled sedation in asymptomatic patients by this method without the need for aerosol precautions.
Limitations
This study is limited by being conducted at a single site and with one type of continuous-flow N2O system (although common in many Australian EDs), which may limit generalisability. The ideal experimental conditions of near-zero baseline particle levels in a clean room were not possible in this clinical environment, and so a small portable particle counter was required and variance from

the baseline levels was calculated. This study also measured aerosol generation alone and cannot make any conclusions on the viral load within those aerosols.
Conclusions
Use of continuous-flow nitrous oxide for paediatric procedural sedation in our cohort generated no more aerosol particles than a child who was breathing and talking. It also produced aerosols at least 4 orders of magnitude less than nebulisation therapy. This suggests that nitrous oxide sedation delivered by continuous flow with a close-fitting cushion facemask and gas-scavenging has a low risk of aerosol viral transmission to health-care workers in the event that the child has a subclinical viral infection. Similar techniques could be employed in future to determine the aerosol-generating potential of other clinical procedures.

INTRODUCTION

CASE REPORT

Since December 2019, cases of pneumonia with unknown causes have emerged in succession in Wuhan, China (1, 2). On January 7, 2020, it was identified as a type of novel coronavirus (Coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) by virus typing. By January 30, 2020, a total of 7700 cases were confirmed and 170 cases died (3). To date, there have been few reports of chest computed tomography (CT) findings of COVID-19 pneumonia patients (4). We report a confirmed case of COVID-19 pneumonia in a 40-year-old female. Written informed consent was waived by the Jiangxi Provincial People's Hospital Institutional Review Board.

A 40-year-old female presented with a fever for 3-days, as well as chest tightness, and fatigue for 2-days was admitted to our emergency department. The patient was physically healthy before and had no underlying diseases. She did not travel to Wuhan city and denied any contact with patients with COVID-19 infection.
At admission, her body temperature was elevated to 38.9°C. Laboratory examinations showed normal leukocyte (4170/L), neutrophils (59.6%), and lymphocytes (30.9%). There was an increase in hematocrit (0.456) and glucose (7.3 mmol/L) levels. The initial chest radiograph, taken 3-days after fever onset, was normal in both lungs (Fig. 1A). On the same day, unenhanced chest CT showed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the subpleural area of the right lower lobe (Fig. 1B), and the left lung was normal. She was given antibiotics for symptomatic treatment.
At first, the patient did not show any respiratory symptoms, however, on day 6 after fever onset, she began coughing. A follow-up chest CT revealed an increased density of GGOs in the right lower lobe, which then progressed into consolidations with perilobular thickening. Moreover, multifocal peripheral patchy areas of nodular consolidations and GGO lesions were newly developed in the subpleural areas of the both lower lobes (Fig. 1C-E). Laboratory

examination showed decreased leukocyte (3390/L) and eosinophils (0.0%); normal neutrophils (67.4%) and lymphocytes (23.7%); and increased C-reactive protein (8.00 mg/L). The influenza A antigen screening was negative. Finally, she was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by realtime reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRTPCR) amplification of the viral DNA from a sputum sample.
The patient was isolated and treated with antiviral drug (lopinavir: 200 mg/capsule, 2 capsules each time, twice a day) and antibiotics (tabaxin [piperacillin + tazobactam]). After 6 days of treatment, the temperature of the patient dropped to normal and the symptoms disappeared. On day 12, a repeat rRT-PCR was negative and the patient was discharged. At the time of discharge, a repeat CT showed that the previous consolidations and GGOs in both lungs were almost absorbed leaving a few fibrous lesions that may represent residual organizing pneumonia (Fig. 1F).
DISCUSSION
Since December 2019, some hospitals in Wuhan have been suffering from pneumonia of unknown causes, later identified as a COVID-19 by the whole genome sequence analysis of the viruses in the respiratory samples from the patients (5). This coronavirus belongs to the  genus, which was named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (6, 7). Most of the initial cases had a history of exposure to the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan city, and some cases rendered a family clustering feature. The source of infection is still unknown, however it is speculated that the infection may have been caused by bats or vipers (8). The infection is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets. The median time from onset to admission to the hospital was 9 days, and most patients were between 40 and 60 years-old. The clinical manifestations are mainly fever, fatigue, and dry cough, with gradual dyspnea in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe cases (2, 3, 9). In this case, the patient had no clear history of contact with the epidemic area, and both the leukocytes and lymphocytes were normal, thus it was misdiagnosed as common pneumonia at first.
In this case, the initial CT showed GGOs in the right lower lobe, the pathology of which may represent pulmonary edema or hyaline membrane formation (4). The density of the lesions is so subtle that it can hardly be depicted by conventional radiographs. Therefore, routine CT examination is recommended for the patients suspected of COVID-19

to reduce missed diagnosis (1). CT findings of this patient include the short-term progression of lesions, multiple patchy consolidations and GGOs in both lungs, especially in the peripheral lung zones of the lower lobes, which may represent alveolar injury, cellular and fibrous exudation. After treatment, the consolidations and GGOs were almost absorbed, leaving fibrous cord-like shadows that represent fibrosis.
In conclusion, we report the serial CT findings in a female patient with COVID-19. Chest CT showed rapidly developing multiple patchy consolidations and GGOs in both lungs, which were mainly distributed in the peripheral areas. In the later stage, there may be a possibility of development of fibrosis. And with high-resolution CT, it will be easier to find GGOs in the early stage. The imaging findings of COVID-19 overlap with other viral pneumonia, therefore, nucleic acid tests are recommended for prompt diagnosis and treatment.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is a recent outbreak in mainland China and has rapidly spread to multiple countries worldwide. Pulmonary parenchymal opacities are often observed during chest radiography. Currently, few cases have reported the complications of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. We report a case where serial follow-up chest computed tomography revealed progression of pulmonary lesions into confluent bilateral consolidation with lower lung predominance, thereby confirming COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, complications such as mediastinal emphysema, giant bulla, and pneumothorax were also observed during the course of the disease.

INTRODUCTION

CASE REPORT

Since December 2019, several cases of "a new coronavirus infection" having an unknown origin have emerged from the city of Wuhan in China's Hubei province (1, 2). The novel coronavirus was identified on January 6, 2020 and was termed as 2019-nCoV (3); the virus was speculated to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Market, Wuhan. As of February 25, 2020, widespread human-to-human transmission has resulted in 80239 cases in 26 countries, with 2701 deaths (4). To date, there have been few reports on chest computed tomography (CT) findings of complications arising from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. We reviewed a case of COVID-19 pneumonia with mediastinal emphysema, giant bulla, and pneumothorax.

A 38-year-old man from Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, presented with binaural hearing loss and tinnitus lasting for two months. He underwent endoscopic tympanometry on January 16; on the second postoperative day, he went outdoors and caught a cold. His body temperature was elevated to 38.1°C.
Laboratory examination revealed a normal percentage neutrophil count (75%, normal range: 40-75%) and a decreased percentage lymphocyte count (14.8%, normal range: 20-50%). Screening was negative for multiple respiratory pathogens including influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human parainfluenza virus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and chlamydia pneumoniae. The patient's sputum tested positive for 2019-nCoV in a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay.
On January 26, the patient developed a high fever and cough and was initiated on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy. The fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2) was 80%, while the gas flow-rate was 20 L/min. The patient was continued on HFNC oxygen therapy from January 26 to February 4. On February 1, he suffered from chest tightness and palpitation. The arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) could reach 90% after oxygen therapy. On February 5, he exhibited aggravated dyspnea and severe hypoxemia (SpO2 < 70%). He received non-invasive mechanical ventilation in

the intensive care unit until February 10 with symptomatic relief. The initial FiO2 was 60%, while the gas flow-rate was 50 L/min. The modes used were pressure support ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure with 1.18 KPa (12 cmH2O) and 0.98 KPa (10 cmH2O), respectively. Thereafter, the patient continued to receive HFNC oxygen therapy until the last follow-up CT scan.
The initial chest CT showed ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the left lower lobe (Fig. 1A). Over the next 10 days, the lesions increased in extent and density and progressed to consolidation (Fig. 1B-D). The clinical symptoms deteriorated, and acute respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed. A follow-up CT scan revealed emphysema (Figs.1D, 2A, B). After 15 days of supportive treatment, chest CT showed an improvement in the pulmonary lesions, disappearance of the mediastinal emphysema, and appearance of a giant bulla in the left lung (Figs. 1E, F, 2C, D). Eight days later, the final follow-up CT scan revealed a small pneumothorax and pleural effusion in the left thorax (Figs. 1F, 2E, F).

DISCUSSION
Due to its high sensitivity and ease-of-use, chest CT is an important screening tool for suspected COVID-19 patients. The most common CT finding in COVID-19 pneumonia is GGO in the subpleural regions of the lower lobes (5). These findings are mainly seen in the early stages of COVID-19 pneumonia and may be attributed to alveolar swelling, a small amount of exudation in the alveolar space, and alveolar septal inflammation caused by infection (6). Some cases respond poorly to treatment, and localized lung lesions progress to multiple and diffuse lesions.
This case, occurring in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pneumonia outbreak, illustrates the potential severity of this disease. Serial follow-up chest CT showed the progression of the pulmonary lesions into confluent bilateral consolidation with a lower lung predominance. The patient did not have a history of pneumothorax or any underlying pulmonary disease; no abnormalities, such as a small bulla or emphysema, were observed in the initial CT

scan. The patient had no history of smoking. As a result of diffuse alveolar injury in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the alveoli may be prone to rupturing. Furthermore, the patient developed a pronounced cough, which may also induce alveolar rupture. Mediastinal emphysema results from a sudden increase in the alveolar pressure, causing alveolar rupture and air leakage with interstitial emphysema (7); this can be observed in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (8). In addition to the giant bulla, chest CT also revealed multiple bullae in the subpleural lung zones (arrowheads; Fig. 2C, E), where pneumonic consolidation was more prominent than in the contralateral areas, which could easily rupture and cause pneumothorax. While mediastinal emphysema and pneumothorax are well-known complications of mechanical ventilation, the patient only received HFNC oxygen therapy before the emphysema

occurred. Therefore, in this particular case, we speculate that the mediastinal emphysema and pneumothorax may be related to COVID-19 pneumonia.
In conclusion, we reported the CT findings in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed mediastinal emphysema and pneumothorax. Once the signs of these complications are observed during the course of COVID-19 pneumonia, special attention should be paid, and active measures should be taken. Therefore, early imaging diagnosis and timely treatment of COVID-19 complications can improve the therapeutic effect and reduce mortality.

ABSTRACT
In great metropoles, there is a need for a better understanding of the spread of COVID-19 in an outdoor context with environmental parameters. Many studies on this topic have been carried out worldwide. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the influence of environmental variables on the transmission, hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19, even though there are plausible scientific explanations that support this, especially air quality and meteorological factors. Different urban contexts, methodological approaches and even the limitations of ecological studies are some possible explanations for this issue. That is why methodological experimentations in different regions of the world are important so that scientific knowledge can advance in this aspect. This research analyses the relationship between air pollution, meteorological factors and COVID-19 in the Brussels Capital Region. We use a data mining approach that is capable of extracting patterns in large databases with diverse taxonomies. Data on air pollution, meteorological, and epidemiological variables were processed in time series for the multivariate analysis and the classification based on association. The environmental variables associated with COVID-19-related deaths, cases and hospitalization were PM2.5, O3, NO2, black carbon, radiation, air pressure, wind speed, dew point, temperature and precipitation. These environmental variables combined with epidemiological factors were able to predict intervals of hospitalization, cases and deaths from COVID-19. These findings confirm the influence of meteorological and air quality variables in the Brussels region on deaths and cases of COVID-19 and can guide public policies and provide useful insights for high-level governmental decision-making concerning COVID-19. However, it is necessary to consider intrinsic elements of this study that may have influenced our results, such as the use of air quality aggregated data, ecological fallacy, focus on acute effects in the time-series study, the underreporting of COVID-19, and the lack of behavioral factors.

1. Introduction
Air quality is an intensively analyzed topic in scientific research. It has impacts on human health, the environment, and ecosystems. These impacts are mainly observed in big cities, where one finds the primary emission sources of air pollution and higher population densities. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and particulate matter (PM) are emitted through combustion, and the most significant emission sources of these pollutants are urban motorized traffic, household emissions, and industrial processes (Wark and Warner, 1976). These pollutants are presumed to contribute to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought numerous challenges to the current human population worldwide (Li et al., 2020; Curtis, 2021; Vali et al., 2021; Zoran et al., 2022). The people of big cities are especially vulnerable to the risk of getting infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) (WHO, 2021). This is primarily due to the higher population density, which facilitates direct transmission by inhaling droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 (Ali et al., 2021; Oztig and Askin, 2020). But research conducted in China, Italy, England, the United States, etc. also suspects that air-borne transmission of COVID-19 is a possible pathway for infections of big city inhabitants and that acute and chronic exposure to air pollution could play a significant role in COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions, ICU admissions, case fatality rates, mortality, prevalence and incidence (Zhu et al., 2020; Conticini et al., 2020; Setti et al., 2020; Travaglio et al., 2021; C. Wu et al., 2020; X. Wu et al., 2020).
There are three known ways infectious exposure to respiratory fluids carrying SARS-Cov-2 can lead to a new infection: (1) the inhalation of air carrying very fine droplets and aerosol particles (<9 m) containing SARS-Cov-2, (2) deposition of large droplets (>20 m) onto the exposed mucous membrane and (3) touching infected inanimate surfaces followed by getting into contact with the mucous membrane (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC, 2021). Although the second way has been established as the most common for COVID-19 infections, there is growing evidence concerning the first way of exposure. Droplets are released during the exhalation of an infected individual. The larger droplets settle to the ground after an approximate distance of 1,5 m, but the fine and air-borne droplets, which are also released through exhalation, shrink through evaporation, making them small enough to remain suspended in the air for more extended periods (from 15 min to several hours) (CDC, 2021; Van Doremalen et al., 2020). This phenomenon has been scientifically supported by some studies that have proved the aerosolization of bacteria and viruses and their long-range transport across the atmosphere while being carried by soil dust or organic aggregates in sea spray (Yamaguchi et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2010; Aller et al., 2005; Reche et al., 2018). The research of Van Doremalen et al. (2020) indicates that aerosol and fomite transmission is plausible for SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, the risk of infection by airborne transmission is higher in a closed and poorly ventilated environment than outdoors, and the infection risk decreases over time and with the distance the droplets travel. Aerosol droplets mix with the airstream and become diluted within it. In addition, there is a loss of viral viability and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 over time due to environmental factors (e.g., temperature, absolute humidity and UV radiation) (Lim et al., 2021). Other studies found detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA on PM but concluded the concentrations were too low to represent a major transmission vector for SARS-CoV-2 outdoors (Setti et al., 2020; Chirizzi et al., 2021).
There is conflicting evidence concerning the possible correlation between air pollution and the number of COVID-19 cases. Some studies find significant correlations and others do not, and biases are present in both types of studies. For the particulate matter of <2,5 m of diameter (PM2.5), its increasing concentration has a significant positive correlation with COVID-19 cases (Curtis, 2021; Zhu et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Petroni et al., 2020). This positive correlation has also been established for particulate matter of <10 m of diameter (PM10) (Zhu et al., 2020), NO2 (Zhu et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Ogen, 2020), O3 (Zhu et al., 2020) while for SO2 results indicated a significant negative correlation (Zhu et al., 2020). The correlation with NO2 may be a proxy for urbanicity (Liang et al., 2020). Most of these studies show

Science of the Total Environment 857 (2023) 158933
a positive correlation but are biased due to ecological fallacy1 and possible confounding factors2 that were not considered. A review article from Villeneuve and Goldberg (2020) critiques how some studies were executed and to which biases they are susceptible. Other studies, for example, Lim et al. (2021), found no significant correlation with any air pollutant (Lim et al., 2021). Studies also found that chronic exposure to atmospheric contaminants may act as a favorable context for the spread and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 in a population that is more likely to develop respiratory and cardiac conditions (Fattorini and Regoli, 2020). Positive correlations between COVID-19 mortality and long-term exposures to PM2.5 (Travaglio et al., 2021; C. Wu et al., 2020; X. Wu et al., 2020), PM10 (Travaglio et al., 2021), NOx and O3 (Travaglio et al., 2021) support these findings.
Some authors suspect PM2.5 and PM10 particles act as carriers for the virus through inertial impaction, interception, Brownian diffusion, or coagulation. However, Belosi et al. (2021) disproved the three first mechanisms but found for ultrafine particles (<0.01 m), a not yet negligible but small chance virus-laden aerosols could act as a sink for PM through coagulation. Yet, Belosi et al. (2021) also concluded from their research that the likelihood of air-borne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is very low in outdoor conditions, excluding crowded public areas. This transmission mechanism could be more relevant for indoor community environments, in which further studies are necessary to investigate the potential risks. Although, earlier studies have shown that aerosols could contain biological materials such as viruses and bacteria (Després et al., 2012) and that the infectivity of viruses could be influenced by their interaction with PM (Groulx et al., 2018). In addition, other studies had results supporting that air pollution influences the spread and contagion capacity of some viruses (Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007), such as the avian influenza virus (H5N1) (Chen et al., 2010; Horne et al., 2018), the human respiratory syncytial virus (Horne et al., 2018), or the measles virus (Chen et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2020). Next to Belosi et al., other researchers do support that the contagion and spread of SARS-CoV-2 positively correlate with air pollution. Setti et al. (2020) concluded that outdoors, a cluster could be created between PM and SARS-CoV-2 and due to the reduction of the PM's diffusion coefficient, the persistence of the virus in the atmosphere enhanced.
By looking at the possible explanations for these statistics in the scope of microbiology, one can find that air pollution is an important contributor to pro-inflammatory responses in human cells leading to an overexpression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines synthesized by alveolar macrophages (Conticini et al., 2020). This means that the air pollutants irritate a person's respiratory system and cause lung cells to produce more chemicals (i.e., cytokines and chemokines). This phenomenon triggers the immune system to activate through signals. This process has been chiefly observed with exposure to PM2.5 and PM10, causing the elevated production of interleukin IL-6 and IL-8 and other cytokines in human bronchial cells (Longhin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Pope et al., 2016). Becker and Soukup (1999) also found results that suggest alterations of the macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses to viral infection by PM10 exposure, which means that air pollution also blocks the signals from infected cells to bring white blood cells that can eliminate the infection. This may result in increased spread of pathogens and more viral pneumonia-related hospital admissions (Becker and Soukup, 1999). Exposure to PM2.5 can also lead to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD), infections in the upper respiratory system (i.e., the nose, the nasal cavity and the pharynx) and the lower respiratory system (i.e., larynx, the trachea, the bronchi and the lungs) (Xu et al., 2016). Exposures to other pollutants such as O3, SO2 and NO2 also correlate with higher IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 levels and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) (i.e., cytokines) in patients (Perret et al., 2017; Kurai et al., 2018; Che et al., 2016; Cho et al., 2007). This affects the first line of defense (i.e., the

cilia). The cilia weaken over time due to chronic exposure to air pollution. This facilitates virus invasion in the lower airways, puts the patient at risk for developing more severe viral infections (Cao et al., 2020), and makes patients more suitable for any infective agent (Conticini et al., 2020).
Curtis (2021) analyzed the co-morbidity of COVID-19 with air pollution through bio-monitoring. Curtis (2021) found interesting results for PM2.5, CO, active smoking, incense, pesticides, heavy metals, dust/sand, toxic waste sites, volcanic emissions, and wildfires. These variables were associated with pollutant-related oxidative stress in the airways, inflammation in the lungs and other tissues, and the pollutant-driven alteration of the ACE-2 enzymes in respiratory and other cells. It has also been proven that there is co-morbidity between COVID-19 and underlying health conditions that can be developed through chronic exposure to air pollution. These conditions (i.e., hypertension, COPD, non-TH2 asthma, lung cancer, tumors, heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease, obesity, diabetes, immunodeficiencies such as complications in the early type-1 interferon secretion capacity) exacerbate COVID-19 severity (Domingo and Rovira, 2020; Horne et al., 2018; C. Wu et al., 2020; X. Wu et al., 2020; Brandt and Mersha, 2021; Gao et al., 2020; Leung et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Anastassopoulou et al. (2020) discovered that components of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 determine different severities of COVID-19 while genes related to the initial stages of infection, i.e., the binding to the cell receptors and entry, determine different susceptibilities to SARS-CoV-2 (Anastassopoulou et al., 2020). Tsai et al. even hypothesize that prolonged exposure to atmospheric pollution "could induce persistent modifications of the immune system" (Tsai et al., 2019).
Meteorology is considered to directly impact air pollution (Pérez et al., 2020). Air pollutants are removed from the atmosphere through wet deposition (e.g., rainout, washout), dry deposition (e.g., sedimentation, diffusion, turbulence), or chemical reactions (e.g., oxidation) (Beckett et al., 1998). Meteorological factors are also presumed to impact COVID19 mortality. A study in over 120 Chinese cities found an association between ambient temperature and COVID-19 infections (Xie and Zhu, 2020). In addition, Cai et al. (2007) also provide results suggesting that daily average wind velocity (DAWV) was significantly associated with the SARS outbreak. They also concluded that, to some extent, that daily average air pressure (DAAP), daily average relative humidity (DARH), and daily hours of sunshine (DHS) may have influenced the outbreak as well (Cai et al., 2007). They formulated hypotheses to explain the impacts of DAWV, DARH, and DHS. High wind velocity could facilitate the dilution and removal of the air-borne droplets and thus reduce their suspension time in the air. Lower relative humidity favors the survival of enveloped SARS-CoV on inanimate surfaces and in the air. And daily hours of sunshine are directly related to exposure to ultraviolet light, which destroys virus infectivity (Cai et al., 2007; Biasin et al., 2021). For SARS-CoV-2, Bhaganagar & Bhimireddi performed a high-fidelity numerical simulation of COVID-19 case study in real-time using a HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model and found in their results that air-borne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible and that the transmission and dilution of the suspended droplets are determined by atmospheric stability regimes (i.e., low wind speed, low level of turbulence, cool moist ground conditions). These factors favor the transmission enabling the virus to survive up to 30 min and travel up to 2 km before diluting (Bhaganagar and Bhimireddy, 2020). Also, several studies found out that COVID-19 cases increase in the winter in combination with dry conditions and hypothesize this is due to the effect of the environment on viral stability, transmission, behavior change of people from outdoor activities to indoor activities, and changes in immunity levels (Moriyama et al., 2020; Brassey et al., 2020). In addition, Barcellos et al. (2021) found predictions of higher COVID-19 mortality with low solar radiation in Manaus and drought periods in São Paulo using the classification based on association rules method.
Therefore, the scientific literature has shown paradoxical results regarding the influence of environmental variables on COVID-19 cases and deaths, and varied global environmental contexts where research has been carried out play an essential role in these contrasts. Different methodologies to identify associative patterns between environmental and health and even the limitations of ecological studies also can result in these distinctions. Thereby

Science of the Total Environment 857 (2023) 158933
it is essential to test different methodological approaches in different regions. This paper analyzed the associations among concentrations of air pollutants, meteorological variables and the number of COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions and mortality in the Brussels Capital Region (BCR). We use the data mining approach, which can extract valuable knowledge from extensive databases with many different taxonomies. Many studies have already used this approach to explain several phenomena of great complexity (e.g., Barcellos and Souza, 2022; Silva et al., 2022; Duarte et al., 2016). In this research, analyses were conducted to respond to the following research question: Meteorological variables and the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2 and black carbon observed in the municipalities of the BCR are associated with the number of confirmed cases and deaths for COVID-19?
2. Data & methods
In order to answer the research question in this article, two methods were used. The first method used was a multivariate analysis on Statistica software (version 14.0). In the multivariate analysis were performed a joining (tree-clustering) algorithm and k-means cluster analysis. The second research is a predictive model called Classification-based association (CBA) with the CBA DMII software (version 2.0) from the National University of Singapore. The CBA generates a set of rules from a dataset with several input variables (e.g., meteorological, air quality, confounders and vaccination) and an output variable. This method required the discretization of the data. These two methods used confirmed cases, daily new hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 as outcome variables with seven lag-days for each outcome variables.
2.1. Data acquisition
The data that was collected can be classified in four categories: (1) air quality data, (2) meteorological data, (3) epidemiological data and (4) data of the strictness of the preventive measures taken by the Belgian government in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and. Each of these data categories comes from a Belgian institute that provided the data in the form of excel-tables by mail or on internet. In the following paragraphs the sources for the data acquisition are discussed. In Appendix A a table can be found with an overview of the metric units and the abbreviation used for each variable from this point onward.
The data for the air quality variables comes from the Belgian Interregional Environment Agency (IRCELine). They provided the interpolated daily mean concentration of PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2 and black carbon for every municipality of the BCR in the period between 25/02/2020 and 01/10/2021. Since the data is not measured with individual monitoring stations for every BCR municipality, they used the 4 × 4 km2 RIO calculation method to provide the interpolated concentrations based on an areaweighted average. That method calculates the area of a municipality that overlaps with every RIO 4 × 4 km2 grid. The data is then collected by calculating the gridcell concentration of every overlapping area (F. Fierens (VMM employee), personal communication, 09/11/2021).
The data for the meteorological variables were obtained from the Belgian Royal Institute for Meteorology (KMI). They provided for the period between 25/02/2020 and 01/10/2021 and for every municipality of the BCR the data for the following variables: air pressure, average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, absolute humidity, dew point, precipitation, wind speed, global radiation, direct horizontal radiation, sun duration and evapotranspiration (E. Delhaye (KMI employee), personal communication, 16/11/2021).
The data for the epidemiological variables comes from the website of Sciensano (https://epistat.wiv-isp.be/covid/). From the open data available on their website, the following data was retrieved: Confirmed COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 new hospitalizations, COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations against COVID-19 (shots 1, 2 & 3) for every BCR municipality in the period between 25/02/2020 and 01/10/2021.
The data for the strictness of the corona measures was given through a timeline of all the measures in the period from 25/02/2020 to 01/10/2021

Periods of lockdown and periods with more than two strict measures out of lockdown (e.g., curfew, limitation of two guests at home, closing of HORECA, etc.) were categorized as "strict". Periods with only mild measures (e.g., limits on amount of people in stores, limitation of five guests at home, table limitations on terraces) were categorized as "soft". Everything in-between was categorized as "mild".
2.2. Data preparation
For the multivariate analysis, a dataset was created with 32 input variables which are listed in Appendix A in and 571 cases (e.g., every day between 09/03/2020 and 30/09/2021). All the variables in this dataset are related to the entire BCR, the output variables are confirmed cases, new hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 in the BCR. Seven lag days were added to each of these output variables to allow prediction generation. Also, for the input variables of precipitation, global radiation and direct horizontal radiation lag days were calculated. The sum of 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 days for precipitation and the average of 7, 10 and 14 days for global and direct horizontal radiation. This extra action was executed to compare the results of this research with the research of Barcellos et al. (2021) where the variables of precipitation and radiation showed a significant relationship on COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality in the cities of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Manaus (Barcellos et al., 2021).
For the CBA, the same data was used as in the dataset for the multivariate analysis, but a dataset had to be created for each output variable and for each lag period. Also, datasets for one and two lag weeks were created. There were 21 datasets with daily data (e.g., one dataset for each output variable: confirmed cases [t1-t7], new in hospital [t1-t7], deaths [t1-t7]) which each had the same 32 input variables as in the multivariate analysis, one output variable and 564 cases (e.g., from 09/03/2020 until 23/09/ 2021). There were also 6 datasets with weekly data (e.g., one dataset for

Science of the Total Environment 857 (2023) 158933
each output variable: confirmed cases [w1-w2], new in hospital [w1-w2], deaths [w1-w2]). These datasets each had 30 input variables which are listed in Appendix A, one output variable and 82 cases [2020 week 9-2021 week 40]. The CBA DM II also required the discretization of the data and the elimination of decimals. Discretization is meant that continuous data was transformed into three categories, one for each tercile (high, medium and low). In discretization, some variables were multiplied by 1000. These variables were pm2_5, pm10, o3, no2, bc, global_rad (7d, 10d, 14d), direct_horiz_rad (7d, 10d, 14d) and sun_duration.
2.3. Data modeling
This article comprises two different analyses. First, a multivariate analysis was performed in order to observe which environmental variables could play an influential role in the variance of the epidemiological variables. And secondly, a classification based on association rules was performed in order to extract predictions on the output variables (i.e., epidemiological variables) with a given set of environmental input variables (e.g., air pollution and meteorological variables).
In the multivariate analysis, two analyses were performed. First, a cluster analysis was performed on the database, with dendrogram (joining treeclustering) and k-means cluster analysis. The dendrogram in Fig. 1 gives a first overview of the variables sorted in different clusters based on their Euclidian distance. This analysis allows the verification of which variables have the same characteristics by classifying the variables in different groups. The formula of the Euclidian distance is represented in Eq. (1). Based on the results of the joining tree-clustering analysis, a k-means cluster analysis was performed with the number of clusters identified in the dendrogram. In this case, the requested number of clusters was set to ten to see which clusters would separate and which ones would stay intact compared to the dendrogram. Given a set of observations (x1, x2, ..., xn) with each observation being a d-dimensional real vector, k-means clustering aims to distribute the n observations into k (n) sets S = {S1, S2, ..., Sk}

in order to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares or variance. The formula for k-means clustering can be found in Eq. (2).

where, n is the number of observations, k is the number of sets; Si is the set of observations I; i mean of points in Si and; i,m is (i,m)th unobserved stochastic error term with mean zero and finite variance.
The second method used was the CBA, this method generates a classifier (a predictive model) based on association rules (patterns of cause-effect in the database). These rules are generated in the configuration where if x (i.e., the antecedent value) is true, then y (i.e., the consequent value) is also true. Each rule has a support (S%) and a confidence (C%), these are statistical parameters that filter the classification rules. The support of a rule x  y in a dataset D represents the percentage of records, x and y, which were classified correctly in relation to all records in the dataset. The confidence of a rule x  y in dataset D represents the percentage of records that the rule or classifier was correct. In other words, a rule x  y only holds in D with confidence c and support s if C% of the cases in D that contain x are labeled with class y and if S% of the cases in D contain x and are labeled
with class y (Liu et al., 1998). The minimal support for this analysis was set to 5 % and the minimal confidence to 80 %. The settings used to generate the models in CBA were With Rule Pruning in Pruning Control3 and Use Small Rule in Rule Usage Control.4 Each classifier also generates a confusion matrix. This is a table that presents the classification frequencies for each class of the model (true positive, false positive, true negative, false negative). The correct classifiers (true positive and true negative cases) are represented on the main diagonal. The accuracy of a classifier is the sum of the matrix's main diagonal, divided by the total number of values and multiplied by hundred. The error rate is the difference between a
hundred and the accuracy (Barcellos et al., 2021). Error rates above 10 % were excluded from this analysis.

3. Results

In the following section, the results of the two analyses are interpreted.

3.1. Results from multivariate analysis

The first analysis performed was the multivariate analysis with the two cluster analyses (e.g., joining tree clustering and k-means clustering).
The dendrogram from the cluster analysis represented in Fig. 1 indicates that the variables can be assembled in seven clusters based on the Euclidian distances between the variables. The first cluster consisted of air pressure. This observation was also made by Barcellos et al. (2021). The second cluster assembled all the BCR_confirmed [t0-t7] variables. The third cluster consisted of BCR_sum_precipitation 3d, 5d, 7d, 10d and 14d. the fourth cluster consisted of BCR_precipitation, BCR_rel_hum, BCR_ET0 and BCR_o3. The fifth cluster consisted of all the BCR_new_in_hosp [t0; t7]. The sixth cluster consisted of all the BCR_deaths [t0; t7] and BCR_no2, BCR_pm10, BCR_max_temp, BCR_avg_temp and BCR_pm2_5. This cluster is interesting and requires further analysis because it holds both epidemiological and environmental variables. The last cluster consisted of BCR_abs_hum, BCR_dew_pt, BCR_min_temp, BCR_sun_duration, BCR_cum_days_w/o_rain, BCR_global_rad, BCR_avg_global_rad (7d, 10d, 14d), BCR_direct_horiz_rad,

without losing the prediction accuracy. 4 This configuration allows that during the CBA's rule generating stage, rules with low sup-
port but good confidence be selected When this option is enabled.

BCR_avg_direct_horiz_rad (7d, 10d, 14d), BCR_wind_speed, strictness measures, BCR_days_w/o_rain and BCR_bc.
In the k-means clusters that can be seen in Table 1, cluster number five is interesting because it consists of both epidemiological and environmental variables. The concerned variables are all the BCR_deaths [t0; t7] and BCR_no2, BCR_pm10, BCR_max_temp, BCR_avg_temp and BCR_pm2_5. This corresponds with the results from the joining tree clustering. This indicates that the concentrations of NO2, PM10, PM2.5, the maximum temperature and the average temperature of BCR could act as potential inputs for the prediction model for deaths from COVID-19 in the BCR. No other cluster showed promising results.
3.2. Results from classification based on association rules
The second analysis that was performed was a Classification based on association rules with the CBA-DMII software. Fig. 2 represents an overview of the predictive model's accuracies, and Appendix B shows the models' support and confidence.
For the confirmed cases of COVID-19, the CBA-DMII generated 896 rules from 9 datasets (e.g. BCR_confirmed_cases [t1; t7] and [W1; W2]). These rules were then filtered based on their support (e.g., minimum 8 %), confidence (e.g., minimum 90 %), error rate (e.g., maximum 10 %) and the coherence between environmental and epidemiological variables in their relationships. Two of the datasets generated interesting rules with the CBA DM II program, these were the BCR_confirmed_W1 and the BCR_confirmed_W2 datasets. Both classifiers had an error rate of 0,00 %. After filtering, twelve rules were kept. An overview of the interesting predictive models for confirmed cases is represented in Table 2 and in Appendix B. The datasets for the other outcome variables for confirmed cases in the BCR and the other rules from the same sets either had an error rate that was too high, support or confidence that were too low or the rules were uninteresting for this research.
For the new hospitalizations related to COVID-19 in the BCR, the CBADMII generated 1103 rules from 9 datasets (e.g. BCR_new_in_hosp [t1; t7] and [W1; W2]). After filtering the rules, eighteen rules from six datasets (e.g. BCR_new_in_hosp_t2, BCR_new_in_hosp_t3, BCR_new_in_hosp_t4, BCR_new_in_hosp_t7, BCR_new_in_hosp_W1 and BCR_new_in_hosp_W2) were kept for interpretation. The same filtering properties were used for the confirmed cases of COVID-19. An overview of the interesting rules for confirmed cases is represented in Table 3 and in Appendix B. The datasets for the other outcome variables for new hospitalizations in the BCR and the other rules from the same sets either had an error rate that was too

COVID-19 in the BCR: the concentration of NO2, PM2.5, in the BCR for whom the relation is positive and the average temperature for whom the relation is negative. The relation between COVID-19 mortality and the air pollutants PM2.5 and NO2 is also supported by the studies of Conticini et al. (2020), Setti et al. (2020), Travaglio et al. (2021), C. Wu et al. (2020) and X. Wu et al. (2020). As for the average temperature, Moriyama et al. (2020) and Brassey et al. (2020) observed that in the winter in combination with dry conditions there were more cases of COVID-19. A negative relation was also observed in the multivariate analysis between deaths from COVID-19 and average temperature. This means theoretically, in weather conditions with a lower average temperature, an increase in COVID-19 mortality can be expected. Moriyama et al. (2020) hypothesized this trend could be because of the environment on viral stability, transmission and behavioral change of people between seasons.
The classification based on association rules observed several relations between the input and output variables. A high rate of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the BCR had a rather strong relation with a moderate vaccination rate (i.e., first shot), soft corona measures, a moderate O3 concentration, a high PM2.5 concentration, a moderate maximum temperature, a low dew point, moderate global radiation, a moderate direct horizontal radiation, a moderate average direct horizontal radiation over two weeks, a high amount of days without rain, a moderate wind speed and a high air pressure. Similar conclusions were observed between PM2.5, O3 and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the research of Zhu et al. (2020). As for the meteorological variables, dry conditions combined with moderate radiation, wind speed, and high air pressure seemed to favor the higher incidences of COVID-19 cases. Bhaganagar and Bhimireddy (2020), on the other hand, observed more serious spreads of COVID-19 in conditions with low wind speed, moderate relative humidity and low radiation. The difference in results may be related to climate-specific parameters that differ between this research in Brussels and their research in New York city. Other unknown confounding factors could also be the source of the difference. About the association with vaccination, it's known that the vaccine's effect is more effective after the second dose, and the effect of the first dose may not be very visible. Therefore, applying more vaccine doses will likely improve observed associations.
A high rate of new hospitalizations related to COVID-19 in the BCR had a rather strong relation with a moderate vaccination rate (i.e., first shot), strict corona measures, a moderate concentration of black carbon, a low average direct horizontal radiation over ten days and fourteen days, high global radiation, low precipitation and a low sum of precipitation over two weeks, a low to moderate absolute humidity, a high air pressure, a high wind speed, a low maximum temperature and a moderate average temperature. Here the variables of low precipitations and low to moderate temperatures support the hypothesis of increased COVID-19 cases (and hospitalizations as a result) in dry and cold conditions from Moriyama et al. (2020). Nevertheless, the relation between COVID-19 hospitalization and radiation varies and fails to provide a one-sided observation. Also, the results from wind speed conflict with the evidence found in the literature.

A high rate of deaths related to COVID-19 in the BCR had a rather strong relation with a low vaccination rate (i.e., first shot), strict corona measures, a high PM2.5 concentration, a moderate NO2 concentration, fewer days without rain per week, low and high precipitations, a moderate sum of precipitation over a period of two weeks, a high relative humidity, a low average global radiation over a period of two weeks, a low direct horizontal radiation, a high average direct horizontal radiation over a period of two weeks, moderate average and minimum temperatures and high air pressure. The results for PM2.5 confirm their suspected influence on COVID19 mortality (Travaglio et al., 2021). For the meteorological variables, the results could not be supported by the literature but the impact of these variables on COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations can act as predictors for their association with COVID-19 deaths observed in this analysis.
This research has brought to light some interesting results. The use of data mining techniques can provide useful insights for high-level government decision-making concerning COVID-19 and other epidemic diseases. Barcellos et al. (2021) reached the same conclusion by studying the influence of weather factors and air quality on deaths and cases of COVID-19, by data mining, in three Brazilian metropolises. The greatest strength of this study is the use of these advanced data analysis and modeling techniques. Studies like this and many others (e.g., Barcellos and Souza, 2022; Silva et al., 2022; Duarte et al., 2016) demonstrate the potential of these techniques to support public policies in urban management. However, some limitations need to be considered for the interpretation of the results of this study.
First, for the air quality variables, data is obtained through RIO 4 × 4, this is a calculation method that aggregates data based on measuring points into data for municipalities. This means that the data per municipality cannot be considered 100 % valid. However, this method is recognized within IRCELine as a valid and reliable technique for providing federal data.
Second, the time series studies performed in this research (e.g., multivariate analysis and CBA) focus on the acute effects of air pollution on the COVID-19 spread, hospitalization and mortality. This brings forward several biases. For one, the variance of the air pollution variables may have underlying causes that could have a greater influence on the spread and mortality of COVID-19 than air pollution on its own. For example, in periods of lockdown, the air quality in big cities improved a lot while COVID19 cases, ICU admissions and deaths dropped after a while but in what ratio the reason for the drop the COVID-19 cases, ICU admissions and deaths can be attributed to the decrease in air pollution is still unknown.
Third, the research is victim of ecological fallacy. In epidemiology, this is the failure in reasoning that arises when an inference is made about an individual based on aggregate data from a group (Villeneuve and Goldberg, 2020). In this research, the analyzed data was retrieved and processed in community-level and in BCR-level configurations. This does not necessarily mean that all the individual cases that formed the cases for the output data (epidemiological) were exposed to the same input data parameters (air quality, weather conditions, confounders).
A fourth limitation is the inevitable underreporting of COVID-19 confirmed cases due to the evolution in testing effectiveness and the attribution

7

T. Mathys et al.
of COVID-19-related deaths to other causes. Beyond, some people did not go to the hospital and preferred to take self-medication. This can affect results and also lead to underreporting.
A fifth limitation is the exclusion of behavioral factors from the individual cases within the population. Occupation, people lacking health insurance, underlying health conditions, lifestyle, and viral load that people were exposed to were not taken into account while these factors are known to play an important role in the evolution of the spread and contagion of the coronavirus.
The last limitation concerns the positive associations. Even though these have been established, it is not possible to know in what ratio the associations may be attributed to the possible carrying effect of air pollutants or to the aerosolization of the viruses due to the weather conditions or to comorbidity between the variables.
5. Conclusion
The environmental variables associated with COVID-19-related deaths were NO2, PM2.5, temperature, precipitation, air pressure and radiation. For confirmed cases of COVID-19, the variables with associative patterns were O3, PM2.5, temperature, dew point, radiation, precipitation, air pressure and wind speed. Environmental variables associated with COVID-19 hospitalization were black carbon, radiation, air pressure, wind speed, temperature, and precipitation. Combined, these environmental variables with epidemiological factors, can predict intervals of hospitalization, cases and deaths from COVID-19. These findings confirm the influence of meteorological and air quality variables in the Brussels region on deaths and cases of COVID-19. The data mining approach was able to identify with successfully these environmental variables to predict deaths, new hospitalizations and new cases of COVID-19 in the Brussels region. This approach can guide public policies and provide useful insights for high-level governmental decision-making concerning COVID-19.
However, this research was prone to limitations such as the use of aggregated data, ecological fallacy, focus on acute effects in a time-series study, underreporting of COVID-19 and exclusion of behavioral factors. Especially the ecological fallacy needs to be more considered in environmental studies about public health.
Important gaps for further research are to analyze the effect of air quality and meteorological variables on the spread of COVID-19 and on the biological effects of their interaction in patients separately. Also, the inclusion of behavioral factors can bring interesting results.

Abstract
Background: Online consultations (OCs) allow patients to contact their care providers on the web. Worldwide, OCs have been rolled out in primary care rapidly owing to policy initiatives and COVID-19. There is a lack of evidence regarding how OC design and implementation influence care quality.
Objective: We aimed to synthesize research on the impacts of OCs on primary care quality, and how these are influenced by system design and implementation.
Methods: We searched databases from January 2010 to February 2022. We included quantitative and qualitative studies of real-world OC use in primary care. Quantitative data were transformed into qualitative themes. We used thematic synthesis informed by the Institute of Medicine domains of health care quality, and framework analysis informed by the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability framework. Strength of evidence was judged using the GRADE-CERQual approach.
Results: We synthesized 63 studies from 9 countries covering 31 OC systems, 14 (22%) of which used artificial intelligence; 41% (26/63) of studies were published from 2020 onward, and 17% (11/63) were published after the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no quantitative evidence for negative impacts of OCs on patient safety, and qualitative studies suggested varied perceptions of their safety. Some participants believed OCs improved safety, particularly when patients could describe their queries using free text. Staff workload decreased when sufficient resources were allocated to implement OCs and patients used them for simple problems or could describe their queries using free text. Staff workload increased when OCs were not integrated with other software or organizational workflows and patients used them for complex queries. OC systems that required patients to describe their queries using multiple-choice questionnaires increased workload for patients and staff. Health costs decreased when patients used OCs for simple queries and increased when patients used them for complex queries. Patients using OCs were more likely

to be female, younger, and native speakers, with higher socioeconomic status. OCs increased primary care access for patients with mental health conditions, verbal communication difficulties, and barriers to attending in-person appointments. Access also increased by providing a timely response to patients' queries. Patient satisfaction increased when using OCs owing to better primary care access, although it decreased when using multiple-choice questionnaire formats.
Conclusions: This is the first theoretically informed synthesis of research on OCs in primary care and includes studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. It contributes new knowledge that, in addition to having positive impacts on care quality such as increased access, OCs also have negative impacts such as increased workload. Negative impacts can be mitigated through appropriate OC system design (eg, free text format), incorporation of advanced technologies (eg, artificial intelligence), and integration into technical infrastructure (eg, software) and organizational workflows (eg, timely responses).

Introduction
Background
Online consultation (OC) systems allow patients to contact their health care provider over the internet to ask health-related questions and report symptoms [1]. Their query may then be resolved with a written response, telephone call, video consultation, or in-person visit. Many terms are used to describe this type of technology, including e-consultation, e-visit, and online triage (Multimedia Appendix 1 [2-28])--in this review, we refer to them all as online consultations. We distinguish OCs from "symptom checkers" [29] and other self-service systems that typically do not directly facilitate communication with a human health care provider and from patient portals [30], which may include generic email or secure messaging functionalities.
OCs are considered by policy makers in many countries as a way to address the increasing workload and decreasing workforce capacity in primary care [31-36] while still meeting patient expectations and improving access [37]. However, they have the potential to exacerbate health inequities [38,39] and increase inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions [40]. Furthermore, there are widely recognized challenges in initiating and sustaining the adoption of new technologies in primary care [41].
Although symptom checkers [29,42] and patient portals [30,43,44] have been well studied, only a small number of evidence syntheses directly relevant to OCs have been published: a systematic review of 57 articles on delivering "e-consultation" in primary care largely focused on generic stand-alone applications such as email and video (n=39/57, 68%) [45]; a scoping review of "online triage tools" included 13 papers, 4 of which (31%) were nonempirical (eg, opinion pieces) [46]; and a review of 17 studies of "intelligent online triage tools" focused only on those that used "artificial intelligence" (AI) [47].
Since these syntheses were conducted, OCs have gained wider traction in clinical practice worldwide--they have been indispensable in helping manage patients remotely to minimize the spread of COVID-19 [48,49], and English primary care

providers have been mandated to offer OCs for all patients since April 2020 [50]. Moreover, OC system product design has progressed significantly to become more specialized and technologically advanced [51], with several more empirical research studies published on their use [2-11,52-64].
Given this rapid scale-up and increase in the diversity and complexity of OCs, further insight is needed into their impact on health care quality. Previous reviews have not reported the design or implementation details of the OCs they studied [45-47] despite their importance in understanding the causal mechanisms of how they affect care outcomes [65]. The aim of this study was to systematically review and synthesize the empirical quantitative and qualitative literature in a theoretically informed way to address this knowledge gap.
Objectives Informed by existing theories, the aim of this study was to synthesize quantitative and qualitative research on (1) the impacts of OCs on primary care quality and (2) how these are influenced by OC system design and implementation.
Methods
Study Design We consider OCs as complex interventions and, therefore, synthesized both quantitative and qualitative evidence to understand their impacts in specific contexts [66]. We did not perform a meta-analysis because of the heterogeneous and nonrandomized nature of the included studies [67]. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement [68].
Registration and Protocol The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020191802) [69]. The original title was amended to be less general and more specific to the objectives of the review, and the objectives were amended to focus on care quality.
Inclusion Criteria Papers that met the following criteria were included: empirical studies using quantitative or qualitative methods to examine the

real-world use of OCs in primary care in any country, written in English, and published in 2010 or later. We excluded news articles, opinion pieces, literature reviews, non-English-language articles, and literature published before 2010.
We defined OCs as digital interventions that allow patients to contact their primary care provider by inputting "queries" into health care-specific web-based forms [1]. We included symptom checkers and similar self-service systems [54] if at least one of their outcomes directly facilitated contact with a primary care health professional. We included patient portals if they had a secure messaging functionality that used health care-specific forms [54]. We excluded stand-alone generic communication technologies such as email or videoconferencing software.
Search Strategy
We searched the Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases during July 2020 (Multimedia Appendix 2 [12,53,56,58-60,63,70-73]). Our search strategy was developed from scoping searches of the literature and drew on search strategies used in related literature reviews [45,46]. We searched the National Technical Information Service, the Health Management Information Consortium, and Zetoc to find relevant gray literature, conference proceedings, and theses. We found further literature through citation mapping and in the reference lists of the included papers, searching during August 2020 and September 2020. SD and TC independently screened titles and abstracts and then full papers for eligibility, resolving differences through discussion at each stage. All literature searches were rerun by SD between November 2021 and February 2022.
Data Extraction and Quality Appraisal
We extracted data from the included papers as verbatim text, capturing study characteristics (eg, research design and study setting) and key findings relevant to our research objectives based on the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) framework [74] (Multimedia Appendix 3). We used the NASSS to capture "a rich, contextualised narrative of technology-supported change efforts and the numerous interacting influences that help explain its successes, failures, and unexpected events" [75]. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), which is designed for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies [76]. We scored each paper using recommended quintile percentages as cutoffs and considered any paper scoring at least 60% as of "good" quality [77]. SD and TC extracted data from 10 papers independently, which confirmed high interrater agreement. Following this, SD extracted data from the remaining papers, which were checked by TC.
Data Synthesis
The data were imported into NVivo (version 12; QSR International) [78] for synthesis. To integrate both quantitative and qualitative data, during data synthesis, quantitative data were transformed into qualitative themes ("qualitising") [79].
For objective 1, we considered "impacts of OCs on primary care quality" as consequences of using OCs that could relate to

patients, primary care staff, or the wider system [65]. We used thematic synthesis [80], which involved SD and TC coding the text from the data extraction forms independently line by line, developing higher-level themes through regular discussion [80]. Impacts on care quality were synthesized inductively, with emerging themes mapped to the six Institute of Medicine domains of health care quality [81]: safe (avoiding harm to patients from care that is intended to help), effective (providing care based on scientific knowledge to produce better clinical outcomes), patient-centered (care that is respectful and responsive), timely (reducing waits and delays for those who receive and give care), efficient (avoiding waste), and equitable (care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics) [81]. Our emergent findings suggested that OCs had both positive and negative impacts and, therefore, theme descriptions were edited to be neutral (eg, safesafety and efficientefficiency).
For objective 2, we considered OC "design" as material properties of an OC, such as features and functionality [74], and "implementation" as the way an OC was introduced and used in a particular context [65]. As a design feature, we considered AI as the ability of machines to "mimic human intelligence as characterized by behaviors such as cognitive ability, memory, learning, and decision making" [82]. We synthesized the extracted data using framework analysis [83], which involved SD and TC reading and rereading each data extraction form and then coding them line by line independently--both deductively by using domains from the NASSS framework [74] for high-level themes and inductively by identifying additional subthemes. Through discussion, SD and TC summarized the findings into five high-level themes: condition complexity (health condition and the illness the OC is used for), technology (material properties of the OC and required knowledge for use), adopters (staff, patients, and carers expected to use the OC), organization (extent of work needed for implementation of the OC, capacity, and readiness), and wider system (policy context) [74]. Two NASSS domains--value proposition (value of the OC to the developer, patients, and health care system) and embedding and adaptation over time (learning and adaptation to changing contexts)--had limited applicability to our findings and were not included in the final synthesis. Informed by realistic evaluation [65], we considered our themes as contextual factors and identified patterns of explanations for how each led to the impacts on care quality from objective 1 (ie, "causal mechanisms"). Where appropriate, we considered the levels of OC adoption as a mechanism for how they affected care quality [65]. We used visual mapping to identify commonalities and discordances in causal mechanisms--first within individual papers and then across papers [83]. Where there were discordances, we explored potential explanations where possible (eg, related to the study setting).
The strength and quality of our findings for objectives 1 and 2 were assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation-Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research method [84]. This accounts for the methodological limitations of the contributing papers (according to MMAT assessments),

relevance to the review question, coherence of the finding, and adequacy of its supporting data [84]. Confidence in each finding was designated as high, moderate, low, or very low. At each stage of the analysis, the findings were discussed and agreed upon with the wider study team. BCB reviewed all coded verbatim excerpts from the papers included in the final synthesis.
Results
Descriptive Summary We synthesized 63 papers (Figure 1), including 52 (83%) journal papers [53], 7 (11%) evaluation reports [85], 3 (5%) conference papers [12], and 1 (2%) master's degree thesis [13]. The studies were quantitative (33/63, 52%), qualitative (12/63, 19%), and

mixed methods (18/63, 29%) and analyzed data from patients (16/63, 25% qualitative studies and 18/63, 29% quantitative studies), staff (22/63, 35% qualitative studies and 9/63, 14% quantitative studies), and clinical systems (33/63, 52% quantitative studies). All were set in one of 9 high-income countries, with most coming from the United States (21/63, 33%) and the United Kingdom (20/63, 32%; Multimedia Appendix 4 [2-27,52-64,70-73,77,85-104]). In all, 41% (26/63) of the studies were published in 2020 or later, and 17% (11/63) were conducted after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Examples of excluded studies are those that focused on stand-alone video consultations [105], involved communication between physicians and not patients [106], and were not based on primary care [107].

In all, 83% (52/63) of the studies reported levels of OC adoption by patients and staff, of which 62% (32/52; 32/63, 51% of all studies) were described as "low" by the study authors [86]. OCs were adopted at a high rate in 63% (33/52; 33/63, 52% of all) of the studies [87], including high rates of adoption by certain patient groups even when overall OC adoption in the study was low [14].
The included papers described 31 OC systems summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Multimedia Appendix 5 [2-27,52-64,70-73,85-104]. In 25% (16/63) of the papers, the OC system was described sufficiently to meet our inclusion criteria but not in enough detail to determine specific design features. Of the 31 OCs described, most (23/31, 74%) offered two-way written communication between patients and staff [88], with a few (4/31, 13%) also offering communication by video [52]. In all, 13% (4/31) did not provide functionalities for staff to reply to patients via the system (ie, one-way communication only [14]). In total, 35% (11/31) required patients to describe their queries solely via multiple-choice questionnaires (MCQs) [89] compared with 13% (4/31) that solely required patients to describe their queries using unstructured free text [56]. In all, 42% (13/31) had a hybrid

approach of primarily using MCQs with the option for patients to enter additional free text [90]. No free text OCs offered optional MCQs. In all, 26% (8/31) of the OC systems were integrated with the electronic health record (EHR) [58], and 3% (1/31) allowed patients to schedule telephone or in-person appointments with health care professionals themselves [54].
In total, 54% (13/24) of MCQ-based OC systems exhibited three types of AI: (1) adapting questions they asked patients as they submitted their query in response to previous answers given (10/31, 32%) [91]; (2) prioritizing patient queries based on clinical urgency (4/31, 13%) [54]; and (3) signposting patients to an appropriate care provider based on their query, such as self-care, primary care, or emergency department (3/31, 10%) [8]. These were mostly powered by preprogrammed logic and "algorithms" (10/31, 32%) [54], with the exact AI methodology unclear in the remainder (3/31, 10%) [15].
The methodological quality of most studies (42/63, 67%) was "good" (ie, 60% according to the MMAT [77]; Multimedia Appendix 6 [2-27,52-64,70-73,76,85-104]). Common limitations included a lack of detail on whether the OC was administered as intended [92] and small sample sizes [3].

Objective 1: Impacts of OCs on Primary Care Quality
Safety
In 27% (17/63) of the studies, staff and patients expressed general concerns about the impact of OCs on patient safety, particularly regarding the potential loss of information from patients versus in-person or telephone consultations and how it could lead to misdiagnosis [55]. However, quantitative evidence from 17% (11/63) of the studies did not support these concerns in terms of emergency department attendance rates [92],

hospitalizations [70], deaths [88], and other measures [59]. Furthermore, clinicians and patients in 22% (14/63) of the studies believed that OCs improved patient safety, for example, by producing a detailed shared written record of consultations [93] and helping reduce the spread of communicable diseases such as COVID-19 [63].

Effectiveness
In 6% (4/63) of the studies, antibiotics were prescribed to patients at a lower rate via OCs compared with in-person consultations [60].
Timeliness
In 46% (29/63) of the studies, OCs were perceived as increasing access to primary care services. It was easier and more convenient to make initial contact as patients could submit an OC query at any time without waiting on the phone or attending in person [14]. Once a query was submitted, patients also communicated with health professionals sooner as OCs tended to circumvent the traditional appointment-booking process [57].
Efficiency
In total, 52% (33/63) of the studies suggested that the workload decreased for both staff and patients when using OCs. Patient queries were written rather than spoken, incoming phone calls to receptionists were reduced [16], and patient histories did not need manual documentation [93]. Written queries were usually more detailed than when communicated verbally and were received by health care staff asynchronously, thus providing opportunities for more objective examination and more effective triage. Consequently, patient queries could more often be directed to other services or dealt with by other staff members rather than always by physicians [3]. Combined with their remote nature, OCs also gave staff more autonomy over how their work was organized, thus providing efficiency gains such as working from home and control over how to contact a patient rather than defaulting to an in-person consultation [13]. When telephone or in-person consultations were necessary, they were more focused and, therefore, quicker as the staff member could read the patient query before contact [17]. OCs reduced the workload for patients by avoiding the need to telephone their primary care provider to make an appointment, which often entailed long queues [18], and avoiding in-person consultations when possible, which typically involved travel, waiting rooms, and organizing time off work and childcare [15].
In contrast, 46% (29/63) of the studies suggested that OCs increased the workload for staff and patients. Staff described conducting OCs on top of their usual tasks [13] and dealing with them outside normal working hours [19]. They believed that, because OCs increased access to primary care, patients sought help more readily than they would have previously [17], thus creating "supply-induced demand" [108]. Processing OCs also created new administrative work such as filing them to EHRs and deciding whether they required input from a clinician [86]. Workload could also increase for patients if they perceived that entering their query into the OC system was more difficult than explaining it verbally [20].
OCs decreased costs for providers in 32% (20/63) of the studies largely by reducing in-person visits, which have associated expenditures related to staffing and utilities [21]. Patients reported that, owing to their convenience, having access to OCs stopped them from visiting other costly unscheduled care providers [92]. OCs decreased costs for patients in 6% (4/63) of the studies by avoiding in-person visits, which may entail

expenses related to travel, unpaid work leave, and childcare [57].
In contrast, OCs increased costs for providers in 14% (9/63) of the studies owing to associated technology costs [63], time required for clinicians to triage patient queries [22], and insufficient reduction of in-person visits or telephone consultations [87].
Equitable
In all, 65% (41/63) of the studies suggested that OCs decreased equitable access to care services, as their use varied according to patient characteristics [63]. Conversely, 30% (19/63) of the studies suggested that OCs increased equitable access as they helped particular groups of patients who had previously struggled communicate with their primary care providers [14]. These characteristics are discussed in more detail in the Adopters section.
Patient-Centeredness
Although 21% (13/63) of the studies uncovered some patient dissatisfaction with OCs [90], 49% (31/63) found that most patients were at least as satisfied or more satisfied with OCs than with traditional in-person appointments [2]. Patients liked OCs for the aforementioned reasons: they improved access (timeliness), reduced their workload and costs (efficiency), and helped particular groups of patients communicate with their care providers (equitable).
Objective 2: How the Impacts of OCs on Primary Care Quality Are Influenced by System Design and Implementation
Condition Complexity
In all, 17% (11/63) of the studies suggested that OCs decreased staff workload when used for simple queries that were straightforward to resolve as they were more amenable to completion without needing to contact the patient directly via telephone or in person [5]. Simple queries included those related to administrative tasks, new and recurrent minor acute illnesses, prescriptions, tests, requests for advice, follow-up, and some chronic condition reviews [56]. These queries also decreased health costs as they saved clinicians time, for example, when administrative staff were able to relay messages and there was no direct contact between physician and patient [23]. In all, 11% (7/63) of the studies suggested that OCs increased staff workload and costs when used for complex queries such as those with multiple ill-defined symptoms [17]. These queries generally required verbal dialogue with and physical examination of the patient and were usually converted to telephone or in-person consultations to assess the patient further [23]. Staff felt that this duplicated the number of contacts with the patient for the same query.
Technology
In all, 21% (13/63) of the studies showed that, when patients had to use MCQs to input their OC query, it increased both patient and staff workload. Filling out long lists of questions shifted work from the clinician to the patient [20], and staff found them burdensome to read [86]. MCQs limited the amount of detail patients could enter, so staff could not always fully

Darley et al

understand their request. This increased workload as they often had to contact the patient to obtain further information [23]. MCQs also asked questions about seemingly "irrelevant" symptoms, which staff were responsible for assessing and following up, diverting attention from the patient's primary concern [10]. Owing to the restrictive nature of MCQs, patients regularly adapted their responses to obtain the outcome they wanted even when it was not the most appropriate use of resources. For example, reporting their symptoms differently to obtain an in-person consultation when self-care may have been more suitable ("gaming") [17].
In all, 14% (9/63) of the studies suggested that MCQs could also decrease patient satisfaction. Reasons included the amount of work required to complete them [14], their inflexibility in obtaining the answers patients wanted from their primary care provider [9], and that they could be confusing to navigate [25].
In contrast, 11% (7/63) of the studies suggested that, when patients could primarily report their queries using unstructured free text, it decreased staff workload and increased patient safety. This was because patients were more able to fully describe their query in sufficient detail using their own words, and clinicians did not have to request further information as often [95].
In 10% (6/63) of the studies, two-way written communication within the OC decreased the workload for both staff and patients. The ability to reply to patients in writing meant queries could be answered and follow-up questions could be asked at times convenient to both staff and patients, avoiding lengthy telephone and in-person consultations when appropriate [55]. It was also easier to communicate complex information, for example, by sending educational materials or using preset message templates [95].
In all, 21% (13/63) of the studies highlighted that a lack of integration between the OC system and other core software used by providers increased staff workload. Nonintegration meant that the staff had to go through multiple steps to perform a task, such as when filing an OC to a patient's EHR [21].
Adopters
Patients using OCs were more likely to be female (27/63, 43%) [70], younger (27/63, 43%) [91], and native speakers of the official language of the country they lived in (7/63, 11%) [25] and have a higher socioeconomic status (11/63, 17%) [57] than those not using OCs, thus decreasing equity. In contrast, both staff and patients felt that OCs increased access for particular groups of patients who struggled with traditional consultation methods, thus increasing equity and satisfaction with care. This included patients with mental health conditions who became anxious when speaking to health professionals on the telephone or in person (8/63, 13%) [20]; patients with verbal communication difficulties such as hearing loss who found it easier to communicate in writing (7/63, 11%) [90]; and patients with barriers to attending in-person appointments because of physical disabilities, geography, work commitments, or care responsibilities (8/63, 13%) [23]. In all, 13% (8/63) of the studies suggested that when staff and patients viewed traditional

in-person methods as the gold standard, it could lead to resistance in adopting OCs [19].
Organization
In all, 8% (5/63) of the studies found that, when OCs were minimally advertised to patients, it understandably led to low rates of adoption [24]. In all, 11% (7/63) of the studies also showed that responding to a patient's initial OC query quickly led to high patient satisfaction, as it provided an advantage over traditional methods of primary care contact [6]; by definition, this also increased primary care access.
In all, 21% (13/63) of the studies found that the staff workload increased when providers did not integrate OCs into their normal daily workflows. For example, not scheduling time for clinicians to deal with OCs meant that they were done in addition to their normal tasks [93], and not diverting all incoming patient demand via the OC meant that different communication routes were often used for the same issue, thereby duplicating work [5]. In all, 13% (8/63) of the studies suggested that provider workload decreased if sufficient resources were allocated to implementing OCs. This included their initial setup--for example, training to enable staff to more effectively handle OCs [15]--and their ongoing processing--for example, dedicated facilities such as quiet rooms to help staff respond to OCs without distraction [55].
In all, 8% (5/63) of the studies showed that a lack of continuity of care between patients and their known physician negatively affected patient satisfaction. This occurred when any physician could reply to an OC query and patients were not able to specify a physician to whom to address their query [64].
Wider System
In all, 10% (6/63) of the studies showed that government policies mandating OC use increased their adoption. Example policies aimed to increase digital modes of contact with primary care in general [87] and minimize in-person contact during the COVID-19 pandemic [63]. In all, 8% (5/63) of the studies demonstrated that a lack of long-term external financial support for OCs limited their sustainability as health care organizations could often not afford to pay their ongoing costs [23].
Discussion
Summary of Evidence
This review focused on how OCs affect primary care quality, as defined by Institute of Medicine domains, for patients, providers, and the wider system, as well as which factors, as specified through the NASSS framework, influence this quality. We synthesized qualitative and quantitative evidence from 63 studies conducted in 9 countries covering 31 OC systems described in detail, with wide-ranging functionalities including AI. In all, 41% (26/63) of the studies were published in 2020 onward, and 17% (11/63) were published after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our main findings were that OCs are safe and have positive impacts on care quality, including increased access to care and decreased patient costs. However, they can have conflicting impacts on provider costs, staff and patient workloads, patient satisfaction, and care equity. We found that

the impacts OCs have on care quality are determined by the complexity of the patient queries they are used for, the design of the OC technology itself, the characteristics of staff and patient users, the way OCs are implemented by health care providers, and wider health policies.
Comparison of Findings With Other Reviews
Consistent with previous reviews relevant to OCs, we found a limited demographic of patients using OCs, leading to potential inequitable care [45,46]. We also found that the studies often did not sufficiently explore patients' perspectives of OCs in depth [46]; only 14% (9/63) of the studies used interview-based methods with an average sample size of 24.5 (SD 10.14). This hampered efforts to understand how such inequities arose.
Contrary to previous reviews, we found that OC impacts on care quality are more complex and nuanced than previously reported [45-47]. For example, we identified mixed findings regarding their impact on workload, patient satisfaction, and equitable care. This contrasts with previous reviews, where OCs only increased [47] or had no impact [45] on workload, decreased patient safety [45,47], and increased inequity [45-47].
These new findings for OCs may be partly explained because 76% (48/63) of the included studies had not been covered by these previous reviews. Although there was some overlap of papers (7/57, 12% of papers [45]; 7/13, 54% of papers [46]; and 4/17, 24% of papers [47]), most did not meet our inclusion criteria as they were either nonempirical (4/57, 7% [45]; 4/13, 31% [46]; and 4/17, 24% [47]), published before 2010 (26/57, 46% [45] and 2/17, 12% [47]), not based on real-world primary care (16/57, 28% [45]; 1/13, 8% [46]; and 6/17, 35% [47]), or did not meet our functional definition of an OC (39/57, 68% [45]; 2/13, 15% [46]; and 6/17, 35% [47]; eg, symptom checkers with no link to a health professional [28]).
By focusing on design and implementation, we identified new ways in which OCs affect primary care quality. For example, we found that, by increasing access, OCs can increase staff workload by creating "supply-induced demand" [17,108] and that they can decrease workload by enabling more focused consultations [17]. Furthermore, as previous reviews often did not analyze the design or implementation of OCs [45-47], we identified influential factors that have not been previously described. For example, although some reviews identified increased workload when clinicians received insufficient patient information via an OC system [46], we found that this was particularly associated with MCQ-based OCs [23]. We identified

that allowing patients to describe their queries using unstructured free text had the opposite effect [95] while also having a positive impact on patient safety [55]. Using unstructured free text means that patients can more fully describe their query in addition to allowing them to freely express their ideas, concerns, and expectations, as is common in patient-centered primary care consultations [109].
Strengths and Limitations
As evidenced by the range of examples in Multimedia Appendix 1, we adopted a fundamental functional definition of OCs rather than relying on the names given to them by the authors of the included studies. When combined with our comprehensive searches across multiple databases and inclusion of gray literature, we identified more empirical studies relevant to OCs than any previous evidence synthesis on the topic [45-47]. Combined with our focus on causal mechanisms, this helped us develop a new and theoretically informed understanding of OCs that has not been previously reported.
As in all systematic reviews, our synthesis is reliant on what the study authors reported. OC features were not always described in sufficient detail to understand how they affected care quality [62]. There was also a lack of patient perspective in the studies, particularly from OC nonusers [4]. We made our literature search strategy as inclusive as possible regarding the different terms used for OCs (Multimedia Appendix 1) but, owing to their wide-ranging nature, it is possible that some papers were missed. We updated our searches between November 2021 and February 2022 to capture more recently published studies but, owing to time constraints, only 1 author (SD) screened these newer papers. This enabled us to capture studies conducted in the context of COVID-19 (11/63, 17% of all included studies).
Implications for Practice and Research
Overview
Our findings show that the impacts of OCs on care quality are complex and can be influenced by the subtle ways in which OCs are designed and implemented. To maximize their benefit for patients and staff, we therefore provide recommendations for OC developers on how systems could be designed, health care organizations on how they can be implemented and used, and researchers on questions and areas for further investigation. They are discussed in the following sections under the high-level themes from objective 2 and summarized in Table 4.

Condition Complexity
It is unclear whether OCs are unsuitable for complex patient queries or whether workflows and procedures can be better organized and OC systems can be better designed to deal with them. Therefore, we recommend that (1) complex conditions are routed through traditional consultation methods (eg, in person and telephone) and (2) further research is conducted on how these types of conditions could be better handled via OCs to ensure that they benefit all patients.
Technology
On the basis of existing evidence, we recommend that OC developers (1) allow patients to fully describe their queries using unstructured free text rather than MCQs, (2) support patients in providing sufficient detail in their queries for their primary care provider to respond quickly and safely, (3) allow for two-way written communication between staff and patients, and (4) integrate their solutions with existing core clinical software systems.
Technology design also plays a role in mitigating some of the undesirable outcomes we identified from using OCs, including increasing workload and costs. Increased workload is particularly important as it can lead to a mismatch between patient demand and health care resources, which can in turn threaten patient safety if providers are unable to deal with OCs in an appropriate time frame. A way this could happen is through
Figure 2. Artificial intelligence opportunities.

increased demand--if there are too many OCs submitted by patients and not enough staff to deal with them [55]. Whether this additional demand is a supply-induced [108] or previously unmet (and now unmasked) need was unclear from the studies we included [15] and requires further research. Nevertheless, OC systems could help by (1) supporting patients to self-care or signposting them to other services when appropriate; (2) matching capacity to demand by limiting the number of OC queries that primary care providers can receive from patients; (3) supporting workflow, for example, by determining whether OCs require clinical input to relieve the workload of administrators [86]; (4) assisting in triaging patient queries to reduce the associated costs of solely relying on clinicians for triage [22]; and (5) highlighting when patients may require an in-person appointment to facilitate direct booking to avoid work duplication [23], which may relate to patient query complexity.
According to our definition [82], many of these functions may require AI to be most effective, which should be explored by OC designers (Figure 2). In all, 54% (13/24) of MCQ-based OC systems in our review used AI (Table 1) [54], although largely for other functions rather than the aforementioned ones. Furthermore, AI was usually not the focus of the studies, and we consequently found only low-confidence evidence regarding its use in OCs (Multimedia Appendix 8). Therefore, how AI could be used by OC systems in clinical practice requires further research.

The included papers did not always adequately describe the OC systems studied, limiting our ability to determine how their specific features affected care quality. Future research should describe OC systems in detail so that evaluation findings can be usefully compared, for example, by using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist [110].
Adopters
We found inadequate exploration of participant (especially patient) experiences to confidently explain how and why the impacts on care equity arose during OC use. Study authors and health care staff often speculated reasons [18], but this was insufficient to formulate evidence-based hypotheses. Future research should explore the perspectives of patients using (and not using) OCs from a wide range of backgrounds using in-depth qualitative techniques such as interview-based methods. Patients from a variety of backgrounds should be involved in how OC systems are designed and help plan how they are implemented in practice.
Staff and patients resisted adopting OCs when they viewed traditional in-person consultation methods as the gold standard. Although this was understandable for complex queries [17], it was unclear whether other factors also influenced this view. Future research should address this evidence gap, particularly as COVID-19 has made remote consultations more commonplace [49]. In the meantime, this perception could be challenged by explaining the benefits of OCs found in our review to prospective users [111].
Organization
For patients and staff to experience the benefits of OCs, they must be widely promoted to patients as a route for them to contact their primary care provider. This can happen through various channels, such as mail-out campaigns (eg, via SMS text message) or by verbally mentioning OCs when in contact with patients (eg, when receptionists speak to patients on the telephone).
To minimize workload associated with OCs, we recommend that organizations (1) allocate sufficient resources to both setting up and processing them, including the provision of training on how to use OCs, and to staff and facilities (eg, computers and rooms) to deal with them; (2) divert as much incoming patient demand as possible through the system to avoid duplication and increase the proportion of patient contacts that benefit from OCs; and (3) incorporate OCs into daily work patterns by scheduling protected time for staff to deal with them to ensure

that they do not become additional tasks to complete on top of their normal work.
Our findings show that providers can increase access and patient satisfaction by responding quickly to OCs, although the definitions of what this involved were unclear. We recommend providing an initial response to patients' OC queries as soon as possible on the same day--either through written message or telephone call. This does not mean that the entire query needs to be resolved at this point, only that initial contact has been made and the query has been acknowledged.
We included studies from 9 countries, all of which were high-income Western countries. Owing to their remote nature, OCs may play a role in middle-income countries where there are isolated communities and fewer health care staff per head of population. However, further research is required to understand how their technological and financial barriers could be overcome.
Wider System
Governmental policies to promote OCs are effective in increasing adoption, although centralized funding is needed to sustain their use. It is unclear what the long-term experience of such policies is from the papers we included, particularly in response to those relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conclusions
This is the first theoretically informed synthesis of empirical research on OCs in primary care and uniquely includes studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. It contributes new knowledge that OCs are safe and have positive impacts on care quality, including increased access to primary care and decreased patient costs. However, they are also complex and often produce conflicting impacts on provider costs, staff and patient workloads, patient satisfaction, and care equity. Some of these are unintended and conflict with the promotion of OCs by policy makers as a way to address already increasing workload and decreasing workforce capacity in primary care [31-36]. Unlike previous evidence syntheses on the topic, we have shown that negative impacts on care quality of OCs can be mitigated through appropriate system design (eg, free text formats and two-way written communication), incorporation of advanced technologies (eg, AI), and integration into technical infrastructure (eg, EHRs) and organizational workflows (eg, timely responses). Since the advent of COVID-19, OCs have become indispensable, although further engineering and implementation research is required to realize their full benefits.

Abstract
Background: In the post-COVID-19 pandemic era, many countries have launched apps to trace contacts of COVID-19 infections. Each contact-tracing app (CTA) faces a variety of issues owing to different national policies or technologies for tracing contacts.
Objective: In this study, we aimed to investigate all the CTAs used to trace contacts in various countries worldwide, including the technology used by each CTA, the availability of knowledge about the CTA from official websites, the interoperability of CTAs in various countries, and the infection detection rates and policies of the specific country that launched the CTA, and to summarize the current problems of the apps based on the information collected.
Methods: We investigated CTAs launched in all countries through Google, Google Scholar, and PubMed. We experimented with all apps that could be installed and compiled information about apps that could not be installed or used by consulting official websites and previous literature. We compared the information collected by us on CTAs with relevant previous literature to understand and analyze the data.
Results: After screening 166 COVID-19 apps developed in 197 countries worldwide, we selected 98 (59%) apps from 95 (48.2%) countries, of which 63 (66.3%) apps were usable. The methods of contact tracing are divided into 3 main categories: Bluetooth, geolocation, and QR codes. At the technical level, CTAs face 3 major problems. First, the distance and time for Bluetooth- and geolocation-based CTAs to record contact are generally set to 2 meters and 15 minutes; however, this distance should be lengthened, and the time should be shortened for more infectious variants. Second, Bluetooth- or geolocation-based CTAs also face the problem of lack of accuracy. For example, individuals in 2 adjacent vehicles during traffic jams may be at a distance of 2 meters to make the CTA trace contact, but the 2 users may actually be separated by car doors, which could prevent transmission and infection. In addition, we investigated infection detection rates in 33 countries, 16 (48.5%) of which had significantly low infection detection rates, wherein CTAs could have lacked effectiveness in reducing virus propagation. Regarding policy, CTAs in most countries can only be used in their own countries and lack interoperability among other countries. In addition, 7 countries have already discontinued CTAs, but we believe that it was too early to discontinue them. Regarding user acceptance, 28.6% (28/98) of CTAs had no official source of information that could reduce user acceptance.
Conclusions: We surveyed all CTAs worldwide, identified their technological policy and acceptance issues, and provided solutions for each of the issues we identified. This study aimed to provide useful guidance and suggestions for updating the existing CTAs and the subsequent development of new CTAs.

KEYWORDS COVID-19; contact-tracing app; digital contact tracing; mobile phone

Introduction
Background
COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019 [1,2]. In previous research, the mean reproductive number of COVID-19 was 3.28, which was higher than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome [3]. COVID-19 has a relatively high reproductive number and an initial estimated case fatality rate of 5.6% [4]. As of May 2022, a total of 525 million cases have been confirmed by government agencies worldwide, and more than 6.2 million deaths have been reported [5]. In addition, COVID-19 has considerably affected various service sectors such as tourism [6].
Transmission of COVID-19 is mainly because of airborne transmission of the virus; thus, surface disinfectants, hand hygiene, wearing a mask, ventilation, maintaining social distance, and rapid tracing and notification of potentially infected persons are crucial to prevent infection spread [7,8]. Contact tracing, followed by the prompt isolation of close contacts of an infected individual, is another strategy for preventing virus propagation. Therefore, for tracing infected persons, many countries have launched several digital contact tracing (DCT) methods to supplement manual contact tracing (MCT) [9]. As mobile phones are indispensable in today's society, several nations have implemented mobile phone-based contact-tracing apps (CTAs) to alert people who have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2. Currently, despite widespread vaccination in some countries, many parts of the world remain unvaccinated. Even in highly vaccinated countries, COVID-19 continues to cause increased mortality and high levels of infections every 3 to 6 months. The widespread and effective use of CTAs may allow most people to return to their jobs, social events, and family life in capacities similar to those before the pandemic, implying less future morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. In addition, for diseases other than COVID-19 that are transmitted through close contact in the current (eg, monkeypox, Ebola, and COVID-19) and potential future outbreaks, CTA can be used to trace contacts. For example, CTAs have already been used to trace Ebola worldwide, serving as a precedent for mobile phone apps being used to trace contacts for diseases other than COVID-19.
Moreover, because some CTAs register personal information and collect user location data, the protection of personal privacy is an important issue facing CTAs. People worldwide have different attitudes regarding whether governments should protect personal privacy. A study showed that only 6% of people in the United States were very confident, and 25% were somewhat confident that the US government protected data privacy [10]. By contrast, a survey showed that in 2021, a total of 91% of Chinese respondents said that they trusted the Chinese government, the highest rate among the 28 countries surveyed, with a global average of only 52% of respondents saying that they trusted their governments [11]. Another study showed that 37.6% of the Chinese respondents investigated lacked privacy

trust in the government [12]. In general, Chinese people have far more trust in their government's ability to protect their privacy than people in the United States do. This trust may lead to a higher acceptance of CTAs in China than in the United States. Additionally, people in countries with lower economic living standards tend to have lower web-based concerns about private personal information than those living in low-income countries [13]. Differences in people's privacy concerns and trust in the ability of governments to protect privacy in different countries can lead to large differences in the acceptance of CTAs.
Literature Review
Previous studies have assessed the effectiveness of CTAs in single countries, including Finland, Switzerland, and Australia [14-16]. Since our study was an international study, it was extremely difficult to assess the effectiveness of all CTAs using the same research method. Therefore, this study focuses on identifying the theoretical and technical issues that may affect the effectiveness of CTAs and offers suggestions for addressing them. A previous study showed that different countries have different data protection policies that prevent most CTAs from being used in other countries like they are used in their own country [17]. However, this study did not mention the extent of interoperability of CTAs or list specific interoperable CTAs. Previous studies in Europe, New Zealand, and Japan have investigated the public acceptance of CTAs and the factors that influence public acceptance using questionnaires [18-20]. Therefore, this study clarifies which CTAs have issues that may affect their public acceptance. Several previous studies have investigated dozens of CTAs. A study selected CTAs from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, summarized the technology used in the CTAs, and analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of each technology (Bluetooth, GPS, and Wi-Fi) [21]. Another study categorized CTAs by underlying technology and investigated the number of CTA installations and the privacy design and public acceptance [22]. A third study analyzed the different technologies for implementing contact tracing using centralized, decentralized, and hybrid protocols and analyzed privacy issues at the technical level [23]. In addition, several previous studies have compared CTAs around the world [24-26]. However, no study has exhaustively investigated every CTA worldwide or the respective technologies used. CTAs in different countries or continents have various shortcomings, owing to differences in regional characteristics and national policies and the use of different technologies. In contrast to studies that have investigated several CTAs, this study investigated nearly every available CTA and identified common issues across CTAs.
Study Aims
In this study, we aimed to survey all the CTAs launched in the 197 countries recognized by the United Nations. To the best of our knowledge, this study has investigated the largest number of CTAs and countries to date; we have also categorized and evaluated the features and functions of each CTA by practically using of each CTA, read the description of each CTA, and

combined this information with findings from previous research to summarize the known problems and challenges of the CTAs in terms of technical issues, effectiveness, user acceptance, policies, and privacy and given possible solutions for each of these issues. We aimed to provide information for future CTA development and make recommendations for improving CTAs. Governments, health authorities, and technical teams in countries that have already launched CTAs may update and improve the CTAs by following our recommendations, such as extending the tracing distance of Bluetooth-based CTAs and enhancing the cross-border interoperability of CTAs. Countries that have not yet launched CTAs may design them based on the findings of our research.
Methods
Overview
The methodology was divided into 2 parts: data collection and data analysis. The data collected in this study included the countries that launched their own CTAs, basic information about these CTAs, and the detection rates of COVID-19 in these countries. For data analysis, we used a literature study to compare our collected data with the results of previous studies;

we aimed to determine the problems associated with CTAs and ways to improve them.
CTA Data Collection Method
To determine the countries that developed COVID-19 apps and collect information on these apps initially, we used Google, Google Scholar, and PubMed to search the keywords of the "country names" of the 197 countries recognized by the United Nations and "COVID-19 contact tracing app," "digital contact tracing," "COVID-19 app," and "mobile applications" in combination. We searched the databases from December 9, 2019 (when COVID-19 was officially confirmed), to March 15, 2022. Only the first 5 pages of the search results were considered because information on the pages thereafter was not relevant to this research. After searching a combination of country names and keywords, we identified the following 3 inclusion criteria based on which the country that was searched for launched its own app. All COVID-19 apps that could be installed during initial data collection were installed and used on the Android system (Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra) and iOS system (iPhone 11 Pro Max) mobile phones of the first author LMX. The initial collection of COVID-19 apps followed the exclusion criteria for secondary screening. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Textbox 1.

Textbox 1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for contact-tracing apps (CTAs); search keywords: "country names," "COVID-19 contact tracing app," "digital contact tracing," "COVID-19 app," and "mobile apps."

Inclusion criteria
· Google search results contained information from the government or the health department of the respective country about the COVID-19 app, such as an official website developed by the government.
· Google Scholar and PubMed search results showed published literature indicating that the country launched its own COVID-19 apps.
· Google search results did not contain information from the government or the health department, but there were news reports regarding COVID-19 app use in the country. We searched names of the COVID-19 apps mentioned in news reports on Google, Google Scholar, and PubMed, and the search results satisfied the first 2 criteria.

Exclusion criteria
· The app could not be installed with contact-tracing functionality for practical use.
· The app could not be installed or used, but a description of the contact-tracing function of the app could be found on the official website or in literature.
· Apps that were not CTAs, such as the official app launched by Timor-Leste for COVID-19 education.
· Regions that were not among the 197 United Nations-recognized countries were excluded from the study (eg, the British Gibraltar region, despite launching its own CTA, was excluded from this study because the region is not a sovereign state).
· CTAs that were not available in all parts of a country (eg, nonnational CTAs launched by each state government in the United States such as HMushrif, which was only used to trace isolated people and required a bracelet in Oman, and Msafari, which could only trace users in public transportation in Kenya).

Information in languages other than English, Chinese, and Japanese from government and health departments was translated using Google Translate for reading and comprehension. News reports in languages other than English, Chinese, and Japanese were not included in this study during the Google search. Although using each app, it was found that some did not support English, Chinese, or Japanese; for example, many apps from South American countries only supported Spanish. The relevant words or sentences were translated through screenshots using the translation software, DeepL Translate (DeepL SE) and Google Translate.

In this study, information on all CTAs was collected after secondary screening through practical use, consulting official websites, and literature. This information included the technology used by each CTA, whether there was an official website containing information on CTAs, whether they had interoperability with CTAs in other countries, and the COVID-19 detection rate in the country that launched the CTA. The information was first collected through the practical use of the installed CTAs. Regarding CTAs that were installed but could not be used for various reasons (such as the absence of a mobile phone number in the country they were launched) and

those that could not be installed, relevant literature and information from the government or health departments was referred to supplement the information gathered by us on these CTAs. The information on CTAs may be outdated in previous literature; thus, even if our results are inconsistent with those of official government or health departments or previous literature, they can be used clinically.
Data Analysis Through Literature Study
In this research, the information obtained by the method described in the CTA Data Collection Method section was integrated with the findings of previous research and analyzed, and the problems and challenges of the investigated CTAs were summarized.
Results
Basic Information of CTAs
After searching keywords through Google, Google Scholar, and PubMed, 64.5 % (127/197) of the countries were found to have launched 166 COVID-19 apps. Excluding 34 nonnational apps, 9 of the remaining apps were not CTAs; 25 apps have been reported to have been used for contact tracing, but they could not be used practically or did not have sufficient evidence (official websites or research papers) regarding contact tracing. Finally, 98 apps developed by 95 countries with sufficient evidence of a contact-tracing function were identified (Multimedia Appendix 1 and Figure 1). China, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan each had 2 CTAs that were used for contact tracing. A flow diagram depicting the screening procedure is shown in Figure 2.
Among the 95 countries with CTAs, Asian countries had the highest number of CTAs (35/95, 36.8%), whereas Oceania and South America each had the lowest number of CTAs (6/95, 6.3%). Regarding the number of countries with CTAs as a percentage of all countries on a continent, Asia had the highest percentage (35/48, 72.9%), and Africa had the lowest (9/54, 16.7%). The number of CTAs that could be practically used on either Android or iOS systems was 63, accounting for 64.3% (63/98) of all the CTAs. In the remaining CTAs (37/98, 37.8%), the app could not be used because it could not be installed, requiring mobile phone number in a specific country or personal ID, or it could be installed but could not be opened or crashed after opening. After testing all the available CTAs and investigating the introductory information from official websites or previous literature for the nonavailable CTAs, we found that the technologies used for contact tracing could be divided into 3 main categories: Bluetooth, geolocation, and QR code. Bluetooth was the most widely used technology, used in 71 (72.4%) of the 98 CTAs; 35 (35.7%) CTAs used geolocation, and 21 (21.4%) used QR codes (Multimedia Appendix 1). Of the 98 CTAs included in this study, 45 (45.9%) required the

registration of personal information, 42 (42.8%) did not, and for 11 (11.2%) CTAs, this information was unknown. The personal information required most often included data such as name, mobile phone number, government identification number, date of birth, and address (Multimedia Appendix 1).
Regarding the interoperability of CTAs among different countries, 17 national CTAs could be operated in different countries. Table 1 shows specific information on the CTAs that had interoperability and the CTAs that could be operated. Of these, 16 were CTAs in EU countries; these CTAs are generally available and can be operated in >10 countries in the European Union. The only CTA other than the CTAs in EU countries that had interoperability was the careFIJI (CTA of Fiji), which can be used in New Zealand.
In addition to collecting information on CTAs, we investigated the estimated COVID-19 infection detection rate (percentage of positives detected to the number of true positives) based on the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model in countries with CTAs; the data were available for 33 countries (Table 2). The highest detection rate was observed in Iceland (52%), and the lowest was observed in Myanmar, Pakistan, Niger, Uganda, and Bangladesh (close to 0%).
Detection rate means percentage of positives detected to the number of true positives. Of the 98 CTAs, 85 (87%) had official websites created by their respective governments, health departments, or developers (Multimedia Appendix 2). In the CTA information available in Multimedia Appendix 2, yes indicates that the official website includes a CTA guide, functions of the CTA, and other CTA-related information, with a total of 70 CTAs; no indicates CTAs with official websites, but without any introduction in official websites, with a total of 15 CTAs; unknown indicates CTAs without official websites, with a total of 13 CTAs. Investigating the download number data for 2022 for each CTA was difficult; only the 2020 download data were available for most CTAs. Of the countries for which download number data were available for 2022, WeChat (a Chinese CTA) had the highest percentage of downloads to the total population at approximately 88.8% (1.28 billion/1.45 billion). The reasons for this high percentage are as follows. (1) WeChat is not only a CTA but also a national chat app in China. (2) In China, it is impossible to enter large public places and move across provinces without the health codes contained in the app. Downloads as a percentage of the total population were, in descending order, Corona-Warn-App (45,820,000/84,324,494, 54.3%; Germany), NHS COVID-19 (31,044,213/68,605,590, 45.3%; United Kingdom), CoronaMelder (5,864,547/17,211,368, 34.1%; the Netherlands), COCOA (37,340,000/125,695,455, 29.7%; Japan), Koronavilkku (1,311,220/5,506,784, 23.8%; Finland), Radar COVID (8,568,514/46,791,314, 18.3%; Spain), and Aarogya Setu (216,800,000/1,407,993,700, 15.4%; India).

Discussion
Principal Findings
The principle of Bluetooth-based CTAs for contact tracing is that when 2 users with smartphones come into proximity, the CTA records the contact, and the contact record is retained for a certain number of days depending on the presettings of the CTA, usually 14 or 21 days. During this period, if one of the users tests positive for COVID-19, the user will either voluntarily or compulsorily be registered as positive in the CTA. The user who was in close contact with the COVID-19 positive

user will be sent an alert notification on their smartphone. The protocols developed based on Bluetooth technology include BlueTrace, DP-3T, Google or Apple Exposure Notification, Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing, and OpenCovidTrace [9], which differ in the centralization or decentralization in data collection.
Governments can develop their own CTAs based on any of these protocols and determine the specific time and distance for which that proximity will be recorded for the respective CTAs. In this study, 71 CTAs using Bluetooth to record the specific time and distance of contact were investigated; the time and

distance data were available for 21 (29.6%) CTAs (Table 3). The shortest contact distance recorded was 1 meter for COCOA (CTA of Japan) and the longest contact distance recorded was 5 meters for Self Safety (CTA of Uzbekistan; Figure 3). The shortest contact time recorded was 1 minute for Self Safety and COVIDSafe (CTA of Australia) and the longest contact time recorded was 20 minutes for VirusRadar (CTA of Hungary). Of the 21 CTAs, 11 (52.4%) set the recorded contact time and distance at 2 meters and 15 minutes. In addition, some countries' CTAs, such as HaMagen (CTA of Israel), use Wi-Fi-assisted Bluetooth technology for contact tracing.
It should be noted that in Android systems, CTAs using the Google or Apple Exposure Notification protocol request permission to obtain a user's geolocation but do not use geolocation for contact tracing.
Geolocation-based CTAs trace contact in the following 2 ways. (1) Geolocation records the proximity between mobile phone users and alerts those who have contacted a user who tested

positive for COVID-19 and was registered in the CTA, similar to Bluetooth contact tracing. Some CTAs such as Mor Chana (CTA of Thailand) and Aarogya Setu (CTA of India) trace the proximity of contact between 2 users through a combination of GPS and Bluetooth data. This approach can be centralized or decentralized for data collection. (2) WeChat and Alipay (CTAs of China) record the user's geographic location via a cell tower, and the user's health code turns red when an infection outbreak occurs in a city or region that the user visited in the past 14 days. This approach is typically centralized for data collection.
The principle of CTAs using QR codes to trace contacts is as follows: when a user wants to enter a public place (eg, supermarket, restaurant, or movie theater), the user will either volunteer or be instructed to scan the QR code set up in the public place to record check in and if the user tests positive for COVID-19, the public place that they visited will be classified as a high-risk area. Other users who visited the same area will be notified through an alarm or a red health code in their CTAs (Figure 4).

Comparison With Prior Work
Regarding contact-tracing distance and effectiveness, the criteria for the time and distance of proximity set by Bluetooth-based CTAs vary among countries. Regarding the safe social distance for preventing the spread of COVID-19, previous research has shown that 1.6 to 3.0 meters is a safe social distance for the airborne transmission of large droplets exhaled during speech, whereas the distance can reach 8.2 meters if all droplets are

considered; furthermore, a social distance of 2 meters is not effective in preventing the spread of infection. [8,29]. Moreover, infectivity varies among different variants of viruses; earlier viruses are usually considered to be the least infectious, while the Alpha variants are considered to be 50% more infectious than the earlier strains, and the Delta variants are considered to be 60% more infectious than the Alpha variants [30]. By contrast, the Omicron variant, recognized by the World Health Organization on November 26, 2021, is considered to be the

most infectious variant to date and is >10 times more infectious than earlier strains or 2.8 times more infectious than the Delta variants [31]. Omicron variant transmission was simulated by a Japanese research team in February 2022 using the supercomputer Fugaku. The results showed that while talking without a mask for 15 minutes, the maximum and average rates of infection were approximately 50% and 25%, respectively, for a distance of 2 meters between 2 people, and the rates of maximum and average rates of infection dropped to approximately 10% and 5%, respectively, when the distance was increased to 3 meters [32]. The study also simulated the infection rate of 2 people talking at different times, and the results showed that at a distance of 1 meter, 2 people talking without masks for 15 minutes showed a maximum infection rate of 95% and an average infection rate of 60%; for 6 minutes, they showed a maximum infection rate of 70% and an average infection rate of 30%; for 3 minutes, their maximum and average rates of infection dropped to 30% and 10%, respectively. Therefore, to maintain the infection rate of the Omicron variant at <10%, the tracing distance and time should be set to 1 meter and 3 minutes or 3 meters and 15 minutes. Among the 21 CTAs in Table 3, 14 (66.7%) had a tracing time of 15 minutes and 13 (92.8%) of these had a tracing distance of 2 meters. The contact-tracing distance and time settings for these CTAs were 2 meters and 15 minutes, as per the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control guidelines [33]. However, with the drastic reduction in face mask use in some countries, more infectious variants may be transmitted to others at a tracing distance and time much greater than 2 meters and much lesser than 15 minutes, respectively. Thus, current Bluetooth-based CTAs may not be able to trace many potentially infected individuals, because it may have tracing ranges that are too short to identify possible contact and spread. Importantly, in most countries, users who receive a CTA exposure notification are not mandated to quarantine or to undergo polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Instead, with longer tracing distances and shorter tracing times, users can prepare for possible infections after receiving the exposure notification; for example, preparing food and sanitary products before the infection leads to fever and weakness. Thus, setting longer tracing distances and shorter tracing times for CTAs should be preferred.
Bluetooth- and geolocation-based contact tracing face many real-life problems that lead to decreased accuracy or false positives. For instance, in a public toilet, although 2 users with CTAs may be at a distance of 2 meters, making the CTAs trace contact, the 2 users may actually be separated by a thin wall or two, which could prevent infection [34]. Individuals in 2 adjacent vehicles may face a similar situation during traffic jams (Figure 5). In addition, signal absorption by the human body (when the mobile phone is in the pocket); interference of Wi-Fi signals; and absorption, interference, and diffraction caused by obstacles made of different materials in the signal propagation path can decrease the accuracy of Bluetooth tracing [35-37]. Moreover, different CTA detection rules in railways may lead to a 50% false-alarm rate [37]. Some countries have developed various countermeasures to cope with situations that may lead to decreased accuracy in CTAs. For example, the CTA in Singapore records contacts at a distance of 10 meters; therefore, there will often be signals being transmitted through walls,

ceilings, and floors. In response, TraceTogether (CTA of Singapore) uploads contact-tracing data to the Ministry of Health, which processes and filters them based on their duration and signal strength to identify only close contacts [38]. HaMagen requests access to body movement data during initial use to avoid false alarm situations when individuals are separated by 2 adjacent vehicles during traffic jams. NOVID, developed at Carnegie Mellon University, uses a combination of ultrasound and Bluetooth. It is the only CTA that uses ultrasound to measure the distance for contact tracing. The NOVID research team experimentally found that at distances<1.82 meter, 103 out of 187 total experimental samples were correctly identified with an accuracy rate of 55.1%, whereas at distances >12 feet, 225 experimental samples were correctly identified 224 times, with an accuracy rate of 99.6%. Moreover, in real life, the tracing accuracy for a distance of <6 feet would be significantly >55.1% [39]. In addition, the ultrasonic method used by NOVID is effective in excluding false positives even in the presence of obstacles [39]. Therefore, ultrasonic technology has great potential for improving the accuracy of CTAs in contact tracing, particularly at long distances and in the presence of obstacles.
The detection rate of COVID-19 is one of the key factors affecting the effectiveness of CTAs. Low detection rates reduce the effectiveness of CTAs because contact tracing is impossible without a confirmed diagnosis, which is a serious challenge for both DCT and MCT. Previous research has shown that contact tracing barely reduces viral propagation when the detection rate is only 13%, and the effectiveness of contact tracing increases significantly when the detection rate increases to 26% or 37% [40]. In June 2020, the average detection rate worldwide was <10% and varied significantly among countries [41]. Therefore, the use of CTAs may not be effective in reducing viral propagation in most countries. Table 2 shows the data for the 33 countries that have developed CTAs wherein detection rates are available [42]. Even in the latter half of 2021 and 2022, only 11 (33.3%) of the 33 countries showed detection rates of >26%, and 3 (9.1%) countries showed detection rates of >37%. There are 16 (48.5%) countries that have not yet reached a detection rate of 13%; in these countries, CTAs can have an extremely limited effect. Currently, PCR testing is free and routine in some countries such as China and Japan. However, the cost of PCR testing varies greatly depending on factors such as the type of laboratory, country or region, and insurance provider [43]. Previous studies have shown that the cost of PCR testing, cost of commuting to a testing site, and time required for PCR testing can make it difficult for people who are willing to be tested [44,45]. Moreover, the convenience and comfort of the sample extraction method affected the willingness to test [45]. In many countries, PCR testing is expensive and difficult to access. This lack of access may lead to CTAs not being able to effectively trace potential infections and eventual getting discontinued. Therefore, making PCR testing free and routine may increase the willingness of users to undergo the test and improve the effectiveness of CTAs. In China, the following methods were used to increase the testing rates. Nationals who did not have a PCR testing certificate within the last 72 hours were not allowed to enter public places such as shopping malls, movie theaters, and public bathrooms and were not allowed to move across

provinces by any means of transportation. To reduce costs and improve efficiency, China used a 10-in-1 or 20-in-1 mixed sample, in which samples from 10 or 20 people were tested together in a single sampling tube [46,47]. If the result was negative, it was assumed that all 10 or 20 participants were negative. If the test result was positive, the staff immediately individually isolated 10 or 20 samples in that mixed tube for a

temporary period and recollected separate single-tube samples for testing. Furthermore, oropharyngeal swabs were used for routine testing in China and were less painful and more widely accepted than nasopharyngeal swabs [46,47]. These methods have allowed China to maintain a 42% detection rate based on the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model even with a large population of 1.4 billion.

Figure 5. False tracing may happen in 2 adjacent vehicles during traffic jams.

According to our results, of the 197 sovereign countries around the world, 95 (48.2%) have developed 98 apps for contact tracing. However, different countries have different data protection policies that prevent most CTAs from being used in other countries as they are used in their own countries [17]. The CTA interoperability system, which was launched in October 2020 within the European Union, was the first CTA system to remove national operational barriers. The first countries to join this system were Germany, Italy, and Ireland [48]. We investigated CTAs that can be used in other countries as of May 2022; currently, only 17 CTAs can be used in other countries, 16 (94.1%) of which are in the European Union (Table 1). However, with the increasing liberalization of border measures of each country and international travel, the current interoperability of CTAs among countries other than those from Europe does not meet the status quo. International travelers may come into close contact with patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in other countries while traveling on international flights and while traveling in their destination country. However, because CTAs are not interoperable, travelers may not be able to detect transmission or infection resulting from close contact. Since the novel coronavirus has an incubation period of days to weeks, travelers may mistakenly believe that they are not infected until they have significant symptoms. Thus, tourists may spend time in public places for sightseeing, unaware that they have been infected. In this case, if tourists do not restrict their activities in public places, the virus may be further transmitted to more people. Increasing the interoperability of CTAs and removing national barriers among different countries is an important method to avoid cross-country transmission of COVID-19.
CTA policy is no longer stringent. With the increasing number of vaccinations, high asymptomatic rates, and low mortality presented by the Omicron variant compared with initial strains [49], many countries are easing their COVID-19 protection policies, with a trend of relaxation in rules regarding CTAs. For example, according to official information, the QR code-based

"check-in" function was abolished in the United Kingdom from February 24, 2022 [50]. Meanwhile, we found through practical use, the QR code scanning function of the previous version of the NHS COVID-19 app (CTA of the United Kingdom) was removed. Moreover, Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Finland, and Canada have discontinued their CTAs. This implies that CTAs no longer support contact tracing or notifications. However, we believe that this was a premature discontinuation of CTAs because of the following reasons. First, a study in South Africa investigated the asymptomatic rate of different variant infections in 577 health care patients who received a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (2.6% for Beta and Delta and 16% for Omicron variants) [49], and another meta-analysis showed an asymptomatic rate of 40% for those infected with the Omicron virus [51]. According to the data, even with vaccination, more than half of the patients infected with Omicron developed symptoms. Therefore, as stated earlier in this section, users who receive notifications of exposure through CTAs can be well prepared for the possibility of symptoms. Especially in countries where medical resources are scarce, users can contact their physicians and reserve hospital beds earlier. Second, in the 2 years since the launch of CTAs, many countries have shown large CTA-using populations. Among the CTAs of countries that have discontinued CTAs, eRouska (CTA of the Czech Republic) has 1.7 million users, reaching 15.9% of the total population [52], and discontinuing CTAs may cause widespread uninstallation of the app. However, it is not possible to predict whether a more infectious variant of COVID-19 with a higher mortality rate or other new infectious diseases will emerge in future; the increase in the number of CTA-installed users is a slow process that may miss the best time for contact tracing. The official website of Smittestopp (CTA of Norway) shows that people in Norway no longer need to register COVID-19 positivity on their CTA. However, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health still supports the CTA and suggests that people keep Smittestopp on their mobile phones in case infection rates start to rise again [53].

We believe that even if the COVID-19 outbreak is contained, it is better to advise people to leave CTAs on their phones, as Norway has done, rather than to uninstall them.
Regarding user acceptance, a study based on a large-scale web-based survey in Japan showed an increase in the level of knowledge related to COCOA (CTA in Japan) to be associated with acceptance of the CTA. Therefore, sufficient knowledge about CTAs, such as the technology of the CTAs for contact tracing, privacy policy, and data storage time, can be effective in encouraging their use among people [20]. Official websites containing information on CTAs are one of the main sources of information for understanding CTAs. In this study, 98 official websites of CTAs were investigated, of which 70 (71.4%) had detailed information, and among the 28 CTAs that lacked sufficient information, 15 (53.6%) had official websites without relevant information, and 13 (46.4%) did not have official websites (Multimedia Appendix 2). Creating understandable information sources for CTAs has great potential for increasing their acceptance among users.
Multimedia Appendix 1 lists the 98 CTAs that required personal information to be entered at the time of registration. Compared with other continents, CTAs in Europe generally do not require personal information or require only a small amount of personal information. Of the 28 CTAs in Europe, only the United Kingdom and Ireland require personal information to be entered at the time of registration. It is important to note that the NHS COVID-19 CTA (CTA of the United Kingdom) requires information about the postal code and region of address, and the COVID TRACKER (CTA of Ireland) requires the selection of whether the person is aged >16 years. In contrast to CTAs that require detailed personal information, CTAs in the United Kingdom and Ireland do not require a user's name, exact

address, mobile phone number, or any other detailed information. By contrast, 25 (65.8%) of the 38 CTAs in Asia require personal information; most of which require detailed information such as name and mobile phone number. CTAs that do not require personal information have a lower risk of violating privacy than those that require detailed information. However, as nationals from different countries have different levels of trust in their governments and previous literature shows that people in countries with lower economic living standards are less concerned about the privacy of personal information than people in developed countries [13], nationals of different countries may be differently receptive to CTAs that require personal information. In addition, at the technical level, CTAs based on decentralized Bluetooth technology do not require the user's location data and thus are most likely to protect the user's location data. By contrast, location-based CTAs access the user's location data and thus know where the user is in real time. With QR code-based CTAs, the user's location is not known when the user does not enter a public place; however, once the user enters a public place, the CTA records "check-ins" at specific locations. Therefore, location-based CTAs and QR code-based CTAs carry the risk of violating users' location privacy. Figure 6 classifies CTAs by technology and by whether personal information is required, indicating the risk of possible privacy violations. CTAs that use decentralized Bluetooth technology and do not require any personal information have the lowest risk of violating user privacy. Most European CTAs are classified under this category. CTAs that use both location and QR code technologies and require detailed personal information have the highest risk of privacy violation. CTAs in China, Thailand, Brunei, Malaysia, and Indonesia were classified in this category.

Limitations
We summarized the contact-tracing techniques used in 98 CTAs through practical use and through information on official websites and previous literature. The CTAs we used were the latest versions that could be downloaded; thus, our information on contact-tracing techniques was also up-to-date and reliable. However, after collecting information on the CTAs that could not be used practically through information on official websites and previous literature, we found that some information, especially in the literature, was more than a year old; this information could be inconsistent with the latest version of the CTA. The CTAs marked with letter a in the upper right corner in Multimedia Appendix 1 are those that cannot be used, and the sources of information about these CTAs can be found in Multimedia Appendix 3.
In addition, we used Google Translate and DeepL Translate to understand the content of the literature in languages other than Chinese, English, and Japanese and of CTAs that do not support Chinese, English, or Japanese. Google Translate and DeepL Translate were not always accurate. However, the literature in languages other than Chinese, English, and Japanese and the CTAs in these other languages only account for a very small portion of this study, so they do not have a significant impact on the study. In future studies, we invite researchers who can read other languages to help us.
Conclusions
For airborne infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, contact tracing is important to reduce viral propagation, and mobile app-based DCT is an effective tool to assist MCT. In this study, we investigated CTAs worldwide; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate nearly all CTAs worldwide. We combined the results of this study with those of previous studies to identify common issues in the technology, policy, and user acceptance of CTAs. Most of the current Bluetooth-based CTAs have set the distance and time of tracing contact at 2 meters and 15 minutes; however, considering that several viral variants have stronger infectivity than the initial strains, 2 meters and 15 minutes is not sufficient. Contact-tracing distance and time set at 3 meters and 15 minutes or 1 meter and 3 minutes is preferred. Although some low-income countries with low infection detection rates have launched their own CTAs, the CTAs may not be effective in reducing viral

propagation. Currently, only the European Union has developed an interoperable system that allows CTAs to be used in other countries, and outside the European Union, only careFIJI (CTA of Fiji) can be used in New Zealand. Other countries' CTAs do not have interoperability among different countries. Removing CTAs' national barriers and increasing interoperability worldwide are critical because countries are gradually opening their borders, and COVID-19 policies are being implemented less strictly. Creating official websites that include information on CTAs would increase their user acceptance and promote installation; 28 (28.6%) of 98 CTAs lacked access to comprehensive and reliable CTA information through official websites. We examined several practical situations that may affect the accuracy of GPS location; 3 CTAs were found to address this lack of accuracy. Among these, the ultrasonic technology used by NOVID was effective in improving the accuracy of the CTA after several rounds of experiments. We found that CTAs have been discontinued in 5 countries since February 2022. We believe that this was a premature discontinuation because COVID-19 has not been eliminated, and it is not possible to predict whether new variants will emerge in the future.
In addition, vaccination has been shown to reduce infection rates, alleviate infection symptoms, and reduce case fatality rates. Therefore, we believe that in countries with widespread vaccination, users do not need extremely stringent measures such as mandatory hospitalization or 14-day self-isolation after receiving notifications of CTA exposure. Overresponse to CTA exposure notifications disrupts both the daily lives of users and the national economy. However, we believe that the greatest benefit of CTAs is that users who receive exposure notifications can prepare for possible infections in advance. For example, users who receive exposure notifications can wear masks to avoid spreading the virus to more people, cancel unnecessary plans to visit public places, make appointments for PCR testing, and prepare medicines in advance to deal with fever and debilitation after infection. Currently, most countries do not mandate that nationals respond upon receiving CTA exposure notification, but the government or health departments should provide guidelines and suggestions on measures to be taken by users who receive an exposure notification. We created a recommendation list for future CTA updates and designs as well as for policy development (Textbox 2).

Estimating global, regional, and national daily and cumulative infections with SARS-CoV-2 through Nov 14, 2021: a statistical analysis

COVID-19 Cumulative Infection Collaborators*

Summary
Background Timely, accurate, and comprehensive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 daily infection rates, cumulative infections, the proportion of the population that has been infected at least once, and the effective reproductive number (R ) effective are essential for understanding the determinants of past infection, current transmission patterns, and a population's susceptibility to future infection with the same variant. Although several studies have estimated cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections in select locations at specific points in time, all of these analyses have relied on biased data inputs that were not adequately corrected for. In this study, we aimed to provide a novel approach to estimating past SARS-CoV-2 daily infections, cumulative infections, and the proportion of the population infected, for 190 countries and territories from the start of the pandemic to Nov 14, 2021. This approach combines data from reported cases, reported deaths, excess deaths attributable to COVID-19, hospitalisations, and seroprevalence surveys to produce more robust estimates that minimise constituent biases.
Methods We produced a comprehensive set of global and location-specific estimates of daily and cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections through Nov 14, 2021, using data largely from Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD, USA) and national databases for reported cases, hospital admissions, and reported deaths, as well as seroprevalence surveys identified through previous reviews, SeroTracker, and governmental organisations. We corrected these data for known biases such as lags in reporting, accounted for under-reporting of deaths by use of a statistical model of the proportion of excess mortality attributable to SARS-CoV-2, and adjusted seroprevalence surveys for waning antibody sensitivity, vaccinations, and reinfection from SARS-CoV-2 escape variants. We then created an empirical database of infection-detection ratios (IDRs), infection-hospitalisation ratios (IHRs), and infection-fatality ratios (IFRs). To estimate a complete time series for each location, we developed statistical models to predict the IDR, IHR, and IFR by location and day, testing a set of predictors justified through published systematic reviews. Next, we combined three series of estimates of daily infections (cases divided by IDR, hospitalisations divided by IHR, and deaths divided by IFR), into a more robust estimate of daily infections. We then used daily infections to estimate cumulative infections and the cumulative proportion of the population with one or more infections, and we then calculated posterior estimates of cumulative IDR, IHR, and IFR using cumulative infections and the corrected data on reported cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. Finally, we converted daily infections into a historical time series of Reffective by location and day based on assumptions of duration from infection to infectiousness and time an individual spent being infectious. For each of these quantities, we estimated a distribution based on an ensemble framework that captured uncertainty in data sources, model design, and parameter assumptions.

Findings Global daily SARS-CoV-2 infections fluctuated between 3 million and 17 million new infections per day between April, 2020, and October, 2021, peaking in mid-April, 2021, primarily as a result of surges in India. Between the start of the pandemic and Nov 14, 2021, there were an estimated 3·80 billion (95% uncertainty interval 3·44-4·08) total SARS-CoV-2 infections and reinfections combined, and an estimated 3·39 billion (3·08-3·63) individuals, or 43·9% (39·9-46·9) of the global population, had been infected one or more times. 1·34 billion (1·20-1·49) of these infections occurred in south Asia, the highest among the seven super-regions, although the sub-Saharan Africa super-region had the highest infection rate (79·3 per 100 population [69·0-86·4]). The high-income super-region had the fewest infections (239 million [226-252]), and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania had the lowest infection rate (13·0 per 100 population [8·4-17·7]). The cumulative proportion of the population ever infected varied greatly between countries and territories, with rates higher than 70% in 40 countries and lower than 20% in 39 countries. There was no discernible relationship between Reffective and total immunity, and even at total immunity levels of 80%, we observed no indication of an abrupt drop in R , effective indicating that there is not a clear herd immunity threshold observed in the data.

Interpretation COVID-19 has already had a staggering impact on the world up to the beginning of the omicron (B.1.1.529) wave, with over 40% of the global population infected at least once by Nov 14, 2021. The vast differences in cumulative proportion of the population infected across locations could help policy makers identify the transmissionprevention strategies that have been most effective, as well as the populations at greatest risk for future infection.

This information might also be useful for targeted transmission-prevention interventions, including vaccine prioritisation. Our statistical approach to estimating SARS-CoV-2 infection allows estimates to be updated and disseminated rapidly on the basis of newly available data, which has and will be crucially important for timely COVID-19 research, science, and policy responses.

Introduction
Measuring SARS-CoV-2's daily infection rate, cumulative infections, and the proportion of the population with one or more infections is essential for understanding the determinants of past transmission, identifying ongoing inequities, predicting future trajectories of the COVID-19 pandemic, and, in theory, prioritising vaccination allocations. Daily infections are also the crucial input into

measuring the changing effective reproductive number (R , effective the number of subsequent infections caused by a new infection).1-3 A robust assessment of Reffective by day in each location is useful to help evaluate the effect of the wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions that have been deployed during the pandemic. The Reffective over time is also a crucial input into future forecasts of COVID-19.4 Cumulative infections can help us identify

Research in context
Evidence before this study This study was conceptualised and developed from the start of the pandemic to fill a void in the provision of timely estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections for tracking the pandemic and to provide inputs to epidemiological models of transmission. Several research groups have estimated SARS-CoV-2 daily or cumulative infections in select locations at specific points in time. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates cumulative infections by approximating the infection- detection ratio (IDR) using assumptions about the portion of the population who will seek care. The Serotracker project reports on the universe of seroprevalence surveys and some attributes of these surveys, but it does not make estimates of cumulative infections based on these data. Noh and Danuser (2021) used reported deaths and published estimates of the infection-fatality ratio (IFR) to estimate cumulative infections for US states and select countries. To our knowledge, however, no source has provided estimates, either periodic or regularly updated, of global daily and cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections at this resolution (399 administrative units).
Added value of this study This study is the first comprehensive analysis of global daily and cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections to date and improves upon previous infection estimation strategies in several important ways. First, we combined three approaches that have been used to estimate daily infections: cases divided by the IDR, hospitalisations divided by the infection-hospitalisation ratio (IHR), and deaths divided by the IFR. Combining these estimates gave us a more robust estimate of daily infections that was less susceptible to biases within and between each type of measure. Second, estimates of total COVID-19 deaths derived from a comprehensive assessment of excess mortality and a statistical estimate of the portion of excess mortality directly due to COVID-19 allowed for more meaningful interpretation of spatial heterogeneity in total COVID-19 mortality rates. Third, we used a systematic analysis of available seroprevalence data matched in

space and time to cases, hospitalisations, and deaths to empirically estimate the IDR, IHR, and IFR. Because the IHR and IFR are profoundly age related, we also estimated agestandardised ratios for these quantities. Fourth, for locations without seroprevalence surveys, we used statistical models based on the available empirical data and the testing of a wide range of covariates to predict the IDR, IHR, and IFR. Fifth, we used daily infections to estimate cumulative infections and, with assumptions on cross-variant immunity, the cumulative number of individuals with one or more infections, as well as posterior estimates of cumulative IDR, IHR, and IFR. Sixth, we incorporated corrections to the primary data into the analysis to deal with known biases such as waning antibody test sensitivity. Seventh, our ensemble model reflects the uncertainty of the data sources, model design, and parameter assumptions included in the analysis. Finally, the methods developed to triangulate on daily infections, cumulative infections, and the proportion of the population infected once or more than once have been developed into easily applied statistical code, so estimates can be shared and updated rapidly and iteratively on the basis of the frequency of newly reported data.
Implications of all the available evidence SARS-CoV-2 has been extremely widespread, causing 3·80 billion (95% uncertainty interval 3·44-4·08) infections and reinfections as of Nov 14, 2021, infecting 43·9% (39·9-46·9) of the world's population. The proportion of the population infected has varied greatly across countries, suggesting that host immunity characteristics and national and local policies play a crucial role in determining patterns of transmission. Our comprehensive modelling approach provides a database of daily infections and effective reproductive number by location from the beginning of the pandemic to Nov 14, 2021, which can be used to develop insights into the determinants of transmission, identify ongoing inequities, establish standards for vaccine prioritisation, and more.

which nations and communities have been able to keep transmission at lower levels, potentially creating the opportunity to learn from these success stories. Finally, a sound measurement of the proportion of the population ever infected could help to identify which communities are at greater risk of future transmission and might be a factor that should be considered in vaccine prioritisation.5
Several studies have estimated cumulative infections in select countries at specific points in time.6-9 Some of these studies have used seroprevalence surveys, while others have made estimates of infections by assuming a particular infection-detection ratio (IDR).7,10-12 One study estimated infections in the USA and other select countries,13 and other studies have done multinational systematic reviews and meta-analyses of seroprevalence surveys.14,15 The fundamental problem in all of these analyses is that each of the data series observed has potential biases: reported cases capture only a portion of infections, and this portion will be a function of the availability of testing; reported deaths capture only a subset of total COVID-19 deaths, and the infection-fatality ratio (IFR) can vary widely over time and across locations;16-19 the proportion of patients with an infection who are admitted to hospital can also vary over time and location; and seroprevalence surveys can be influenced by sampling design, waning of sensitivity of antibody tests, and vaccination rates. Few studies have combined data from reported cases, reported deaths, hospitalisations, and seroprevalence surveys to triangulate daily infections, and WHO only routinely reports confirmed cases, not estimated infections.20 The use of such sources of incomplete, biased, and heterogeneous case data uncritically in research, science, and policy will result in inferences confounded to unknown levels by these known problems.
In this study, we present an approach to estimating past SARS-CoV-2 daily infections, cumulative infections through Nov 14, 2021, and the proportion of the population with one or more infections on the basis of reported cases, total deaths attributable to COVID-19, hospitalisations, and seroprevalence surveys. This approach attempts to deal with the biases in each of these measures and use them all to triangulate daily infections. With this statistical approach to the fusion of these data streams, we aimed to provide a method that can be applied on a rapid and ongoing basis, so that these estimates remain maximally relevant for research, science, and policy and can be immediately and freely available. Importantly, we incorporated various sources of uncertainty in daily infections into the analysis to help informed assessment of the variation in space and time of the fidelity of the estimates.
Methods
Overview We derived comprehensive global estimates of daily and cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, using the heterogeneous universe of reported epidemiological data (iteratively curated,

corrected, and calibrated into an internally complete and consistent time series at national and subnational levels) to further timely research, discovery, and policy inference. Our approach can be divided into seven steps, which are applied by use of an ensemble model framework. First, we developed a dataset of reported COVID-19 cases, total COVID-19 deaths, and hospitalisations (where available), corrected for known biases such as lags in reporting. Second, we identified representative SARS-CoV-2 sero­ preval­ence surveys that could be used to create a database of cumulative infections and adjusted them for waning antibody sensitivity, vaccinations, and reinfection from escape variants. Third, using adjusted seroprevalence survey data matched to cases, hospitalisations, and deaths, we created an empirical database of IDRs, infection- hospitalisation ratios (IHRs), and IFRs. Fourth, for locations without seroprevalence surveys and to estimate a complete time series for each location, we developed statistical models to predict the IDR, IHR, and IFR by location and day, as a function of a wide range of covariates. Fifth, three series of estimates of daily infections (cases divided by IDR, hospitalisations divided by IHR, and deaths divided by IFR) were combined into a more robust estimate of daily infections. Sixth, we used the combined time series of daily infections to estimate cumulative infections and the cumulative proportion of the population with one or more infections, and calculate posterior estimates of cumulative IDR, IHR, and IFR. Seventh, we converted daily infections into a historical time series of Reffective by location and day, on the basis of assumptions of duration of the period from infection to infectiousness and time an individual spent being infectious. Estimates are given for all ages and both sexes combined for 190 countries and territories, and for subnational locations in ten of those countries, aggregated into 21 regions, seven super-regions,21 and globally, from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic through Nov 14, 2021.
This study complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting recommendations (appendix 1, section 2).22 All code used in the analysis can be found online.
Ensemble framework Our model system includes many component parts that are inherently uncertain, ranging from input data sources and parameter assumptions to model specification. To account for this, we developed an ensemble framework wherein we varied the data and model settings across 100 iterations of the analysis, which were then run independently to yield 100 estimates of infections. These sources of uncertainty include seroprevalence survey error; bootstrapped samples of our seroprevalence database; estimates of seroreversion rates; estimates of total COVID-19 mortality; parameterisation of crossvariant immunity, increased risk of hospitalisation and death from non-ancestral SARS-CoV-2 variants, and durations associated with COVID-19 natural history;

Data inputs and corrections Data of reported cases were obtained largely from Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD, USA),23 with exceptions and additions noted in appendix 1 (section 4.1) and appendix 2 (section 4). Hospital admissions were largely sourced from national databases such as that of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the USA and the Secretaria de Vigilância em Saúde in Brazil (for an exhaustive list see appendix 2, section 1). Deaths were based on reported deaths data from Johns Hopkins University23 and various national sources from locations where data inconsistencies were evident in the Johns Hopkins University datasets (more details in appendix 1, section 4.3, and appendix 2, section 2). To account for the prevalent issue of under-reporting in COVID-19 deaths, we applied a scalar of reported to total COVID-19 deaths in our analysis. Total COVID-19 deaths, as defined by WHO, are all deaths where the deceased individuals were actively infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the time of the death. Estimates of total COVID-19 mortality were constructed with use of the statistical model developed by the COVID-19 Excess Mortality Collaborators to predict the excess mortality rate for all locations between Jan 1, 2020, and Nov 14, 2021.16 To estimate total COVID-19 mortality, we predicted a counterfactual excess mortality rate due to COVID-19 in which the IDR was set to the maximum observed values among all locations. The predicted excess mortality rate from this counterfactual analysis, corrected for under-reporting, resulted from insufficient testing and changes in mortality driven by behaviours such as deferred health care during periods of lockdown. We used the ratio of this counterfactual excess mortality rate and the prediction for the same period as a proxy for the proportion of excess mortality that is total COVID-19 mortality. Subsequently, a scalar of reported COVID-19 deaths to total COVID-19 deaths can be derived (more details in appendix 1, section 9.4). We identified seroprevalence surveys through a search protocol that leveraged previous reviews,24,25 SeroTracker,26 and routine inclusion of national and subnational surveys undertaken by governmental organisations. Studies that focused on specific subsets of the population--either a specific subpopulation such as health-care workers or specific locations such as specific cities--were typically excluded as a result of not being representative. In total, we identified 2817 seroprevalence survey datapoints (of 6420 reviewed) for inclusion in this analysis.
Although most data streams for daily cases, deaths, and hospitalisations are indexed by date of report, some are indexed by date of event; in these instances, lags in

reporting create misleading trends in the most recent days of data. These trends are gradually corrected over time as reporting systems catch up but, to prevent this occurrence from influencing our models, we needed to evaluate each individual data source and determine an appropriate number of days to exclude in any iteration of the analyses.
Some hospital admissions data series only became available starting from weeks or months after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic--for example, the HHS database began in July, 2020. However, total cumulative hospitalisations are required to create our empirical estimate of IHR. In these instances, we leveraged information from the metrics that did have complete time coverage (cases and deaths) to impute the earlier portion of the admissions time series (appendix 1, section 4.2).
Seroprevalence survey adjustments Seroprevalence surveys were corrected for vaccination, because vaccination generates a positive anti-spike antibody test in most individuals who receive the vaccine.27 In locations where vaccination rates have increased over time, population levels of anti-spike antibodies will be elevated. To correct for this, we adjusted seroprevalence estimates downward on the basis of vaccination rates in adults in every location, accounting for vaccination of previously infected individuals (appendix 1, section 5.1).
Seroprevalence surveys provide an estimate of the number of individuals who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 one or more times; these surveys do not detect repeat infections in a single individual. Because reinfection can be common in settings where escape variants such as beta (B.1.351), gamma (P.1), and delta (B.1.617.2) are present,28-30 we had to adjust seroprevalence data to estimate the cumulative number of infections-- that is, to include both first and any subsequent infections. We used a level of cross-variant immunity of 30% to 70% between escape variants and ancestral variants and alpha (B.1.1.7), on the basis of an empirical analysis conducted by the COVID-19 Forecasting Team (unpublished). This estimate did not take into account that some individuals could have been infected more than once with ancestral variants.31 A detailed explanation of how we adjusted for escape variant prevalence is given in appendix 1 (section 5.2).
Lastly, seroprevalence surveys were corrected for waning sensitivity of antibody tests. We identified eight categories of antibody tests; for each of these, we used a reported curve of sensitivity over time.32-34 To implement the correction based on waning, we used initial estimates of the timing of infection based on reported deaths. We did not adjust for specificity, as reported specificity for all available commercial assays included in the analysis is over 95% and mostly over 98% (more details in appendix 1, sections 5.3 and 9.3).35

Empirical estimates of the IDR, IHR, and IFR Using the adjusted seroprevalence data we have described, we created a dataset of 2817 empirical measurements of the IDR in which the numerator was the cumulative number of confirmed cases and the denominator was the number of cumulative infections and reinfections combined. We aligned cases and seroprevalence on the basis of individual record data suggesting that exposure to a laboratory-confirmed case was typically 10-13 days36 and exposure to seroconversion was 14-17 days.37-39 Figure 1A shows these empirical estimates of location-specific IDR over the course of the pandemic. For the purposes of visualising the data, the IDR data are time-localised to the average date of infection based on the model estimate and daily cases.
Using adjusted seroprevalence surveys matched to cumulative hospitalisations, we developed a dataset of 2580 empirical estimates of the IHR. Based on the same data and analysis used to determine the lag for cases,36 we used a 10-13-day lag for hospitalisations. Far fewer locations reported hospitalisations, so less information was available for this metric than for the IDR. We used 703 surveys that included age-specific seroprevalence data to estimate the IHR age pattern, and we then used indirect age standardisation to estimate the age-standardised IHR across locations and used those age-standardised estimates in the modelling of the IHR (more details on indirect standardisation methods in appendix 1, section 6.1). Figure 1B shows the universe of available age-standardised IHR over time. For the purposes of visualising the data, IHR data are timelocalised to the average date of admission.
Using the 718 seroprevalence surveys with age-specific detail, the COVID-19 Forecasting Team40 estimated the age pattern of the IFR. We used this age pattern to create a dataset of age-standardised IFR data using 2817 pairs of adjusted seroprevalence surveys and death data, assuming 22-28 days from exposure to death on the basis of analyses of patient-level data in the USA.41 Time indexing of IFR data was based on the average date of death for each observation. Figure 1C shows the relationship between age-standardised IFR and time.
Statistical models of the IDR, IHR, and IFR To generate estimates of daily infections from cases, hospitalisations, and deaths, we needed estimates of the IDR, IHR, and IFR by location for each day during the pandemic. We used a cascading implementation of a Bayesian regression framework42 to estimate each of these measures (more details in appendix 1, section 6.2). The cascading regression model allows for a flexible fit to the key covariates, including the option to specify them as splines, and borrows strength across locations. After parameterising the relationship of seroprevalence to cases, hospitalisations, and deaths through predictive models of IDR, IHR, and IFR, we

used local covariates and age structure to generate predictions of these ratios in both in-sample and out-ofsample locations based on our hierarchical cascade model. For the IDR model, the most spatially and temporally consistent predictive relationship was

between testing per person and the IDR. To capture the rise in health system capacity to deliver testing, we used the observed maximum testing rate up to a given date as the covariate. Additionally, we included universal healthcare coverage, the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index, and the proportion of the population older than 65 years as covariates that each submodel selected from in our ensemble. These covariates were estimated for all locations as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD; appendix 1, sections 6.3 and 9.6).43
Predictive covariates for IHR and IFR were primarily based on a list of underlying medical conditions identified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as increasing the risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection.44 We cross-referenced this list with a study of individuals admitted to hospital in the USA41 that evaluated the increased risk of in-hospital death to identify seven possible covariates, all of which were included in our models as age-standardised prevalence in the population (estimated as part of GBD): obesity, smoking, diabetes, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.43 Several of these covariates, most prominently obesity, were further supported by relationships in US claims45 and Brazil hospitalisations data.46 To this list, we also added universal health-care coverage and the HAQ Index. We then tested all possible combinations of these covariates and selected the top 100 most predictive combinations to use across submodels in our ensemble models of IHR and IFR (more details in appendix 1, section 9.6). We estimated age-standardised IHR and IFR using these covariates and then converted estimates back to all-age IHR and IFR to reflect population structure. We accounted for reductions in the IFR due to improved treatment over the course of the pandemic by including a spline on time in the regressions in addition to the ensemble covariates (more details on these models in appendix 1, sections 6.4, 6.5, and 9.6).
Vaccines and variants also affect the likelihood of severe disease and death, and thus influence both the IHR and the IFR. First, vaccination strategies that prioritise older age groups before younger ones can temporarily increase the relative proportion of infections that occur in younger individuals, thus lowering the population-level IFR and IHR for at least a period of time. Additionally, COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to confer higher levels of protection from severe disease and death than from mild infection, also serving to lower the overall IFR and IHR. The prevalence of variants with higher likelihood of severe disease and death can conversely increase these ratios,47 and the introduction of escape variants can increase them further by reducing vaccine efficacy. More information on how we accounted for these features can be found in appendix 1 (section 6.6).

Robust estimates of daily infections We then paired the estimates of our ratio models with data that were reported by local jurisdictions--accounting for reporting biases in cases through the testing covariate and in deaths through the total COVID-19 death scalars-- to estimate infections in a manner that was sensitive to local context, even in the absence of seroprevalence data. By dividing cases by the modelled IDR, hospitalisations by the modelled IHR, and deaths by the modelled IFR, we produced three daily infections time series (or two if only cases and deaths were reported for a given location). Estimates based on each input data type were shifted back in time by their respective lags, such that they were all indexed on date of infection. We then fit a time series spline model using all three data sources as inputs to triangulate a best estimate of daily infections. After deriving this mean estimate of daily infections, we sampled the residuals of the intermediate case-based, hospitalisation-based, and deaths-based infection estimates independently in each submodel and refit the infections curve to these data; this enabled us to more accurately reflect the volatility in reporting practices, such as for deaths, in our ensemble distribution of daily infections (more details in appendix 1, section 7).
Cumulative infections and cumulative proportion of the population infected at least once Daily infections, including reinfections, were summed to derive an estimate of cumulative infections. With this estimate of cumulative infections, we then returned to reported cases, reported hospitalisations, and total COVID-19 deaths to produce posterior estimates of cumulative IDR, IHR, and IFR. Where the reported data were not available, the posterior ratio estimate would be equal to the prediction from the ratio model. To estimate the proportion of individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at least once by Nov 14, 2021, we used the same assumptions already described. The crucial assumptions required were cross-variant immunity, the prevalence of escape variants, and the assumption that exposure to escape variants is independent of the probability of previous infection with ancestral variants.
Figures found in appendix 3 show cases, hospitali­sations (where available), deaths, IDR, IHR, IFR, daily infections, cumulative infections, and cumulative proportion of the population infected at least once for 399 locations.
Reffective estimation in the past Using daily infections, we directly estimated Reffective in the past by location and day, where Reffective at time t is:
Reffective(t)= ininfefcetcitoinons(st(+t))
The assumptions required for this estimation are the duration from infection to being infectious and the period of infectiousness, collectively represented as .

We used ranges of 3-5 days for both assumptions to generate estimates of Reffective in the past. These estimates are useful for identifying the effect of different non-pharmaceutical interventions on transmission in different settings. An Reffective lower than 1·0 indicates that the epidemic is shrinking, whereas an Reffective higher than 1·0 indicates that the epidemic is growing.

We compared Reffective to an estimate of total immunity in the population of location l at time t (presented as weekly averages), where this value is calculated as:

Results
Globally, daily SARS-CoV-2 infections steadily increased over the first several months of the pandemic, surpassing 3 million daily infections for the first time in mid-April, 2020, and then doubling to 6 million per day 6 weeks later (figure 2A). Global daily infections remained higher than 5 million per day until dipping slightly below that threshold after a period of decline in

January and February, 2021. Driven primarily by the delta variant surge in India, global daily infections soared to a pandemic high of nearly 17 million in April, 2021, then dropped as low as 6 million by June, 2021, before delta variant waves in other parts of the world led to another global surge peaking at over 8 million infections per day in July, 2021. This peak was followed by the longest sustained decline of the pandemic at the global level, wherein global infections dropped below 3 million per day by the end of October, 2021, for the first time in 18 months. Between the start of the pandemic and Nov 14, 2021, there were an estimated 3·80 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·44-4·08) SARS-CoV-2 infections and reinfections globally (table, figure 2B). Nearly 1·5 billion of these infections occurred in south Asia (1·34 billion [1·20-1·49]), the most infections of all seven super-regions, whereas the highest infection rate was estimated in sub-Saharan Africa (79·3 per

estimated primarily in countries with older population structures, such as Japan. The lowest IDR, IHR, and IFR were all detected in sub-Saharan Africa, where only the southern region exceeded 0·5% for any ratio (table).
During the first 20 months of the pandemic, Reffective varied widely across locations and time, from lower than 0·1 to higher than 2·0. Only 39% of location-weeks for which total immunity was under 10% had Reffective lower than 1. Between 10% and 20% total immunity, this proportion increased to 56%, and between 20% and 30% total immunity, we observed an additional increase to 65% of location-weeks with an Reffective lower than 1 (figure 4). However, over the range of 30-60% total immunity, the percentage of observations with Reffective lower than 1 decreased back to 55%. This absence of a clear relationship highlights the many other factors such as seasonality, physical distancing mandates, mask use, and new variant spread that have influenced Reffective over time. From 60% to 70% total immunity, we observed 60% of observations with Reffective lower than 1, and above 70% total immunity, 72% of location-weeks had an Reffective lower than 1. Although these data suggest transmission to be somewhat lower at the highest levels of total immunity observed thus far, even with total immunity at 80%, we saw no indication of an abrupt drop in R . effective
Discussion
In this study, we estimated that global daily SARS-CoV-2 infections fluctuated between 3 million and 17 million new cases per day from April, 2020, to October, 2021. In total, we estimated that between the start of the pandemic and Nov 14, 2021, there were 3·80 billion (95% UI 3·44-4·08) total SARS-CoV-2 infections and reinfections combined and that 3·39 billion (3·08-3·63) individuals had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 one or more times. The proportion of the population that had been infected at least once ranged from under 1% to over 80% across countries and territories. The highest cumulative infection rates were estimated in sub-Saharan Africa; central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia; and south Asia. Translating daily infections into Reffective showed no clear herd immunity threshold.
Cumulative infection rates through Nov 14, 2021, varied greatly across countries and territories and between subnational units within countries. This variation can be explained by a combination of factors including policies enacted by governments to encourage mask use and reduce social interaction,48-50 presence of escape variants, testing and contact tracing capacity,51,52 previous exposure to other coronaviruses,53 baseline patterns of social interaction, and more. For instance, greatly different levels of cumulative infection were found in some neighbouri­ng countries with similar patterns of non-COVID-19 disease burden, such as Norway and Sweden.43 In these two countries, testing and contact tracing strategies, government restrictions,

and mobility patterns varied substantially,54 contributing to substantially different SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. Other countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, have shown how early and effective lockdowns, combined with geographical isolation and travel restrictions, have kept transmission low throughout the study period.18,55,56 Excess mortality and seroprevalence data available suggest that some of the most severe COVID-19 epidemics occurred in eastern Europe and central Asia. This might be related to comparatively less public intervention, such as mask mandates or stay-at-home orders.57,58 But, although it might be tempting to ascribe all variations in cumulative infections to effective public health action in different countries, the April-September, 2021, surges in many southeast Asian countries where, up to the end of March, public health responses to the pandemic had been swift and believed to be effective,59-61 suggest that other factors might also be contributing to these patterns.57,58
The empirical measurements of the IDR suggest that it was low early in the pandemic, when testing was scarce, and increased as testing capacity expanded. On average, the IDR increased steadily, especially over the course of the first year of the pandemic, but with marked variation across countries. This variation highlights how analyses based on the assumption that SARS-CoV-2 IDR is constant across location and time7 could be very misleading. Although we expect that, in general, IDR increased as testing capacity increased, national guidance on who should be tested, and changes in that guidance over the course of the pandemic, might also affect the IDR. For example, on May 1, 2021, the CDC issued guidance not to test vaccinated individuals who had been exposed to COVID-19 but did not have symptoms.62 Likewise, the advent of workplace and school testing programmes in the later months of 2021 might also shift the IDR up in some countries. Great care needs to be taken when interpreting trends based only on reported cases in the later phases of the pandemic. In many settings, hospitalisations--which tend to be a robust measure of more severe disease--are likely to be more informative than confirmed infections.
Our analysis suggests that the cumulative IFR across countries and territories ranged from 0·1% to 2·0% as of Nov 14, 2021. Age standardisation has been shown to explain a considerable portion of this variation,40 but substantial differences remain in the available data. Some of this variation appears to be due to the prevalence of certain comorbidites,63 and some could be residual errors in the estimation of excess mortality or seroprevalence in the available data. Nevertheless, it might turn out that other factors, such as previous exposure to other coronaviruses, help explain the considerable variation in the age-standardised IFR that is observed in the data. Such variation in the IFR should caution against studies that assume the IFR (either all-age or age-standardised) is constant across locations and over time. The temporal

analysis of the IFR supports the clinical observation that the IFR was initially much higher in March and April, 2020, and subsequently declined as clinical practice improved, particularly in approaches to oxygenation and the use of corticosteroids.64-67 Trials of some oral antivirals have shown substantial effectiveness in preventing severe disease and death, suggesting that the IFR might decline further in the coming months if these and other antivirals become widely available and if diagnostic capacity is able to support early treatment.68,69
We did not find a clear relationship between Reffective and total immunity up to 60%. Over 60%, Reffective was more often under 1·0 than over 1·0. Despite this finding, we observed no obvious herd immunity threshold in the data. The generally weak relationship between Reffective and the total immunity highlights the powerful role of other factors driving infection, including physical distancing mandates, seasonality, mask use, and the emergence of new variants over the study period (especially the delta variant) in mediating this relationship. Although figure 4 does not show us the prospects for reaching herd immunity in each location for any given season or variant, the overall relationship points to the very high degree of combined natural and vaccine-derived immunity that might be needed to block community transmission (especially in the winter months).
This empirical analysis has several important limitations. First, some seroprevalence surveys (such as the CDC monitoring of laboratory data) might be biased, but the direction of the bias is difficult to ascertain. Additionally, in reporting serosurveys, various corrections can be applied to produce estimates, including the use of sampling weights, correcting for manufacturing sensitivity and specificity, or, in some instances, full correction for waning detectability. Where possible, we attempted to standardise for this by extracting data that were adjusted for sampling frame and manufacturing sensitivity, but not more complex corrections. If this was not possible, we used the raw numerator and denominator as reported. In some instances, no metadata were provided to describe whether any correction had been applied. In all instances, these values were treated as equivalent. Second, we have assumed that one of the key covariates for the IDR is demonstrated testing capacity. By construction, this variable cannot decline as it is the maximum value of previously observed daily testing rates. In some countries, changes in guidance on who gets tested could lead to declines in effective testing and the IDR, and we may have missed these changes. The CDC guidance in spring, 2021, not to test vaccinated individuals who were asymptomatic or mildly symptom­ atic is an example of such a policy. Third, vaccination increases the proportion of the population who test positive on antispike antibody tests. We note in some locations, particularly in the UK, attempts to account for vaccination rates resulted in decreasing estimates of seroprevalence over time, suggesting that assumptions about the probability of vaccinated individuals being identified in serological

surveys in those locations are incompatible with the data collected; in these instances, we excluded the seroprevalence data from the analysis. Fourth, matched seroprevalence surveys with reported cumulative cases, hospitalisations, and deaths provide an interval measure of the IDR, IHR, and IFR from the beginning of the pandemic to the period of the survey. We used these interval measures to derive relationships for the daily IDR, IHR, and IFR. This approach decreases our ability to identify drivers of shorterterm fluctuations in these key rates. Fifth, the availability of hospital admissions data in low-income and middleincome settings was generally low, minimising its effect on the estimation process in many countries. Sixth, we used estimates of total COVID-19 mortality based on the measurement or estimation of excess mortality multiplied by a statistical estimate of the proportion of excess mortality directly attributable to infection with SARS-CoV-2. This statistical estimation was based on removing the effect of a low IDR and reduced mobility that might be a proxy for deferred care and other health effects of isolation. This estimate of the proportion of excess mortality that is total COVID-19 has wide UIs. Eventually, better data will emerge on causes of death during the pandemic that will hopefully refine the estimate of total COVID-19 deaths. The wide uncertainty in the ratio of total COVID-19 to reported COVID-19 is reflected in the uncertainty analysis in this study. Seventh, our model permitted a maximum of two infections per individual--in the case where a person gets an ancestral or alpha variant infection, they might also be infected with a beta, gamma, or delta variant. There is evidence of waning naturally derived immunity, suggesting that an individual might become more broadly susceptible to reinfection sometime after exposure.70
This empirical analysis of past COVID-19 infections ends at the point where the omicron (B.1.1.529) wave was first detected in Gauteng province in South Africa. Omicron is much more transmissible than previous variants and has shown immune escape.71 Since Nov 14, 2021, the omicron wave has taken off in all countries and territories. Because of much lower severity of disease, the IDR is likely to have dropped considerably during the omicron wave. Models suggest that more than 50% of the world might have been infected with omicron already--however, a detailed analysis will have to await new seroprevalence data emerging in the coming months. Cumulative infections for COVID-19 through to March, 2022, might be nearly double what occurred through Nov 14, 2021.
Conclusion COVID-19 has had a staggering impact on the world, with 3·39 billion (95% UI 3·08-3·63) people infected with SARS-CoV-2 at least once as of Nov 14, 2021. These findings highlight the potential for COVID-19 to have a continued and profound impact on the world's population.

Summary
Background Regular repeat surveillance testing is a strategy to identify asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections in high-risk work settings to prevent onward community transmission. Saliva sampling is less invasive compared to nasal/oropharyngeal sampling, thus making it suitable for regular testing. In this multi-centre evaluation, we aimed to validate RT-PCR using salivary swab testing of SARS-CoV-2 for large-scale surveillance testing and assess implementation amongst staff working in the hotel quarantine system in Victoria, Australia.
Methods A multi-centre laboratory evaluation study was conducted to systematically validate the in vitro and clinical performance of salivary swab RT-PCR for implementation of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing. Analytical sensitivity for multiple RT-PCR platforms was assessed using a dilution series of known SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, and assay specificity was examined using a panel of viral pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we tested capacity for large-scale saliva testing using a four-sample pooling approach, where positive pools were subsequently decoupled and retested. Regular, frequent self-collected saliva swab RT-PCR testing was implemented for staff across fourteen quarantine hotels. Samples were tested at three diagnostic laboratories validated in this study, and results were provided back to staff in real-time.

The Lancet Regional Health - Western Pacific 2022;26: 100533 Published online 8 July 2022 https://doi.org/10.1016/j. lanwpc.2022.100533

Findings The agreement of self-collected saliva swabs for RT-PCR was 84.5% (95% CI 68.6 to 93.8) compared to RTPCR using nasal/oropharyngeal swab samples collected by a healthcare practitioner, when saliva samples were collected within seven days of symptom onset. Between 7th December 2020 and 17th December 2021, almost 500,000 RT-PCR tests were performed on saliva swabs self-collected by 102 staff working in quarantine hotels in Melbourne. Of these, 20 positive saliva swabs were produced by 13 staff (0.004%). The majority of staff that tested positive occurred during periods of community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.

Interpretation Salivary RT-PCR had an acceptable level of agreement compared to standard nasal/oropharyngeal swab RT-PCR within early symptom onset. The scalability, tolerability and ease of self-collection highlights utility

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We conducted a literature search of peer-reviewed articles published between January 2020 and August 2021 focusing on the utility of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 RTPCR testing for large-scale surveillance. Most studies focused on the usefulness of saliva as an alternative specimen to nasal/oropharyngeal swabbing for patient testing in primary healthcare, mainly in high prevalence settings. To date, there are limited data available on the large-scale utilisation of saliva RT-PCR for routine surveillance testing in high-risk settings, such as staff working in quarantine facilities, particularly during lowprevalence community transmission.
Added value of this study
Here, we provide an overview of salivary swab RT-PCR performance against combined nasal/oropharyngeal swab RT-PCR testing and demonstrate validation of this method across multiple laboratories. In addition, we describe the implementation of a pooled testing method for mass surveillance testing of staff working in managed quarantine facilities. To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the implementation of mass salivary RT-PCR surveillance in Australia.
Implications of all the available evidence
In the context of new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging, there may be an ongoing need for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing of high-risk frontline staff (e.g., staff working at border interfaces; healthcare workers). Our data demonstrate the feasibility of widespread pooled salivary swab RT-PCR surveillance and applicability of this approach across a range of laboratory testing platforms.
Introduction
For centuries, quarantine, case isolation and border controls have been used as strategies to contain and mitigate the spread of infectious diseases.1 Most recently, these strategies have been employed globally to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19

pandemic. For countries such as Australia and New Zealand, these measures helped to maintain a comparatively low prevalence of COVID-19 compared to countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom.2 Between 20th of March 2020 and 1st of November 2021, the Australian international border was only open to travellers with a government-approved exemption, and all returning travellers were required to complete at least 14 days of quarantine in a hotel or another supervised facility.
In Australia, the first wave of COVID-19 was characterised by multiple incursions of SARS-CoV-2 from returning travellers with limited onward transmission.3 Conversely, until widespread community transmission of the Delta and Omicron variants in late 2021 and early 2022, outbreaks of COVID-19 were largely attributed to transmission from residents within quarantine to hotel staff or fellow residents. Most notably, infection of hotel quarantine staff in the state of Victoria, Australia in mid-2020 led to over 10,000 COVID-19 infections in a large second wave in Victoria.4 Following this outbreak, major changes were made to the hotel quarantine system; these included limiting staff employed in the hotel quarantine system from working across other settings, and improved infection control practices.5 In addition, systematic surveillance testing of staff working in the hotel quarantine system was proposed as a means of early detection of possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from hotel quarantine residents to staff.6
Saliva has been used as an alternative specimen for diagnostic and screening purposes in the COVID-19 pandemic.7 Compared to nasopharyngeal sampling, saliva collection is less invasive, and a meta-analysis of studies assessing the use of saliva suggested a similar agreement to nasopharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2, although with heterogeneity across studies regarding the populations sampled and the method of saliva collection.8 Previous work in our setting has demonstrated the feasibility of using drooled neat saliva as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs.9 However, neat saliva specimens can be complex to handle in the laboratory, with challenges relating to sample volume and viscosity.7 Saliva sampling using standardised collection devices, although impacted by sample dilution, may help reduce variability between samples; in

particular, sampling of oral saliva using a flocked swab (`saliva swabs') offers a simple and consistent way of self-collection of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and enables integration into standard RT-PCR laboratory workflows. Further, pooling of saliva samples has been demonstrated as a feasible and scalable way of testing large numbers of self-collected saliva samples.10-12
Here, we describe the development and validation of salivary RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 using self-collected saliva swabs from a widespread implementation study amongst staff working in the hotel quarantine system in Victoria, Australia during a period of increasing COVID-19 prevalence in the community. Further, to facilitate large-scale testing we analysed the efficiency of a sample pooling strategy for salivary RT-PCR testing.
Methods
Setting and study population We performed a retrospective observational study assessing the implementation of salivary RT-PCR testing in hotel quarantine workers in the Victorian capital city of Melbourne (population 4.97 million), Australia. Between March 2020 and November 2021, returning international travellers to Victoria were required to undertake fourteen days of supervised quarantine in designated quarantine hotels. Following the second wave of COVID-19, in Victoria in mid-2020 the hotel quarantine system was managed by COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria (CQV), an agency responsible for overseeing the quarantine programme. As part of this programme, there was a dedicated workforce and daily testing of on-site staff on each day they attended work, with additional voluntary paid testing through community sites on days not attending work. On-site testing was a mix of saliva swabs and combined nasal/oropharyngeal swabs, with the majority of samples being saliva swabs, but at least one sample per week being a nasal/ oropharyngeal swab. There was also voluntary regular testing of staff family members. International arrivals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were transferred to a dedicated quarantine hotel ("health hotel") managed by Alfred Health, a public healthcare service in Melbourne. To assess the performance of saliva swab RTPCR for surveillance testing in this programme, we conducted a multi-centre in vitro and clinical validation study, led by the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) at the Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (Melbourne, Australia). VIDRL is the public health virology laboratory for the state of Victoria.
Saliva swab validation and microbiological testing To assess the analytical sensitivity of saliva swab testing, a panel of 36 simulated positive samples (Supplementary

Table 1) was assembled from de-identified healthy donor saliva spiked with gamma-irradiated (50Gy) SARS-CoV-2 (VIC/01), obtained from a previous study.13 Stock irradiated virus was quantified by digital droplet RT-PCR (ddRT-PCR) (Supplementary Methods) and adjusted from 1 £ 109 RNA copies/mL to a working concentration of 1 £ 106 RNA copies/mL in saliva matrix (25% donor saliva in saline). Nine four-fold serial dilutions from 3.9 £ 103 RNA copies/mL to 0.06 RNA copies/mL were prepared and each dilution was dispensed in quadruplicate 1mL aliquots into 2mL tubes (SSIbio, USA). The end point limit of detection (LoD) was defined as the last dilution for which all four replicates returned a positive result for both Target 1 (SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 gene) and Target 2 (SARS Beta-coronavirus E gene) using the cobasÒ SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Diagnostics) (Supplementary Methods).
Cross-reactivity was examined against a panel of nonSARS-CoV-2 viruses, obtained from stored isolates in VIDRL (Supplementary Table 2). Duplicate 1mL samples were prepared from eight viral isolates harvested from various cell lines (Supplementary Table 2) and spiked into saliva matrix at a 1:20 dilution.
To test for possible inhibitory effects of using different transport media for saliva swab collection on RTPCR testing, duplicate saliva matrix samples were prepared 1:4 in 0.9% w/v saline; Viral Transport Media (VTM; Life Technologies); Universal Transport Media (UTM, Copan Italy) and liquid Amies (Copan Italy) (Supplementary Table 3). For each saliva/media matrix, irradiated SARS-CoV-2 (VIC/01) was spiked to a final viral load of 1 £ 106, 1 £ 105 and 2.5 £ 104 RNA copies/ mL, quantified by ddRT-PCR. Saliva matrices were also tested without SARS-CoV-2 virus as negative controls (Supplementary Table 3).
Clinical sensitivity was assessed by parallel testing on matched nasal/oropharyngeal swabs and saliva swabs (Copan flocked Eswab) obtained from individuals with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2, collected at a range of time intervals post-symptom onset and grouped as >7 days post-symptom onset and 7 days post-symptom onset (Table 1). Nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were collected in 1mL of liquid Amies (Copan Eswab, 480 CE Interpath Services) as per the Australian Public Health Laboratory Network (PHLN) guidelines14 and tested using the cobasÒ SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Diagnostics). Saliva swab samples were self-collected using an instructional sheet and short video. Briefly, a sterile flocked swab was inserted into the mouth for 30 seconds with the mouth closed. The swab was removed and collected into a tube containing 1mL of liquid Amies (480 CE Interpath Services) and tested using the same assay.
Pooling and decoupling algorithm for large-scale testing To enable large-scale RT-PCR testing, we established a sample pooling and decoupling algorithm. Batched

samples were prepared as four-sample pools (Figure 1) equivalent to a 1:4 dilution based on our previous experience with saliva pooling.15 A panel of twenty 1mL pooled samples (Supplementary Table 4) was assembled, each consisting of 250mL of blank VTM combined from 4 individual samples (i.e. pool 1 consisted of samples 1-4, pool 2; samples 5-8 etc.). Four of these pools were prepared as simulated infectious samples using VTM spiked with SARS-CoV-2 (VIC/01) to different concentrations (1 £ 103, 4 £ 103, 2.5 £ 102 and 1.25 £ 102 RNA copies/mL). Pooled panels were tested using the cobasÒ SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Diagnostics) by staff blinded to sample content. Positive pools were subsequently retested to identify individual positive specimens.
Validation of salivary swab testing across diagnostic laboratories To facilitate implementation of salivary swab RT-PCR testing across other laboratories, we conducted a validation exercise assessing RT-PCR platforms in two community and five public hospital laboratories in Melbourne. Sample panels were prepared to assess the analytical sensitivity and specificity of different RT-PCR assays and to challenge each laboratories capacity to pool, decouple and retest. Briefly, analytical sensitivity and specificity panels were assembled in de-identified healthy donor saliva, diluted 1:4 with 0.9% w/v saline and spiked with 1 £ 106 RNA copies/mL of gamma-irradiated (50Gy) SARS-CoV-2 (VIC/01) and prepared as 1mL quadruplicate serial dilutions from 3.9 £ 103 RNA copies/mL to 0.06 RNA copies/mL as shown in Supplementary Table 1. The end point LoD was defined as the last dilution where all assay targets were detected in all four replicates. Specificity of each platform was evaluated using a panel of eight duplicate samples of nonSARS-CoV-2 virus isolates (described above) diluted 1:20 in VTM. To test for possible inhibitory effects of using different transport media for saliva swab analysis, duplicates samples of transport media (0.9% w/v saline, VTM, UTM and Liquid Amies) were spiked with irradiated SARS-CoV-2 to final concentrations of 1 £ 106, 1 £ 105 and 2.5 £ 104 RNA copies/mL and tested by each workflow. De-identified healthy donor saliva samples diluted 1:4 in each transport media were also included as negative controls.
To evaluate pooling for batch testing at multiple laboratories, twenty 1mL four-sample pools were prepared by combining 250mL of blank VTM from each sample, as described above (Figure 1). Four of these pools were prepared as simulated infectious samples using VTM spiked with SARS-CoV-2 (VIC/01) to 1 £ 103, 4 £ 103, 2.5 £ 102 and 1.25 £ 102 RNA copies/mL. Each laboratory performed the sample pooling and retesting and were evaluated on the correct reporting of identified positive samples. Panels were distributed to each

Figure 1. Four-sample pooling for batch testing algorithm. A total of 250mL of each sample was combined into a single pool and tested by RT-PCR. Four positive pools (blue) were prepared from 20 samples consisting of 15 negative donor saliva samples and 5 samples spiked with infectious samples (purple) and tested blind; one pool contained 2 infectious samples and three contained only a single infectious sample. Subsequent re-testing was performed on positive pools to identify the individual samples.

laboratory and tested by staff blinded to the sample contents using the testing platform in their specific laboratory (Supplementary Table 5). Results from testing were provided back to VIDRL for collation, and only laboratories who provided cycle threshold (Ct) values were included for analysis in each exercise.
Implementation of testing programme Implementation of a salivary surveillance testing programme for staff working in the hotel quarantine system commenced on the 7th December 2020 in Melbourne. In total, fourteen hotels were utilised, of which twelve hotels housed returning international and interstate travellers, along with local Victorian residents requiring hotel quarantine facilities (e.g. unable to selfisolate at home), and two hotels accommodated individuals known to be SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive (Supplementary Figure 1). Saliva swab implementation was supported by staff training in saliva swab self-collection using an instructional sheet and a short training video, similar to methods described above. In some instances, this was supervised self-collection. In addition to clinical risk assessment for COVID-19 (daily temperature checks and daily attestations regarding COVID-19 symptoms and potential exposure), weekly nasal/oropharyngeal RT-PCR testing plus salivary swab PCR testing on all other days of onsite work was implemented. Salivary swab testing was performed on site, on days

employees were at work. From February 2021, this was supplemented with offsite voluntary paid PCR testing in the workplace or through community testing sites, that did not offer salivary sampling. Staff with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or identified in a potential infection control breach in a hotel, were not allowed on site and PCR testing was performed with a nasal/oropharyngeal swab. Employees included staff working as floor monitors, drivers, stewards, on-site cleaners and caterers, specimen collection staff, healthcare workers and other authorised staff. Samples were couriered to three diagnostic laboratories undertaking high-throughput salivary swab RT-PCR testing, and results were provided back to individuals (via text message, usually within 12 hours, as these tests were prioritised in the testing system) and to the Victorian Department of Health via electronic laboratory notification. Positive results were called through to the staff member. Between December 2020 and October 2021 an algorithm was developed to plan for the event of a positive saliva swab test; in that event, an additional sample for nasal/oropharyngeal swab testing would be collected from the staff member and repeat RT-PCR testing expedited at the local laboratory. The purpose of this algorithm was to provide rapid confirmatory RT-PCR results to enable timely clinical and public health action. From October 2021, a positive saliva sample was treated as a true result.

Statistical analysis Statistical analysis and data visualisation was performed using GraphPad Prism, version 9.0 (San Diego, CA, USA). Positive and negative performance agreements (PPA and NPA) as well as sensitivity and specificity were calculated by comparing the results of the saliva swab RT-PCR with nasal/oropharyngeal swab RT-PCR testing. Where appropriate, results were reported with 95% confidence intervals. Non-parametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs analysis of mean Ct values between saliva and nasal/oropharyngeal samples was performed to determine significance at a p-value 0.05 (mean § SD) and Spearman's linear correlations were performed to identify trend between sample types.

Results
Salivary swab RT-PCR is a sensitive assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 Analytical sensitivity for the cobasÒ SARS-CoV-2 assay against a 4-fold dilution series of simulated infectious saliva samples was 62.5 RNA copies/mL (Supplementary Table 1). No cross-reactivity was observed to nonSARS-CoV-2 viruses, and salivary RT-PCR performance was not significantly different between media types at 1 £ 106, 1 £ 105 and 2.5 £ 104 RNA copies/mL (Supplementary Tables 2 & 3). All external laboratories detected spiked saliva swab specimens at 62 RNA copies/mL (Supplementary Table 5) and reported no cross-reactivity to any of the distractor viruses. Ct values for spiked saliva diluted in different transport media types were similar (Supplementary Figure 2) and no inhibition was observed.
Qualitative evaluation and validation of a sample pooling algorithm To increase saliva swab RT-PCR testing throughput capacity, we evaluated an algorithm to pool samples for batch testing (Figure 1). From the 20 pooled samples tested, the four simulated infectious pools were correctly identified by the cobasÒ SARS-CoV-2 assay (Supplementary Table 4). Subsequent re-testing of the individual samples from each positive pool correctly identified the five individual SARS-CoV-2 spiked

samples. Similarly, blind evaluation and validation of this testing algorithm by external laboratories resulted in correct identification of infectious pools and subsequent retesting of the individual positive samples (Supplementary Table 4). No false positives or false negatives were observed.
Clinical salivary swab RT-PCR testing In total, 62 saliva swab specimens were obtained from individuals known to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 from nasal/oropharyngeal swabs, 53 of which had associated symptom onset data (Table 1). Of the 53 samples with symptom onset data, 45 were positive using the saliva swab giving a sensitivity of 59.2% (95% CI 45.2 to 71.8) to nasal/oropharyngeal swabs (excluding single target positives, which were called `indeterminate'). Of the 41 samples collected within seven days of symptom onset, 28 were positive, whereby the sensitivity increased to 84.5% (95% CI 68.6 to 93.8). A single saliva swab returned a positive result in the absence of a positive nasal/OP test. The Ct values for this sample were 34.9 (Target 1) and 36.2 (Target 2). For individuals with symptom onset greater than seven days, Target 1 Ct values ranged from 16.6 to 34 for nasal/oropharyngeal swabs, and 26.6 to 35.2 for saliva swabs. The Ct values on both targets of the cobasÒ SARS-CoV-2 assay were significantly lower for nasal/oropharyngeal samples than for saliva swab samples (p-value <0.001) (Supplementary Figure 3).
Saliva swab RT-PCR testing in hotel quarantine workers From the beginning of the testing programme in Hotel Quarantine staff, from December 2020 to December 2021, 102 staff members tested positive for COVID-19. Six of these were in February 2021, while the remaining 96 were from September to December 2021, when community rates markedly increased, and these later infections were deemed to be community-acquired. Of the 102 staff, 66 (64.7%) were detected using nasal/oropharyngeal PCR, 13 (12.7%) were detected using salivary swab PCR, and the swab type for the remainder was not recorded. Of note, the bias for detection of cases using nasal/oropharyngeal PCR was likely due to the preference for this swab type in symptomatic staff members or following any infection control breach. Between 7th December 2020 and 17th December 2021, a total of 494,770 saliva swabs were tested, with repeat nasal/oropharyngeal tests of staff who returned a positive saliva sample sent to local laboratories for confirmation. The 13 staff (above) produced a total of 20 positive saliva swabs (0.004%). For these individuals the protocol required retesting by nasal/oropharyngeal swab RTPCR, and, subsequently, 18 were deemed negative. Five of the 18 saliva samples were tested at VIDRL and

returned a high Ct Target 1 (only) positive, and 13 were tested at the Alfred and returned a high Ct Target 2 positive (only) result. For the remaining two positive saliva results (one, Target 1 and Target 2 positive, the other, just Target 2 positive), neither had a follow up confirmatory nasal/oropharyngeal swab available to test.
Discussion
Here, we describe the development and implementation of large-scale salivary RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Melbourne, Australia. Following the second wave of COVID-19 in Melbourne, the hotel quarantine worker testing programme was implemented in December 2020 to coincide with the return of international travel into Melbourne.6 Specifically, the purpose of the testing programme was to prevent incursions of SARS-CoV-2 from returning travellers, via hotel quarantine staff, into the Australian community. In order for widespread surveillance testing to be successful, both the sampling and laboratory testing aspects needed to be scalable, tolerable and accessible. To address this requirement, we developed and implemented a self-collected salivary swab RT-PCR testing method for use across a range of testing platforms and in multiple laboratories.
In our study, the clinical sensitivity of saliva swab testing compared to nasal/oropharyngeal swabs on individuals within seven days of symptom onset was 84.5% (95% CI 68.6 to 93.8), in keeping with other published work.16,17 Although the sensitivity of saliva testing using swab-based collection is less than that of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs, likely due to factors such as sample dilution and differential viral tropism, previous studies have suggested that increasing the frequency of testing using less sensitive testing approaches may offset the reduction in sensitivity compared to nasal/oropharyngeal RTPCR testing.18,19 As such, high-frequency testing was useful in low disease prevalence settings.19,20 Salivary swab RT-PCR is ideally suited to frequent sampling as it is non-invasive and is amenable to self-collection. Further, because most laboratory workflows using commercial testing platforms are adapted for handling swabs, swab-based saliva testing is suitable for scaling up across diagnostic laboratories, compared to handling neat saliva specimens. Moreover, we found that using pools of four saliva swab samples demonstrated minimal loss of sensitivity and was an effective strategy to increase testing capacity. Other recent studies have used larger pool sizes for salivary RT-PCR surveillance; for example, Mendoza et al. utilised pools of up to 24 neat saliva samples for surveillance testing in schools in New York, allowing testing of over 250,000 saliva specimens over a 20-week period.11 Similarly, Joachim et al. used pooled salivary swab samples from school children in Germany, employing one or two pooled testing groups per class.21 However, one of the key aims of testing hotel quarantine staff is early identification of

possible incursions from returning travellers into the community; as such, in our setting, we chose to use pool sizes of four to allow a balance between scale and sensitivity.
Since the commencement of the hotel quarantine saliva RT-PCR surveillance programme, approximately 500,000 saliva swabs have been tested in Victoria, with salivary RT-PCR testing validated and deployed at multiple laboratories. Further, salivary swab surveillance testing has subsequently been utilised in other settings in Australia. For example, salivary swab testing was used in the management of the Australian Open international tennis tournament in January 2021 and was extended to surveillance testing of healthcare workers who provide direct care for patients with COVID-19.22 In the healthcare setting, early detection of spread from patients to healthcare workers may prevent onward transmission in both the hospital and community.23,24
Our study has several limitations. We were unable to collect information on potential false positive and false negative results from all laboratories. However, as part of risk management for the salivary RT-PCR programme, we developed an algorithm to facilitate rapid confirmatory RT-PCR testing by repeat nasal/oropharyngeal swab testing. This algorithm helped to ensure that all positive results obtained using salivary swab testing were confirmed using nasal/oropharyngeal swab RT-PCR testing, thus helping mitigate the risk of false positives, and allowing rapid confirmation of true positive results. In addition, we did not conduct a specific cost-benefit analysis of the salivary swab RT-PCR testing, although work is ongoing in our setting to assess the overall cost-effectiveness of the programme.
For most of 2020 and 2021, Australia relied heavily on strict public health measures (including localised lockdowns), and closure of the international border to maintain comparatively low morbidity and mortality rates due to COVID-19.2 Until the emergence and spread of the Delta, and subsequently Omicron variant in Victoria and New South Wales (the country's most populous states), Australia had several periods of successful elimination in 2020 and 2021.4,5 However, to meet the testing demand required for re-opening, scalable and accessible testing approaches became necessary to complement conventional nasal/oropharyngeal RT-PCR, including accessible rapid antigen testing and pooled salivary RT-PCR testing.
Conclusion
In this study, we describe the use of mass salivary swab RT-PCR testing in hotel quarantine staff. Along with stringent infection control practices, our data embedded salivary swab testing as an important component of border security measures to help reduce incursions of COVID-19 into Australia. We demonstrate that saliva swab samples can be used at scale for SARS-CoV-2

Abstract
Background: There are uncertainties about mitigating strategies for swimming-related activities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an opportunity to learn from the experience of previous re-openings to better plan the future one. Our objectives are to systematically review the evidence on (1) the association between engaging in swimming-related activities and COVID-19 transmission; and (2) the effects of strategies for preventing COVID-19 transmission during swimming-related activities.
Methods: We conducted a rapid systematic review. We searched in the L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) plat form for COVID-19. The searches covered the period from the inception date of each database until April 19, 2021. We included non-randomized studies for the review on association of COVID-19 transmission and swimming-related activities. We included guidance documents reporting on the strategies for prevention of COVID-19 transmission during swimming-related activities. We also included studies on the efficacy and safety of the strategies. Teams of two reviewers independently assessed article eligibility. For the guidance documents, a single reviewer assessed the eli gibility and a second reviewer verified the judgement. Teams of two reviewers extracted data independently. We sum marized the findings of included studies narratively. We synthesized information from guidance documents according to the identified topics and subtopics, and presented them in tabular and narrative formats.
Results: We identified three studies providing very low certainty evidence for the association between engaging in swimming-related activities and COVID-19 transmission. The analysis of 50 eligible guidance documents identified 11 topics: ensuring social distancing, ensuring personal hygiene, using personal protective equipment, eating and drinking, maintaining the pool, managing frequently touched surfaces, ventilation of indoor spaces, screening and management of sickness, delivering first aid, raising awareness, and vaccination. One study assessing the efficacy of strategies to prevent COVID-19 transmission did not find an association between compliance with precautionary restrictions and COVID-19 transmission.
Conclusions: There are major gaps in the research evidence of relevance to swimming-related activities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the synthesis of the identified strategies from guidance documents can inform public health management strategies for swimming-related activities, particularly in future re-opening plans.

Background In January 2020, a new coronavirus was identified in China and has since spread worldwide, causing an outbreak. This novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of Wuhan in China. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the acute respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 [1]. In March 2020, the WHO declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. It has since triggered a global lockdown and resulted in an unprecedented recession. As of April 2021, it has already infected more than 150 million people and accounted for more than 3 million deaths worldwide [2].
In response to the growing pandemic, governments across the world used partial or full lockdowns on their populations as part of the public health efforts to flatten the epidemiologic curve and avoid a surge of cases that would overwhelm their healthcare systems [3, 4]. As part of those lockdowns, airports and educational establishments are closed, businesses, both public and private, are forced to adjust their operations, and most employees are asked to work from home [5].
Following each lockdown, governments implement reopening plans with a major aim of safely emerging from economic recessions [6]. Those plans include policies and guidance for re-opening public places for outdoor activities, including swimming-related activities. It would be important to learn from the experience of those re-openings, to better plan the future re-opening, e.g., in terms of enhancing mitigating strategies for different activities.
Swimming-related activities are undeniably important for the physical and mental well-being of millions of individuals forced into confinement and isolation for prolonged periods. However, swimming in a pool or a lake, and sunbathing on the beach or shore, imply close proximity between individuals and high frequency of touching common surfaces. These factors would increase the risk of virus transmission. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 is reported to spread through droplet and potentially airborne transmission [7]. Water-borne transmission is still not certain. A well-publicized event was a Fourth of July celebration in a Michigan lake, where individuals contracted COVID-19 [8].
The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence on (1) the association between engaging in swimming-related activities and COVID-19 transmission; and (2) the effects of strategies for preventing COVID-19 transmission during swimming-related activities.

Methods We conducted a rapid systematic review to identify, select, abstract, assess, and synthesize the available evidence addressing our questions of interest. We report this rapid systematic review following the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist. We registered the protocol in Open Science Framework (osf.io/38hrw). While we initially aimed to conduct a living systematic review (as stated in the protocol), we opted to conduct a regular (non-living) review due to feasibility issues.
Eligibility criteria For the review of association, the population of interest was the general public. The exposure of interest was engaging in any swimming-related activity, such as going to a pool, a beach, a river or a lake. The outcome of interest was COVID-19 infection. Eligible study designs consisted of non-randomized studies (including cohort studies, case control studies, case series and case reports). We did not have any language restrictions. We excluded environmental studies, mechanistic studies, modeling studies, reviews, letters to the editor, conference abstracts, commentaries and opinion pieces.
For the review of strategies, we included guidance documents reporting on the prevention of COVID-19 transmission during swimming-related activities. Eligible documents should have provided a substantial description of a strategy. We also included studies of any language on the efficacy and safety of these strategies. We excluded mechanistic studies. We excluded documents that did not address swimming-related activities (e.g., rehabilitation pools, fishing), were only regulatory (i.e., official documents stating the phases of opening), solely referred to other guidance documents, were press releases or were in the form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).
Search strategy For both, the review of association and the review of strategies, we systematically searched in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that maps PICO questions to a repository developed by Epistemonikos Foundation. This repository is continuously updated through searches in 41 sources including electronic databases, preprint servers, trial registries and other resources relevant to COVID-19. The searches covered the period from the inception date of each database until April 19, 2021. The results of the searches in the

Yaacoub et al. BMC Infect Dis (2021) 21:1112

individual sources were de-duplicated by an algorithm that compares unique identifiers (database ID, DOI, trial registry ID), and citation details (i.e., author names, journal, year of publication, volume, number, pages, article title, and article abstract). We ran a search about `swimming-related activities', using the search methods of the COVID-19 L·OVE platform [9]. Additional file 1: Appendix 1 provides the list of terms and databases used in those searches. Additionally, we screened the references of included studies and aimed to screen relevant systematic reviews.
For the review of strategies, we also searched the websites of relevant guideline-producing organizations, initially up to June 10, 2020, for relevant guidance documents. We compiled a list of these organizations starting with a list we had developed for another project on guidance documents (unpublished). Also, we searched the International Association for Sports and Leisure Facilities (IAKS) website for news on `pools and aquatic facilities' [10] to identify further organizations. In addition, we identified countries that were easing travel restrictions [11], and searched the websites of every state of the United States (U.S.). Then, we performed a general Google search as well as a Google search restricted to governmental websites (.gov). We used a combination of terms referring to COVID-19 and pools, beaches, rivers and lakes. We also screened the references of included guidance documents. We updated the list of guidance documents on April 19, 2021.
Study selection The information matching the search strategy was sent in real-time to the L·OVE platform where at least two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts yielded against the inclusion criteria. We obtained the full texts for all the studies that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria or required further analysis. Then, we judged the eligibility of these studies. We resolved any conflicts by discussion, or with the help of a third reviewer. We recorded the primary reason for exclusion at the full-text screening stage and we listed those studies with the reasons for exclusion.
For the identified guidance documents, the first reviewer assessed the eligibility and the second reviewer verified the judgement of the first reviewer. We resolved any conflicts by discussion, or with the help of a third reviewer.
Data extraction and synthesis Teams of two reviewers extracted data independently using a pilot-tested form. They resolved disagreements by consensus, or with the help of a third reviewer as needed. The data we extracted from studies of association

included study population, setting, and data on risk of COVID-19 transmission. For the review of strategies, we extracted data on the entity that produced the guidance document, date of last update, country and language, setting of the guidance (i.e., beach and/or pool), and focus (either specifically addressing swimming activities, or addressing other activities). We abstracted from each document all relevant recommendations in detail and analyzed them to identify the topics and subtopics covered. In addition, we abstracted data from studies reporting on efficacy and safety of these strategies. Abstracted data included study population, setting, types of strategies, and data on COVID-19 transmission following the implementation of strategies. We performed the risk of bias assessment using ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies and planned to use the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized studies, when applicable.
We aimed to quantitatively synthesize data on association and data on the effects of strategies. However, this was not possible, and we therefore summarized the findings of included studies narratively. We synthesized information from guidance documents according to the identified topics and subtopics and presented them in tabular and narrative formats. Where applicable, we reported the percentage of guidance documents addressing the topics or subtopics. For topics with high variability or inconsistency, we made sure to present the spectrum of recommendations given. Otherwise, we attempted to represent agreement across guidance documents where applicable. We graded the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach [12].
Results
Review of association Figure 1 presents the results of the selection process conducted in the COVID-19 L·OVE platform. After deduplication and title and abstract screening, COVID-19 L·OVE platform identified 29 potentially eligible full text studies. We excluded 26 studies for the following reasons: not about swimming (n=5), not outcome of interest (n=12), not eligible study design (n=6), duplicates (n=1), full text not found (n=2) (see Additional file 1: Appendix 2a for more details). This resulted in three eligible studies for the review of association [13-15].
Termansen et al., a preprint publication, conducted a retrospective questionnaire-based single arm cohort to describe the extent of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at indoor swimming activities in Danish swimming clubs during August-December 2020. Data were collected from an official contact person from each swimming club using an electronic-based questionnaire. Out of a total of 162 risk episodes (i.e., where a SARS-CoV-2 positive subject was participating in a swimming activity), eight

(database ID, DOI, trial registry ID), and citation details (i.e. author names, journal, year of publication, volume, number, pages, article title, and article abstract). bThree of these were guidance documents, two of which were included in the review of strategies

(4.9%) led to transmission to 23 participants. The transmission was reported to be 43.5 and 4.7 participants per 100,000 pool activity hours in competitive swimming and recreational swimming, respectively. None was reported for water polo as there was no transmission episode. The authors also noted that 23 swimmers from the same club were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a training camp. However, other clubs training in the same swimming pool in the same period did not report infected participants. The authors hypothesized that transmission could have resulted from other activities during the training camp (e.g. sleeping in dormitories, dining and socializing together) [15].
Bao et al. conducted an epidemiological study to investigate an outbreak of COVID-19 infection. The index case had frequented an entertainment site, which contained a floor for public bathing. The patient took a public bath on 2 consecutive days. A total of 12 bath-related infections were attributed directly to that patient: ten among bathers, and two among workers at the site. One of these bathers subsequently infected 19 colleagues and

family members at consecutive dinners, and one of the two workers infected 41 individuals, of which seven were bathers. Authors noted that the secondary attack rate at the pool was significantly lower than that outside the pool (i.e. colleagues and family clusters). They hypothesized that this could be due to the high temperature (between 18 and 42 °C) and humidity (60-80%) at the entertainment site, which `suppressed virus transmissibility' [13].
Luo et al. reported data for nine confirmed COVID-19 patients who frequented the same `bath center' and were hospitalized in the Jiangsu Province of China. The bath center contained a swimming pool, showers, and sauna. The authors reported that the first patient showered in the center, while the next seven patients showered, used the sauna, and swam in the pool, and the 9th case was among staff. The study concluded that transmissibility of COVID-19 "showed no signs of weakening in warm and humid conditions" (temperature was 25-41 °C and humidity was 60%) [14].

We judged the evidence supporting the conclusions of these three studies to be of very low certainty (one retrospective single arm study and two small case series with no adjustment for confounding). Review of strategies We identified in the COVID-19 L·OVE one study assessing the efficacy but not safety of strategies for preventing COVID-19 transmission during swimming-related activities (study by Termansen et al. described above). The study found no association between implementation of restrictions and risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during indoor swimming activities. Restrictions included distancing, personal hygiene, limiting use of shared equipment, limiting physical activity around the pool area, and raising chlorine content. The authors reported that this analysis had low statistical power [15]. We judged the study as having serious risk of bias and providing very low certainty evidence.
We identified a total of 73 guidance documents (71 through hand-searching and two through COVID-19 L·OVE). We excluded 23 documents for the following reasons: regulatory type (n=5), not about COVID-19 (n=2), not about swimming-related activity or brief section on swimming (n=5), press release (n=3), information in the form of FAQs (n=4), other (n=4) (Additional file 1: Appendix 2b).
We included a total of 50 guidance issued by 50 organizations and published in 76 documents (15 guidance were published in more than one document) (Additional file 1: Appendix 3). Table 1 shows the characteristics of included guidance documents.
The majority of those documents specifically addressed swimming activities (82%), were issued by governmental organizations (80%), were issued by U.S. based organizations (62%), were published in English (82%) and addressed pool (as opposed to beach) related activities (94%). The documents addressed 11 topics related to swimming activities (Table 2).
Additional file 1: Appendix 4 presents a detailed description of recommendations organized by topics and sub-topics. Figure 2 represents an infographic summarizing the recommendations by topic. We present a brief description of those recommendations in the subsequent sections for each of the 11 topics.
Ensuring social distancing
a. Managing capacity: Most documents addressed limiting the capacity of facilities (n=44, 88%). Documents defined limits using one of the following parameters: a percentage of usual capacity (n=14, 32%) (typically 50% of usual capacity with values ranging between 25 and 75%); number of persons

allowed per surface area (n=8, 18%); gathering limits set by local authorities (n=7, 16%), or a set maximum number (n=4, 9%). To ensure adherence to capacity limits, 30 documents mentioned ways to limit number of guests at a given time (n=30, 68%), such as a reservation system (n=18, 60%); and 18 documents mentioned ways to limit number of users of specific facilities at a given time (n=18, 41%), such as reducing the number available for use (n=14, 78%). b. Distancing measures: Most documents advised on distancing measures (n=49, 98%). The majority of documents recommended either 6 feet (n=31, 63%) or 2 m (n=4, 8%); while the rest recommended 1.5 m (n=5, 10%) or 1 m (n=2, 4%). In order to ensure adherence to the advised distancing measures, documents recommended the installation of physical barriers (n=24, 49%) the use of visual cues (n=30, 61%), changing the space layout (n=38, 78%), and managing traffic flow of individuals (n=20, 41%). Other measures included restricting access to specific areas (n=24, 49%), restricting specific activities (n=24, 49%), modifying the schedule to reduce patrons' and/or staff 's interactions (n=19, 39%), pool and area monitoring (n=18, 37%), and swimmingspecific distancing measures (n=14, 29%), such as limiting swimming to a single person per lane (n=4, 29%)

Ensuring personal hygiene A total of 45 documents addressed ensuring personal hygiene (n=45, 90%). Most of these documents mentioned promoting personal hygiene practices (n=35,

78%), such as handwashing (n=33, 94%), respiratory etiquette (n=17, 49%) and avoiding touching the face with unwashed hands (n=11, 31%). Other measures included facilitating personal hygiene practices (n=27, 60%) (e.g. by ensuring access to hand sanitizer dispensers and/or washing stations), ensuring adequate hygiene supplies (n=33, 73%), and practicing safe payment procedures (n=19, 42%).
Using personal protective equipment (PPE) The majority of guidance documents (n=38, 76%) mentioned the use of PPE, especially when physical distancing cannot be achieved (n=16, 42%). More specifically,

documents mentioned the wear of face coverings (masks or cloth face coverings) by patrons (n=27, 71%), as well as by staff (n=26, 68%) and lifeguards (n=7, 18%). There was a general agreement that masks should not be worn inside the water and damp areas (n=23, 61%). Other PPE options included glove use by staff (n=9, 24%) when cleaning or when handling towels.
Eating and drinking Twenty-five documents addressed eating (n=25, 50%). Five guidance documents mentioned limiting services to prepackaged food (n=5, 20%), seven mentioned discouraging sharing food among patrons or employees

(n=7, 28%), and eleven mentioned approaches to ensure social distancing in eating areas (n=11, 44%). Twelve documents tackled management procedures for drinking (n=12, 48%). Of these, six documents suggested keeping the drinking fountains functional (n=6, 50%), five documents suggested suspending or restricting their use (n=5, 42%) and four documents encouraged visitors to bring their own water/fluids (n=4, 33%).

61%) through monitoring the pool chemistry (n=8, 57%) and keeping monitoring records (n=3, 21%), alongside other measures. An additional measure of quality control is ensuring compliance with rules and regulations (n=18, 78%), whether state or local regulations (n=13, 72%), CDC considerations (n=3, 17%), WHO strategies (n=1, 6%), licensing conditions (n=1, 6%), or manufacturers' guidelines (n=1, 6%).

Maintaining the pool Out of the 33 guidance documents that reported on pool maintenance, 22 reported on the use of a disinfectant for the pool (n=22, 67%). The most reported disinfectant was chlorine (n=20, 91%), followed by bromine (n=9, 41%). Ten documents reported on measures for cleaning the pool (n=10, 30%), including proper stocking of products (n=1, 10%). As part of quality control (n=23, 70%), 14 guidance documents suggested monitoring (n=14,

Managing frequently touched surfaces The majority of documents addressed managing frequently touched surfaces (n=48, 96%). Frequently touched surfaces included: toilets, restrooms and dressing rooms (n=36, 75%); the pool and beach area, including deck and equipment (n=28, 58%); and other common areas/surfaces, including waiting rooms, door knobs, pool ladders and/or lifts (n=34, 71%). The recommended frequency of cleaning was highly variable across

Yaacoub et al. BMC Infect Dis (2021) 21:1112

Page 8 of 10

documents (n=33, 69%). Control measures to decrease the frequency of touching surfaces included the prohibition of sharing objects (n=19, 40%), restricting the use and access to facilities for which disinfection between different users is not practical (n=12, 25%), providing no-touch or foot pedal installations (n=9, 19%), and using contactless payment methods or online transactions (n=16, 33%). Four guidance documents mentioned requiring guests to provide their own towels (n=4, 8%), and seven mentioned measures for appropriate washing and drying of towels if provided (n=7, 15%).
Ventilation of indoor spaces Twenty-one documents addressed ventilation in indoor spaces (n=21, 42%). Recommendations included ensuring that ventilation systems operate properly (n=10, 48%) and increasing circulation of outdoor air by opening windows and doors or by other methods (n=16, 76%).
Screening and management of sickness A total of 45 documents reported on screening and management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases (n=45, 90%). From those, 34 documents highlighted the need for patrons or staff to stay at home in case of illness or contact with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case (n=34, 76%). For employees, the time duration after which returning to work was allowed varied substantially across documents (n=8, 18%). In addition, specific measures were highlighted in seventeen documents to protect patrons or staff that are considered high risk individuals (n=17, 38%), such as allocating access time for this group (n=4, 24%), taking extra precautions (n=3, 18%), and refraining from going to the pool (n=6, 35%).
Delivering first aid A total of 21 documents mentioned first aid and/or lifeguard-related measures (n=21, 43%). Ten mentioned measures relating to the provision of first aid (n=10, 48%), such as treating any victim as COVID-19 positive until otherwise determined (n=2, 20%), provision of appropriate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) equipment (e.g. one-way valve masks for CPR; n=6, 60%), and revising CPR protocol (n=4, 40%). Ten documents (n=10, 48%) highlighted that lifeguards were expected not to perform duties that distract them from the responsibilities of lifeguarding (including monitoring hand washing, mask wearing, and social distancing). Ten documents mentioned that lifeguards should wear PPE (n=10, 48%), and eight documents mentioned that lifeguards should limit contact and abide by social distancing (8, 38%).

Raising awareness Different documents addressed the importance of delivering awareness messages and/or regulations in swimming facilities through written (posting) and/or oral (broadcasting) approaches (n=36, 72%). Posted signs and/or broadcasts mostly covered measures on social distancing (n=26, 72%), hand hygiene (n=16, 44%), and measures taken in case of symptomatic individuals (n=21, 58%), such as not being allowed to enter. Signs were advised to be posted at multiple locations (n=18, 50%), mostly at the entrance of facilities. Signs needed to be tailored to the target audience, including being in understandable language (n=2, 6%).
Vaccination Three documents reported on vaccination-related guidance (n=3, 6%). Two documents advised that facilities apply the same preventive measures regardless of vaccination status of individuals (n=2, 67%). The third document reported that staff should consider getting an annual flu vaccination (n=1, 33%).
Discussion
Summary of findings In summary, we identified three studies providing very low certainty evidence for the association between engaging in swimming-related activities and COVID-19 transmission. We also identified 50 guidance documents on strategies to prevent COVID-19 transmission during swimming-related activities. The guidance documents addressed the following 11 topics: pool maintenance, social distancing, personal protective equipment (mostly face coverings), managing frequently touched surfaces, eating and/or drinking, first aid, personal hygiene, screening and management of sickness, raising awareness, and vaccination. We identified one study assessing the efficacy of strategies to prevent COVID-19 transmission, showing no association between compliance with precautionary restrictions and transmission. It provided very low certainty evidence. Strengths and limitations This rapid systematic review has a number of strengths. First, we used a very extensive and thorough search strategy across all languages. Through using the COVID-19 L·OVE platform, we were able to utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to search, deduplicate search results, and identify potentially eligible studies in real time (given the continuous update of the platform). A team of diverse experienced reviewers finalized the selection, data abstraction and synthesis steps. Also, we searched for guidance documents through checking the websites of all states in the U.S., of countries easing travel restrictions and of associations concerned

with sports and leisure activities. Although we conducted a rapid review, we followed standard methods of conducting systematic reviews to a large extent [16, 17]. One limitation of this study is that we did not include mechanistic or environmental studies. Another limitation is that the search for the guidance documents was not systematic. A major limitation is that the included guidance documents were not formally developed guidelines (i.e., would not meet the criteria of trustworthy guidelines, or score well on the AGREE II tool). Another limitation is that some of the guidance documents focused on a specific phase of reopening, and could have been later on modified, e.g., to address another phase of the reopening. However, our summarized strategies reflect the most recent guidance available at the time of our data retrieval.
Interpretation of findings Our findings show a major gap in the research evidence on the association between engaging in swimmingrelated activities and COVID-19 transmission, and on the efficacy and safety of strategies related to this topic. This is consistent with research on transmission through other activities including singing and playing wind instruments [18].
To a large extent, the documents were consistent particularly in relation to the broad principles of social distancing, use of PPE, personal hygiene, and cleaning surfaces. Documents also commonly highlighted measures addressing individuals considered high risk (e.g. older adults). However, there were some variability, and even some inconsistencies in how exactly to apply those principles. For example, there was some variability in how to implement `capacity control' as part of `ensuring social distancing'. Guidance documents proposed one or more of a number of ways of defining maximum capacity, e.g. as a percentage, persons per square meter of surface area, maximum fixed number of persons, or other. Areas with clear inconsistences were opening versus closing food services; keeping drinking fountains functional versus suspending their use; allowing versus banning specific activities (e.g. swimming classes), and lifeguard duties (whether or not they include enforcing social distancing).
Implications for public health practice In light of the scarce evidence on the association of COVID-19 transmission with swimming-related activities, or on the effectiveness of mitigating interventions, the synthesis of the identified strategies from guidance documents can inform public health management strategies for swimming-related activities, particularly in future re-opening plans. In addition, pool managers and operators should take into account the relevance, acceptability, feasibility, availability of resources, and prevalence

of COVID-19, upon implementing COVID-19 prevention strategies.
Implications for research There is a need for evidence on the association of COVID-19 transmission and engaging in swimmingrelated activities and on the efficacy and safety of the proposed strategies. Although we found scarce evidence for swimming-related activities, we are aware of the availability of streams of evidence from other contexts (e.g. mode of transmission in healthcare setting or community) and from other types of studies (e.g., mechanistic and modeling studies) that could be relevant to our topic. One can build on those streams of evidence to support an analytical framework addressing the different activities and exposures, mode of transmission, mitigating factors and modifying factors for COVID-19 in swimmingrelated activities.

Abstract
In this paper, we replace the standard numerical approach of estimating parameters in a mathematical model using numerical solvers for differential equations with a physics-informed neural network (PINN). This neural network requires a sequence of time instances as direct input of the network and the numbers of susceptibles, vaccinated, infected, hospitalized, and recovered individuals per time instance to learn certain parameters of the underlying model, which are used for the loss calculations.
The established model is an extended susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model in which the transitions between disease-related population groups, called compartments, and the physical laws of epidemic transmission dynamics are expressed by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The system of ODEs and its time derivative are included in the residual loss function of the PINN in addition to the data error between the current network output and the time series data of the compartment sizes. Further, we illustrate how this PINN approach can also be used for differential equation-based models such as the proposed extended SIR model, called SVIHR model.
In a validation process, we compare the performance of the PINN with results obtained with the numerical technique of non-standard finite differences (NSFD) in generating future COVID-19 scenarios based on the parameters identified by the PINN. The used training data set covers the time between the outbreak of the pandemic in Germany and the last week of the year 2021.
We obtain a two-step or hybrid approach, as the PINN is then used to generate a future COVID-19 outbreak scenario describing a possibly next pandemic wave. The week at which the prediction starts is chosen in mid-April 2022.

COVID-19-related population group sizes in Germany are also applicable to other countries for which data that can be transformed into sizes of model compartments is available.
The COVID-19 pandemic is currently one of the most discussed topics worldwide. The first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Asia in December 2019, but they were not reliably identified then. The People's Republic of China experienced a peak of about 4600 cases per day in mid-February 2020, but by March 2020, the epidemic was largely contained in China and other Asian parts of the world. Europe experienced the first wave of the pandemic in March and April 2020, with, for example, about 5840 new daily infections in Germany in late March and 13,260 new daily infections in France in mid-April 2020.
While infection numbers in Europe were generally low in the summer of 2020, peaks were observed in the United States (67,000 infections/day), Brazil (46,000 infections/day), and India (93,000 infections/day) at certain times between July and September 2020. The third wave was characterized by approximately 35,000 new daily infections in Italy in mid-November 2020, 25,000 new daily infections in Germany around Christmas, 60,000 new daily infections in the United Kingdom in early January 2021, and severe lockdowns within Europe in fall 2020 and winter 2020/2021. The summer of 2021 was characterized by a relaxation of intervention measures in Europe. However, some countries experienced catastrophic COVID-19 events, such as India, with approximately 390,000 new daily infections in early May 2021 [16].
In November 2021, the fourth wave of the pandemic spread throughout Europe despite a fully vaccinated proportion of 67.6% in Germany, 68.9% in the United Kingdom, 74.8% in Italy, 77.7% in France, and 80.6% in Portugal [23]. Nearly 40,000 new daily infections were observed in Germany on November 14th 2021, as well as in the United Kingdom. Achieving even higher vaccination rates and providing booster vaccinations for all to maintain a high level of infection protection are policy issues of concern to all countries. The dangers posed by mutant virus variants such as the delta variant (B.1.617.2), which was first discovered in India in October 2020 and is now the dominant variant infecting people in several countries such as Germany, or the omicron variant (B.1.1.529) discovered in the autumn of 2021, are also being discussed in medicine and the literature. According to the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI), the mRNA vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca are expected to have a protective effect of approximately 90% against severe infection with the alpha (B.1.1.7) variant and 75% against symptomatic infection with the delta (B.1.617.2) variant [20].
The mathematical model used in this work to describe the population dynamics of COVID-19 is an SVIHR model. It is based on a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Most mathematical models describing the spread of the disease employ classical compartments in which the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) structure is the most basic form of [2]. Mathematical modeling helps forecast the dynamics of infectious diseases. Over the past nearly two years, a variety of compartmental models have been introduced as enhanced SIR models to study various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is clear that SIR models make simplifying assumptions about the population and disease process, which may be a reason to critically question and debate them. A study by Kharazmi et al. showed that a general disadvantage of COVID-19 models was the treatment of key parameter values as being fixed over time [10]. There are alternative methods to predict the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, including fitting curves to empirically

observed data and solely data-driven non-numerical approaches. We always must keep in mind that the novelty of SARS-CoV-2 leads to many uncertainties in all modeling attempts due to biological features of transmission, viral mutations, pathogen behavior, and, of course, the unknown exact number of infections [10]. Moreover, no method can optimally predict the future, but a good model provides an approximation that is accurate enough to be useful for informing public policy [25]. The advantage of PINNs, which use physical laws governing the system in the form of equations, is the ability to be retrained as new data is collected and update the models over time with inferred parameters [10]. SIR-type models add a mathematical indication to a neural network, such that the exclusive data-drivenness is sustained with systematic knowledge of the disease transmission and behavior of the population. Depending on the number and kinds of used compartments and model parameters and their definition, an SIR-type model can be adapted to specific targets one has with respect to implementation. This can, for instance, be the estimation of future hospital occupancy, the influence of specific intervention measures, and isolation rates or the rate of asymptomatic infections. Respective transition rates can be fit into the model. The targets of the implementations and suitability of a certain model depend on the region or country used for data assimilation because of different conditions and disease spreads in distinct regions. In our approach, the country Germany is used for data collection and as the basis of model establishment, and our focus lies on infection and hospitalization numbers.
In this paper, we do not establish the simplest version of the compartment model. Instead, we develop some kind of extended model, which complements the basic SIR model by a vaccinated and a hospitalized class. The hospitalized compartment is added due to the high significance of hospitalization number predictions for hospital capacity planning and the assessment of the number of severely diseased individuals during pandemic times. We do not include an exposed compartment, which is a possible first enhancement to the SIR model and incorporates infected people who are not (yet) infectious, that is, those with pre-symptomatic and potentially asymptomatic individuals.
In our model, pre-symptomatic individuals are condensed with symptomatic people in the infected compartment, so that we have a single infected compartment of people not hospitalized. Since determining the proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the total infected population is not our goal at this point, we do not include a class of infected individuals who are asymptomatic, but assume at least very mild symptoms in infected individuals. The degree of infectivity of infected individuals can be controlled by adjusting the transmission rate in the model.
Our model includes a vaccination rate and the proportion of the population vaccinated each week. Therefore, the model is adaptable to different vaccination scenarios. In addition, the general transmissibilities of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, which are constantly changing, lead to altered protective effects of available vaccines. The established model includes a transmission rate explained in Sect. 2.
The main method used in this work, called Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and explained in Sect. 3.1, is used to estimate the transmission rate based on the data available in Germany. The PINN itself combines a data-driven method (here based on compartment size data, e.g., number of infections) with the developed ODE system so that it incorporates physical laws. In other words, this approach trades off between the data-based and physical loss functions in the training process. This reduces the space of

feasible solutions to those that satisfy a `physical law' to some degree, i.e., an SVIHR compartmental model in this case. The ODE system corresponding to the model serves as an additional constraint in the training phase encoded by an appropriate additional residual loss term. More specifically, the PINN loss function consists of the two weighted terms data loss and residual loss. The data loss is calculated as the difference between the current network output in terms of infection or hospitalization numbers and the reported 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) data covering weeks between March 2020 and December 2021. The residual loss is based on a mathematical model with a system of ordinary differential equations that describes the main population dynamics observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. A PINN approach for the simple SIRD model was proposed by Malinzi et al. [11], and a PINN approach for an SIR-based vaccination model was described by Torku et al. [26]. In contrast, Zeroual et al. [28] compared different pure deep learning models for forecasting COVID-19 cases and found the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) algorithm to be superior.
Raissi et al. [17] explain that PINNs are neural networks that embed physics as a regularization term in the loss function. They say that given a sufficient number of data points and an expressive neural network architecture, they can achieve good approximation accuracy if the given differential equation is well-posed and has a unique solution. PINNs can also be viewed as a surrogate model for solving differential equations by incorporating additional data or as a data-driven correction (or even discovery) of the underlying physical system. One motivation for this hybrid approach can be seen in the observed non-compliance of some individuals with social distancing (or physical distancing) and hygiene rules. This behavior is difficult to formulate in ODEs, but it is included in the neural network training data.
Olumoyin et al. [15] use the term Epidemiology-Informed Neural Network (EINN), which describes a type of feedforward neural network that incorporates epidemiological dynamics such as lockdown into its loss function. Their EINN learns solutions for the so-called asymptomatic SIR model, i.e., the proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals to the total number of infected individuals.
Shaier et al. [22] use the term Disease-Informed Neural Networks (DINN) to refer to a type of PINN-based neural network that can be applied to increasingly complex systems of differential equations describing various known infectious diseases. The DINN formulation learns both the representation of the underlying system as a neural network and also performs a calibration (called `Inverse Parameter Estimation') for the assumed ODE system model. In this way, it can be used to predict the infection rates, etc.
As our PINN operates based on transmission and transition dynamics in a population affected by COVID-19, estimates transmission rate parameters, and incorporates a transmission rate that can incorporate remedial measures, such as quarantine and contact restrictions, our PINN can be described as a special type of EINN designed to predict COVID-19 incidence. Because our PINN uses a system of differential equations to learn the parameters that generate it, this PINN can also be considered a DINN. Our approach of using PINN-identified parameters of an ODE system to predict infection and hospitalization rates by using the PINN itself in a slightly modified form and a numerical method of NSFD is innovative. The uniqueness of our approach lies in the fact that we use our PINN for parameter identification and give it a second input of initial compartment size data to generate accurate future compartment size scenarios, and then apply a purely nu-

merical method so that we can compare the predictions of the data- and ODE-based PINN with their predictions.
The data used consist of infection and hospitalization rates as well as vaccination, death, and cure rates for Germany obtained from the RKI [18, 19]. The PINN also works based on the established dynamic ODE system, which forms the core of the model and is developed in Sect. 2. The transmission rate is one of the most important parameters affecting the occurrence of infections and thus the established ODE system. Therefore, changes in transmissibility due to mutations or altered susceptibility of the underlying population are part of the model-based predictions.
The exact procedures used in this work are described in Sect. 3.2 and Sect. 3. In this work, the estimation of certain model-specific parameters is performed by the PINN mentioned above. A model-specific non-standard finite difference scheme (NSFD) is a numerical integration method for comparison and validation.
The data on which our implementations are based covers the calendar weeks 10 in 2020 through 14 in 2022, obtained from the inquiries of the German Robert-Koch Institute (RKI). Different weights for the loss terms are used as examples in the prediction section to analyze the impact of weight modification.

2 Model structure In this work, an SVIHR compartmental model was developed based on the basic SIR model introduced by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927. The SIR model consists of three compartments of susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) individuals. Susceptible individuals have not yet become infected but may become ill. Infected individuals have already become infected. In the basic SIR model, they can also infect susceptible persons. Therefore, they are assumed to be infectious and may or may not have symptoms. Recovered individuals have overcome the disease and are no longer ill.

2.1 The SIR model in epidemiology The basic SIR model assumes that no births or deaths enter the system, that the population is closed so that no one enters or leaves a compartment from the outside, and that recovered individuals are completely immune so that they can never be reinfected. The total size of the population at a time t is denoted by N(t). The satisfaction of the equation

N(t) = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) with N : [0, T]  N,

means that the number of individuals in the system is the sum of the compartment sizes at each time point considered t  [0, T]. The system must have initial conditions S(0), I(0), R(0) to be well-defined [12, p. 11]. The population size N(t) is constant if the derivative of N(t) is zero. If there is no natural death rate and no recruitment or birth rate in the system, or if the natural death rate and recruitment rate equilibrate, this constancy is given. The individuals in the system are infected, i.e., they migrate from compartment S to I at a rate  (t), which is defined as

 (t) :=  (t)(1 - q)I(t),

(1)

where  is the transmission risk, and  (t) is a time-dependent contact rate. The parameter q symbolizes the degree of strength of intervention, quarantine, and isolation measures

implemented. For example, when more infectious individuals are isolated, fewer further infections occur. The rate

S(t)

(t) :=  (t)

(2)

N (t)

is called a standard incidence rate, and  (t) is the force of infection and is called the transmission rate.

2.2 The SVIHR model The basic model is extended in this work to include a vaccinated compartment V and a hospitalized compartment H. Infected individuals remain infected for TI days until they recover, when a proportion  of all transiting individuals are hospitalized. Thus, the rate 1 at which persons per unit time (week) pass from compartment I to R is given by

1- 1 = TI , (3)

and the rate  at which individuals are reach the compartment H per unit of time is defined as



= .

(4)

TI

Hospitalized individuals are assumed to infect susceptible individuals only to a neglectable degree due to their isolated state and good hygienic precautions. They remain infected for TH days from the time of their hospitalization. A proportion M of the individuals transiting from the compartment I to H is assumed to die from disease-related causes. The rate 2 at which persons per unit time pass from compartment H to R is given by

1-M 2 = TH . (5)

Susceptibles reach the compartment V at a rate V. The condition for the transition from the compartment S to V is receiving a second vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Since vaccination does not guarantee complete immunity to infection, i.e., we speak of a leaky vaccination, it is assumed that vaccinated individuals in the system may contract the infection with a small probability. The respective rate at which vaccinated individuals pass into the infected compartment I is  (t), where  denotes the residual probability of infection after vaccination.
BioNTech/Pfizer's Comirnaty and Moderna's Spikevax vaccines are about 95% effective, AstraZeneca's Vaxzevria vaccine is about 80% effective, and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine is about 65% effective. Thus, a leaky-vaccinated compartment is assumed rather than an all-or-nothing vaccinated compartment. Because leakiness was assumed, all vaccinated individuals have a lower probability of contracting the infection than susceptible individuals in compartment S. When an all-or-nothing vaccine was assumed, vaccination provided complete protection from infection to a portion V of the susceptible class per unit time t, whereas the 1 - V portion received no protection.
Finally, we include a constant system inflow, the birth rate (e.g., birth of new individuals that can get infected, and the natural mortality rate ). A constant rate  =  (1 - q)

is used in the implementations of the PINN. The corresponding system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) has the following form in which we set  = 1 and q = 0:

The total population is now defined as

N(t) = S(t) + V (t) + I(t) + H(t) + R(t).

Since the pandemic has a faster dynamic than the birthrate and the natural mortality, N(t) can be regarded as a conserved quantity of the above ODE system if we set and  to zero.
The dynamical system described by equation (6) is depicted in Fig. 1. Blue arrows from one compartment to another indicate a transition, where the compartment from which a red dashed arrow emanates can infect susceptibles.

3 Methods Data were obtained from the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) [18, 19] and the German COVID-19 vaccination dashboard [4]. They refer to the calendar week 10 in 2020 through 14 in 2022. Our validation was based on the calendar weeks 10 in 2020 through 52 in 2021. The first omicron wave initially emerged in October 2021 and lasted until the end of December 2021 [16]. Since the omicron variant was responsible for high infection, reaching a peak of almost 3000 daily infections per 1 million people on March 31st 2022 [16] and our PINN should be adapted to this variant, the first omicron wave was included in the data of

our validation runs. A local maximal incidence of 691 daily infections per 1 million inhabitants was attained on December 1st 2021 [16]. Weekly case-hospitalization, case-fatality, and vaccination rates were computed on the basis of the given data sets. The RKI registers deceased individuals who have been identified as having the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen as those who died from COVID-19. In Sect. 3.1, the approach of PINN is explained. Section 3.2 explains the technical procedure of building the PINN. In Sect. 3.3, the technique of Nonstandard Finite Difference Schemes (NSFD) is explained.

3.1 Physics-informed neural networks for compartment models The basic concept of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) is to incorporate the laws of dynamical systems modeled by ordinary or partial differential equations into a deep learning framework. The loss function of the corresponding neural network includes not only solely the so-called loss error related to the difference between the output of the network and the reported data used but also the so-called residual error related to the ODEs or PDEs. The sum of these two errors is then minimized in the least squares sense.
The weighted loss function consists of the data loss and the residual loss term. As pointed out in [9], the training using the data loss (i.e., measurements, physicsuninformed) is regarded as supervised learning while the training w.r.t. the residual loss using the governing differential equation (physics-informed) is regarded unsupervised learning.
Let the vector  of all parameters included in (6) be given by

 = [,  , q, V, ,  , TI, TH , M, , ] .

(7)

The parameters in  can be partitioned into fixed parameters pf and trainable parameters p, which we select as follows:

pf := [ , q, V,  , TI, TH , M, , ] , p := [, ] .

We selected  and  as the trainable parameters in the network because no reliable or clear values for them could be found in studies.

Scalar time instances tj are fit as input to our network. Let

K^ j = K^ 1,j, . . . , K^ n,j , j  {1, . . . , l}

be the vector of the reported sizes of those n compartments at time instance tj. If K denotes the n compartments, we express the terms on the right-hand side of (6) by

Fp(K) = Fp1(K), . . . , Fpn(K) ,

where n is the number of compartments, i.e. n = 5 in the case of the SVIHR model. It holds that Fpd = Fpd(K(t))  C(R5), for all d  {1, . . . , n}. The system of ODEs in (6) have the following form

dK(t) - Fp(K) = 0, j  {1, . . . , l}. (9) dt
We define T := [t1, . . . , tl] as the vector of input time instances. We obtain one output of the PINN per training iteration. Per kth training iteration Zk, k  {1, . . . , M}, we compute the usual data error defined as
MSEU = MSEU (W , p, Zk) := 1l l PIN N Wp ,Zk (tj) - K^ j 2. (10)

3.2 Procedures of building the PINNs

A single feed-forward PINN was used for each infected compartments I and H. This was

done so that separate parameter vectors p := [, ] were estimated per run of the neural

network for I and H. Among all model parameters, it is the most difficult to assign realistic

values to  and  from raw data. The recruitment and natural death rate are set to zero as

they are regarded as equal here, but are still included in the system of ODEs to be able to

derive the denominator function in the NSFD scheme, see Sect. 3.3. Values for the case-

fatality, the case-hospitalization, and the vaccination rate were computed from the avail-

able RKI data [18, 19]. The fixed model parameters were computed as V = 0.013517486,

 = 0.079718848 and M = 0.026720524 from the given data sets [18, 19]. According to the

RKI, contagiosity strongly recedes after a mean of 10 days of infectedness [21]. In an arti-

cle on hospitalization of COVID-19 cases compared to flu epidemics, the mean duration

of COVID-19-induced hospitalization in Germany was 10 days, while the length of stay in

hospital for people transferred to the intensive care unit was 16 days, and the hospital so-

journ time for persons on mechanical ventilation, on average, was 18 days [24]. We set the

parameter concerning the length of stay in the infected state to TI = 1.42 weeks and used

a slightly higher value of TH = 1.5 weeks for the hospital sojourn time in our implementa-

tions. We selected the transmission rate  and the transmission variation coefficient for

the vaccinated  as trainable parameters. In further implementations or using a different

model, other or more model parameters could be selected as trainable.

We used three hidden linear layers with 5 neurons each for the parameter identification

part and 6 hidden layers with 350 neurons each for the compartment size prediction part

of the PINN. A linear output layer was applied to obtain a compartment size output, and

a ReLU output layer was used for the trained parameter vector. ReLu or tanh functions

were used as activation functions per layer. The Adam algorithm was selected as the op-

timizer. The used learning rate was lr = 0.003. Different layers and activation functions

were tested and compared with respect to output compartment size curves. The selected

ones yielded the most reasonable size ranges. The ReLU output layer was used for the

parameter vector prediction, particularly because non-negative values were wanted. To

Results of the compartment size and trainable parameter vector predictions of the PINN

are described in Sect. 4.

Subsequently, the prognosticated parameters  and  were used as the inputs to a non-

standard finite difference (NSFD) scheme in a validation process. NSFD schemes are ex-

plained in Sect. 3.3. They preserve certain properties like the positivity or the asymptotic

behavior of the analytic solution of differential equations on the discrete level. Their most

Berkhahn and Ehrhardt Advances in Continuous and Discrete Models

(2022) 2022:61

Page 11 of 27

important characteristic is, in many cases, the complete absence of the elementary numerical instabilities which plague common finite difference schemes [13].
In the whole validation procedure, the errors between the predictions obtained through these two methods and the actual available data were analyzed and compared. The corresponding results can be found in Sect. 4.1. For the PINN implementations the PyTorch Library was used.

3.3 Nonstandard finite difference schemes NSFD methods for the numerical integration of differential equations had their origin in a paper by Mickens published in 1989 [13]. In this section, an NSFD scheme is constructed to satisfy the essential positivity condition and the conservation law for =  = 0 which leads as a byproduct to the stability of the scheme. The interested reader may also check that the equilibrium points of the ODE model also appear in the proposed NSFD-scheme. We recall that schemes such as those based on Runge-Kutta methods [5] can produce `false' or `spurious' fixed-points, which are not fixed points of the original ODE system, cf. [14]. Finally, we will determine the so-called denominator function, such that we obtain the correct long-time behavior. We refer to [27], where we established an NSFD scheme for a similar compartment model as here. We implemented a simultaneous parameter estimation using a nonlinear least squares minimization of the error between time series compartment size data and the result of the NSFD-based integration of the respective system of ODEs. This does not equal the data or residual loss of our PINN approach used in this paper. With the optimized parameters and the NSFD scheme, we generated future COVID-19 scenarios. Here, we are now able to compare NSFD results to the results obtained using neural networks.
A numerical scheme for a system of first-order differential equations is called NSFD scheme if at least one of the following conditions [13] is satisfied:
· The orders of the discrete derivatives should be equal to the orders of the corresponding derivatives appearing in the differential equations.
· Discrete representations for derivatives must, in general, have nontrivial denominator functions. Here, the first-order derivatives in the system are approximated by the generalized forward difference method (forward Euler method) ddutn  un+1(h-)un , where un  u(tn) and   (h) > 0 is the so-called denominator function such that (h) = h + O(h2), with h the step size. This function (h) is chosen so that the discrete solution has the same asymptotic behavior as the analytical solution.
· The nonlinear terms are approximated by non-local discrete representations, for instance, by a suitable function of several points of a mesh, like u2(tn)  unun+1 or u3(tn)  u2nun+1.
· Special conditions that hold for either the ODE and/or its solutions should also apply to the difference equation model and/or its solution, e.g., positivity of the solution, convexity of the solution (in finance), equilibrium points of the ODE system, including their local asymptotic stability properties.
In NSFD schemes, derivatives must be modeled by discrete analogues that take the form, cf. [13]

where tn = nh, un is the approximation of u(tn), and (h) = 1 + O(h). The purpose of this more general time discretization (16) in NSFD schemes is to properly model the asymptotic long-time behavior of the solution.
Next, we propose the following NSFD discretization for solving the ODE system (6)

Sn+1 - Sn =
(h)

- InSn+1 - (V + )Sn+1,

V n+1 - V n = VSn+1 - InSn+1 - V n+1, (h)

In+1(h-)In = (1 + )In+1Sn+1 - ( + 1 + )In+1, (17)

Hn+1 - Hn = In+1 - (2 + )Hn+1, (h)

Rn+1 - Rn = 1In+1 + 2Hn+1 - Rn+1, (h)

with a denominator function (h) to be determined later, given by (26). Let us briefly comment on the discretizations of the nonlinear (here: quadratic) terms. For example, in the first line (17), we have discretized the nonlinear contact term I(t)S(t) in (6) by InSn+1 rather than, say, InSn or In+1Sn+1. The rule is that exactly one factor of the variable appearing in the time derivative (here S) must be taken at the new time level n + 1. This is needed to obtain a positivity preserving scheme, see (18). Not to destroy the explicit sequential evaluation, all other variables are taken from the previous time level, unless they are already known from a previous step, like In+1Sn+1 in the third line. If possible, discrete conservation properties (here: total population) must also be taken into account.
Observe that although the initial scheme (17) can be considered implicit, the variables at the (n + 1)-th discrete-time level can be explicitly calculated in terms of the previously known variable values as given in the sequence of the equations above, i.e. we can rewrite it as an explicit form

Sn+1 = Sn + (h) , 1 + (h)(In + )

V n+1 = V n + (h)Sn+1(V - In) , 1 + (h)

n+1

In

I = 1 + ( + 1 +  - (1 + )Sn+1) ,

(18)

Hn+1 = (h)In+1 + Hn , 1 + (2 + )

Rn+1 = Rn + (h)(1In+1 + 2Hn+1) . 1 + (h)

The calculation must be done in exactly this order. All parameters appearing in these type of epidemic models are always non-negative. This is the convention used in fields related to the spread of diseases. From the explicit representation (17), it is easy to deduce that this scheme preserves the positivity, given some natural conditions on the parameters.

Berkhahn and Ehrhardt Advances in Continuous and Discrete Models

Page 13 of 27

Finally, it only remains to correctly determine the denominator function (h). To do so, we reconsider the total population N = S + V + I + H + R of the ODE system (6), now without neglecting and . Adding the equations of (6), we easily obtain the following differential equation describing the dynamics of the total population N

dN (t)

= - N(t).

It is solved by

N(t) = + N(0) - e-t = N(0) + N(0) - e-t - 1 ,

(20)







with N(0) = S(0)+V (0)+I(0)+H(0)+R(0). From (20), we immediately deduce that we have in the long term limt N(t) = /. Let us briefly note that this link between the transient dynamics and their `natural' limiting systems can be used to reduce the dimension of this model, cf. [3]. Next, adding the equations in the discrete NSFD model (17) yields

N n+1 - N n = + (1 + ) In+1 - In Sn+1 - N n+1, (21) (h)

and for the purpose of studying the asymptotic behavior, we assume that I is stationary, In+1 = In, such that the second term in (21) vanishes:

N n+1 - N n = - N n+1, (22) (h)

i.e.

N n+1 = N n + (h) = N n - N n -

(h)

1 + (h)

(23)

= Nn + Nn -

1 -1 .

The denominator function can be derived by comparing Equation (22) with the discrete version of Equation (20), that is

N n+1 = N n + N n -

e-h - 1 , h = t,

(24)



such that the (positive) denominator function is defined by

1 = e-h,

(25)

1 + (h)

i.e.

(h) = eh - 1 = 1 + h + 12 2h2 + · · · - 1 = h + h2 + · · · = h + O h2 .

(26)

Note that the conservation property requires all the denominator functions (h) for the compartments to be the same.

4 Results The results are separated into the validation of the PINN for infection and hospitalization number prediction, given in Sect. 4.1 and Sect. 4.2. A prediction of infection numbers of our PINN for different assignments of the parameter weighting the two loss terms is provided in Sect. 4.3.
The trained PINN identifies the parameters  and . The data set K^ = [S^, V^ , I^, H^ , R^ ] is used in the loss computation. The wanted vector of trainable parameters obtained from the trained neural network varied between different test runs. The size of the respective compartment I or H, the size of which is obtained as a second output of the PINN, partly depends on the architecture of the network, that was improved during the validation process. Values of the two trainable parameters obtained from PINN are later used as the inputs to further Python codes used for the formation of future SARS-CoV-2 scenarios. In the following, the term training iteration is used for one step with loss computation and parameter update, and a training refers to one training epoch containing multiple training iterations.
4.1 Validation process: infection rates At first, we investigated what values the PINN estimated for the two trainable parameters. The PINN identified   [0.0005, 0.0015] and   [0.07 · 10-8, 0.52 · 10-8] within 200 trainings if only 5000 training iterations were used. If 20,000 training iterations were used, the PINN identified   [0.0009, 0.0011] and   [0.19 · 10-8, 0.22 · 10-8] within another 200 trainings. The decrease in the identified interval shows a positive effect of the increase in the number of training iterations on the performance of the PINN in terms of parameter identification. As input to the NSFD scheme, we used  = 0.001 and attempted   [0.18 · 10-8, 0.22 · 10-8] to investigate and compare resulting curves with the reported data.
Figure 2 shows the loss obtained in a run of the PINN for the estimation of the trainable parameters.
It can be seen that the data loss MSEU , computed as the mean squared error between reported and network-generated compartment size data using the Python function MSELoss, decreases by more than 90% between the first and the 640th training iteration. This means that the updated sizes of the compartment I approaches the reported infec-

tion numbers by weight updates of the neural network during training in these iterations. Then, it remains on a level of approximately 0.17 · 109. The residual loss MSEF increases from 1.079 to a maximal value of 2.838 · 109 during the same number of iterations, then is very marginally reduced to around 2.710 · 109, and remains on this level. The training loss consequently decreases from 5.8 · 109 in the beginning to 2.2 · 109 in the 640th training pass, remaining on this level, and was thus reduced by 62%. The obtained sizes of the loss, MSEU and MSEF over the course of several iterations of one training depend, among others, on the size of , but a decreasing loss was observed in all performed trainings with different  and for both the prediction of infection and hospitalization numbers. In Fig. 2, the x-axis contains only 1000 iterations to put the focus on the initial behavior of the three functions, but we actually used 20,000 iterations in the following validation part.
Secondly, we conducted a validation by measuring how close the prediction of our PINN with different assignments of the weighting parameter  approximated the reported data. The target was to find out which weighting of the data and residual loss in the loss function results in the best approximation, as well as to generally evaluate the suitability of our PINN for predictions.
Our PINN uses labeled training data, i.e., compartment sizes K^ assigned to specific weeks ti, i  {1, . . . , l}, in every training iteration. As training data are not unlabeled here, we cannot describe our PINN approach as an unsupervised neural network. Nonetheless, our PINN is not a typical kind of supervised classification network but learns the course of an infectious disease in a data- and model-driven way. As a consequence, our validation does not consist of a sensitivity or specificity analysis, which is typically conducted for supervised neural networks. We focus on the investigation of the predicted trends with their local maxima and minima during the course of the pandemic from August 2021. We also compute errors to be able to more specifically compare the results obtained with different weighting parameter values.
The time period that predictions refer to, which is 27 or 35 calendar weeks here, always has to be considered. A predicted time period of half or two-thirds of a year is reasonable with respect to COVID-19 scenarios because it covers approximately one large wave of the pandemic, which may have several local peaks and usually has one global peak. So in the context of COVID-19, the term long-term prediction can be associated with the prediction of one following wave that is dominated by infections with a specific variant of the virus. A short-term prediction can be described as a forecast of e.g. the next local peak within a wave then. Another interpretation of a short-term prediction is a forecast based on certain most current data, which could be data referring to the last experienced wave or high peak during the pandemic. In our following validation, we do not restrict the training data to the most recent peak of the omicron wave but still incorporate all three experienced peaks during the omicron wave into our training data. A corresponding aim is that the PINN shall be able to foresee peaks in the height of the ones substantially caused by omicron infections and is simultaneously adapted to various virus variants.
It is also significant to consider the data set with which the training procedure works. Depending on different viral mutations and also state intervention or compliance of the population during the pandemic, the underlying data set varies, certain parameters in the system of ODEs must be adapted, and possible predictions change. For instance, the high infection rates during the B.1.1.529 (omicron) wave with 58,107 daily new infections on

Berkhahn and Ehrhardt Advances in Continuous and Discrete Models

November 28th 2021 (local maximum), 192,396 daily new infections on February 10th 2022 and 251,509 daily new infections on March 31st 2022 (global maximum) cannot be foreseen if not enough weeks in which the omicron variant was dominant are included [16]. We incorporated data reaching until the end of the year 2021, which was after the first COVID-19 wave with a dominant omicron variant.
Figure 3 shows the weekly infection rates published by the RKI and the respective prediction of the PINN for three different choices of the weighting parameter  in three different diagrams. In all three plots, three forecasts obtained from using the NSFD scheme based on three different choices of the transmission risk parameter  are included. The black curve is the same in the three diagrams below and reflects the reported data. The same NSFD predictions are shown in all four diagrams of Fig. 3, but a distinct PINN prediction is depicted in each diagram.

The used training data cover the calendar weeks 10 in 2020 through 52 in 2021 (1st through 96th regarded week)

In Fig. 3, the points in time at which real local peaks (black curve) were attained are the 91st regarded week (calendar week 47, 2021) with 403,329 weekly new infections, the 102nd regarded week (calendar week 6, 2022) with 1,307,475 weekly new infections and the 108th regarded week (calendar week 12, 2022) with 1,571,595 weekly new infections. We note that the choice of the parameter  has a considerable effect on performance of the NSFD scheme. In the approximation of the NSFD scheme, a larger  leads to a higher and earlier reached peak. Exact errors with respect to the reported data are indicated in Table 1. The NSFD scheme seems to be substantially suited for the prediction of specific sizes of maxima during the course of the pandemic, as well as smooth increases in infection numbers. In contrast, the PINN based on the data and residual loss is able to capture smaller peaks and oscillations also within small time periods of a few weeks. The figure may lead to the view that the residual loss might not be crucial since high values of  result in better approximations, but Table 1 shows that a complete omission of the physics-informed part is not the best choice. The computation of the residual loss during the training procedure enables us to incorporate methodical information and knowledge about the disease, which solely data-driven methods do not include.
Figure 3 implies that a larger hyperparameter , i.e., a greater influence of the data loss in the loss function leads to a better approximation of the peak heights. The height of the first local maximum in calendar week 47 is not captured, and it is predicted two weeks too early, but a larger  results in an improvement such that around 220,000 infections are predicted with  = 0.95. In this case, the NSFD scheme with  = 1.98e.9 accounts for the actual peak height of around 400,000 (exactly: 403,329) weekly infections in the 91st regarded week. In contrast to the first, the second maximum of around 1.3 million weekly infections during the omicron phase is approximated very closely by our PINN if  > 0.9 is selected. This can be seen in the second and third visualized diagram. A strong

Berkhahn and Ehrhardt Advances in Continuous and Discrete Models

increase is predicted at the end of the 94th regarded week, although it actually started in the 96th week, but the red an black curves approach each other until they meet in the 101st regarded week (calendar week 5, 2022). Weighting the two loss terms equally, i.e., setting  = 0.5, the second local maximum is predicted as only 800,000 infections such that there is a gap of 500,000 to the reported data. The behavior of the respective predicted curve in regard of increases and decreases is similar to the curve predicted using  > 0.9.
The local minimum after the second peak of the black curve is captured better by the NSFD scheme with  = 1.98 · 10-9 again. The PINN approach predicts a too small local minimum (625,000 with  = 0.95). However, the PINN is able to approximate the third peak (global maximum), whereas the NSFD scheme shows a very slight decrease again. This stresses that the PINN approach is more suited to account for quick changes in the data than the numerical discretization.
As a part of our validation process, we computed the absolute difference between the reported data and compartment size output of the PINN as

l

diff = diffj,

(27)

j=1

where

diffj = K^ j - PIN N Wp j j = 1, . . . , l, (28)

and the mean squared error as

MSEdiff = 1 l diffj2, (29) l
j=1

where l is the number of weeks for which the output of the PINN, and the reported data shall be compared.
In Table 1, the errors for the validation runs of the infection rate prediction are expressed for distinct assignments of the weighting parameter . We selected l = 29 to compare the reported and predicted infection numbers between the 34th calendar week in 2021 and the 10th calendar week in 2022. The parameter  does not occur in the NSFD estimation since it weighs the two loss functions terms of the PINN, and in the PINN approach, the parameter  is estimated so that it does not occur as a parameter of fixed size here.
Table 1 proves that the size of both errors increases the more the smaller  is selected compared to 0.9. We obtain values of diff less than 3.5 · 10-6 if we choose   [0.9, 0.96] and values of MSEdiff less than 0.5 · 10-11 if we choose   0.9. We can observe that both errors increase again for  > 0.95 here. The errors for  = 0.93 are somewhat smaller than for  = 0.96, and the errors for  = 0.9 are smaller than for  = 0.99. This indicates that a small decrease in the computed errors can be achieved by weighting the loss MSEF 5% instead of 0% (or, e.g., 7% instead of 3%) in the loss function. A weight of 0 for MSEF would be given if we did not include any residual loss.
We are regarding a specific scenario with 43 weeks as the training basis and 29 weeks as the validation basis. As already seen in Fig. 3, assigning  = 1.98 · 10-9 in the NSFD scheme yields a predicted curve that meets the local maximum in the 91st regarded week and the

Berkhahn and Ehrhardt Advances in Continuous and Discrete Models

local minimum in the 104th/105th regarded week. The obtained error diff is almost half as small as for  = 2.04 · 10-9, and MSEdiff is more than 3 times smaller. The total difference diff is slightly larger than for the PINN with  = 0.65 and smaller than for the PINN with  = 0.5.
Regarding the errors diff for  = 2.08 · 10-9 or  = 1.12 · 10-9 (13.8549 or 18.8948, respectively), it is obvious that a good choice of the transmission risk parameter is highly relevant for the performance of the NSFD in the forecast. We modified the transmission risk manually here to show the effect on the approximation quality. There exist optimization algorithms in which model parameters are optimized during a process of minimization of the error between reported and numerically predicted data. Our focus is the comparison of PINN predictions with NSFD forecasts based on our compartment model with selected transmission risks in this paper. The NSFD method is eligible for approximating a segment of reported COVID-19 data, substantially a local or global peak. The error reduction is extremely dependent on the parameter choice. As described in the analysis of Fig. 3, the PINN approach seems to be much better suited than the NSFD scheme to predict local fluctuations observed in the reported data and make short-term predictions.
Figure 4 shows the total differences diffj (following: errors) between the reported COVID-19 infection rates and predictions with the PINN and NSFD corresponding to Fig. 3.
The visualization of the differences to the reported data resulting from the choices  = 0.5, 0.95 or  = 1.98 · 10-9, 2.00 · 10-9, 2.04 · 10-9 in Fig. 4 verifies the corresponding results of Table 1. The errors of both methods with any choice of  or  is comparatively small,

Figure 4 Errors between the reported data and the infection numbers obtained with the NSFD scheme with three different assignments of the transmission risk parameter , and the PINN with weighting parameter  = 0.5 (upper diagram) or  = 0.95 (lower diagram), and for the 29 calendar weeks starting from August 23rd 2021 (34th calendar week in 2021)

i.e., below 0.2 · 106, during the first 10 predicted weeks. We must take into account that the prediction refers to the time at which the highest infection rates experienced during the whole COVID-19 pandemic occurred. Consequently, prediction errors will be larger than in other time periods since the outbreak of COVID-19 that could be regarded.
It can be seen that the niveau of the error of the NSFD with  = 1.98 · 10-9 remains below 0.5 · 106 throughout the 29 weeks, whereas an error peak of 0.88 · 106 is reached in the 17th regarded week if we use  = 2.04 · 10-9. With a higher transmission risk, the NSFD achieves a higher predicted peak.
Data until the third and global maximum of 1,571,595 weekly infections are considered, and  = 2.04 · 10-9 is the only transmission risk choice among the three visualized choices, which yields a peak of 1.5 million weekly infections. Thus, the blue curve ( = 2.04 · 10-9) in Fig. 4 is on the lowest level from the 27th regarded week. We obtain comparatively very small errors with the NSFD scheme at times at which peaks are attained in the reported data.
The error between the NSFD predictions and the reported data is largest at the local minimum between the first and second omicron wave around calendar week 52 in 2021. The error between the PINN prediction and the reported data is largest at the local minimum between second and third omicron wave around calendar week 9 in 2022.
The relatively large error of ·106 with  = 0.5 or 0.73 · 106 with  = 0.95 (PINN approach) in the 28th regarded week is reasoned by the great difference to the reported data (black curve) in the calendar weeks 9 and 10 in 2022 in Fig. 3. The local minimum is predicted as too small by the PINN here. Nevertheless, the PINN actually predicts a local minimum, whereas the NSFD approach predicts a maximum or slightly decreasing infection rates right after a reached maximum here.
Altogether, the PINN with  = 0.95 yields the smallest error level among the five parameter selections ( = 0.5, 0.9,  = 1.98 · 10-9, 2.00 · 10-9, 2.04 · 10-9) during the 29 regarded weeks. It remains below 0.25 · 10-6 until the 25th regarded week.
4.2 Validation process: hospitalization rates The results of the prediction of hospitalization rates are discussed in the sequel. Hospitalization numbers resulting from the application of the NSFD scheme are not included here because we focus on the PINN, which is the main method of this paper. The NSFD scheme applied to another compartment model used for the COVID-19 pandemic data is described in detail in [27]. Table 2 displays the errors defined in Equations (27) and (29) for the validation runs of the hospitalization rate prediction for distinct assignments of the weighting parameter . We selected l = 35 to compare the reported and predicted hospitalization numbers between the 31st calendar week in 2021 and the 14th calendar week in 2022.
As can be seen in Table 2, the PINN performance significantly improves for values  > 0.9, but deteriorates for  > 0.96. This is a similar result as in Table 1, where the best manually generated result was obtained with the assignment  = 0.95.
In the forecast of hospitalization numbers, we obtain smaller errors than in Table 1 since the number of weekly hospitalizations is much smaller than the number of weekly infections. The peak in hospitalizations during the previous course of the COVID-19 pandemic was 12,658 weekly hospitalizations in the calendar week 51 in 2020. The highest peak since August 2021, i.e., during the time of dominance of the omicron variant, was 11,153 in the calendar week 11 in 2022.

Figure 5 Hospitalization numbers obtained from the reported data (black) or the training of the PINN (red) from the 75th regarded week (31st calendar week in 2021) for  = 0.945
It can be noted that the smallest error diff in Table 2 is 1.1439 · 10-5, and the smallest error MSEdiff is 0.180857·10-8. Both are achieved for  = 0.945. The error diff for  = 0.945 is only 31% of the error obtained with  = 0.5 and 24% of the error generated with  = 0.3.
The error diff for  = 0.93 is 20.7% larger than for  = 0.95, whereas the error diff for  = 0.9 is 24.5% smaller than for  = 0.99. In the prediction of hospitalization rates through our PINN, we can thus notice a clearer disadvantage in neglecting the residual loss, i.e., setting  = 1, than in the forecast of infection rates.
Figure 5 shows the hospitalization rates between August 2021 and April 2022 predicted by the PINN with  = 0.945 compared to the reported data corresponding to this time period.
The increase in hospitalization between the 75th and 91st regarded week (calendar weeks 31 through 47, i.e., from 2 August to 28 November 2021) has a peak at 10,894 weekly hospitalizations. The PINN also predicts an increase at that time, but a stronger increase peaking at 16,500 hospitalizations in the 87th regarded week. A small decrease of 673 weekly hospitalizations is visible in the reported data between the 80th and 84th regarded week, after which the curve rises stronger than before (1306 weekly hospitalizations between calendar weeks 41 and 47). The prediction of the PINN shows a flattening in the

Berkhahn and Ehrhardt Advances in Continuous and Discrete Models

(2022) 2022:61

Page 22 of 27

83rd and 84th regarded week. It also displays an increase of 1250 weekly hospitalizations between the 81st and 87th regarded week. In the 91st regarded week, the PINN curve exhibits a local maximum of almost 15,000, which is almost 4000 too many hospitalizations.
Between the 91st and 98th regarded week (calendar weeks 47 in 2021 through 4 in 2022), the PINN curve approaches the curve of reported data and crosses it at 6662 infections in the calendar week 3 in 2022. Further overlapping points are 9957 hospitalizations in the 103rd and 9924 hospitalizations in the 106th regarded week, which occurs during an increase in hospitalization numbers in both the reported and predicted data between the 98th and 107th regarded week, with a short decrease of 374 hospitalizations visible in the reported data between the 104th and 105th week.
In the prediction of the PINN, the 9924 hospitalizations in the 106th regarded week define a maximum, whereas a local peak of 11,153 hospitalizations is observable in the reported data one week later. Both curves decline with approximately the same slope after reaching their respective peak. Subsequently, the curve generated with the reported data ends at 6813 hospitalizations in the 110th regarded week (calendar week 14 in 2022) and the predicted curve terminates at 4000 hospitalizations.
With respect to that, the error effected by the PINN in this scenario attains a maximal value of 9500 in the 86th regarded week. It becomes minimal in the 77th, 10th, and 106th regarded week, when the two curves cross each other.
4.3 Infection scenario predicted by the PINN We finally let the PINN predict infection numbers with training data covering the calendar weeks 10 in 2020 through 14 in 2022. We used  = 0.95 for the weighting parameter. The calendar week 14 in 2022 ended on 10 April 2022. The RKI registered 970,745 weekly infections in that week. Due to the clear downward trend since 31 March 2022 visible in the latest data, we assumed a strong decline in infection numbers until the end of May 2022 [16]. In the calendar week 22 in the year 2021, 20,689 new infections were registered by the RKI [18]. Our following prediction starts at the end of May 2022. Figure 6 visualizes scenarios generated with our PINN with seven distinct selections of the weighting parameter.
We can see in both diagrams in Fig. 6 low infection rates are predicted for the whole summer of the year 2022. The weekly rates are below 20,000 during the calendar weeks 22 through 42 in 2022. Sharply increasing infection numbers are forecasted from November 2022, and a maximum is predicted in late January 2023. This is the same for all of the shown selections of the parameter . We can see in the lower diagram, that almost 175,000 weekly infections are obtained at the peak with  = 0.95, which is the value of  that yielded the best approximation in the validation part. The number of infections is similar to the calendar week 44 in 2021, when 177,889 infections were registered by the RKI.
The lower diagram implies a great range in infection rates between choices of  between 0.5 and 0.95, whereas the upper diagram indicates a very small range between choices of  between 0.9 and 0.98 in the PINN approach. This corresponds to our results from Table 1. Using  = 0.5, i.e., a 50% inclusion of the residual loss in the loss function, the predicted maximum is only 100,000 infections. With  = 0.65, the peak is 125,000, and with  = 0.80, it is 148,000 infections. Over the course, a range between the curves of up to 50,000 is observable. In contrast, the maximal range between any two curves in the upper diagram is 10,000. It occurs in the calendar week 45.

Figure 6 Forecast of infection numbers (size of the infected compartment) from the end of May 2022 with the PINN
After a local peak forecasted as 138,000 infections with  = 0.95 in February 2023, infection rates are predicted to decline almost as sharply as they increased, reaching a local minimum at the beginning of April in 2023. This minimum is predicted to be 5000 infections if  = 0.95 is used as the value of the weighting parameter. Despite the inclusion of the two omicron-induced maxima of February and March 2022 (1,307,475 and 1,571,595 weekly new infections), our PINN does not predict as high infection numbers for the end of the year 2022. To be able to better classify the prediction, it has to be considered that the maximal infection rate during the second half of the year 2021 was 403,329 infections in the last week of November, and the maximum during the first half of the year 2021 was 145,494 in the first week of January. It also be minded that a constant vaccination rate is assumed in the model.
Aside from prediction with the PINN and the NSFD scheme in [27], we made a forecast with the NSFD scheme. As an addition to our previous NSFD implementations, we used a time-dependent function (t) for the transmission rate. This function has got the trigonometric shape
(t) = 0 1 + c sin t + t0 . (30)
2
Here, 0 is the initial transmission risk. It was set 0 = 1.99 · 10-9, and we assigned t0 = 25. The parameter c is responsible for the amplitude of the resulting function. It was modified, as the fixed parameter  in our previous implementations to obtain different predictions. Using c = 0.03, 0.05 or 0.07, we obtain a maximal value of 2.0497, 2.0895, or 2.1293 of (t), respectively, and a minimal value of 1.9304, 1.8907, or 1.8509. The first two minima of

Figure 7 Forecast of infection numbers (size of the infected compartment) from the end of May 2022 with the NSFD scheme
(t) are reached 5 and 45 weeks and the first maximum is attained 25 weeks after the observation start, i.e., time t0.
Figure 7 shows a prediction of infection rates of the NSFD scheme from the end of May 2022.
As shown in Fig. 7, the time-variability with a sine function in the transmission rate leads to more than one peak over the course of time. Nonetheless, only one peak is detectable per wave, as in our previous predictions with the NSFD scheme. Using c = 0.07, we have maxima in the 38th and 72nd regarded week, which correspond to late February and late October 2023. With c = 0.05, the maxima are reached in the 39th and 71st regarded week. Using c = 0.03, the peaks are attained in the 42nd and 70th regarded week. It is interesting to note that the second reached peak is higher than the first one in all three cases, but the difference in peak height is approximately 30,000 for c = 0.07, 15,000 for c = 0.05, and 3000 for c = 0.03. Moreover, the first observed peak is achieved at a similar time as in the prediction of the PINN in Fig. 6, where it was reached in the 34th regarded week. If we use  = 0.95 in the forecast of the PINN, the peak in Fig. 6 with a size of almost 175,000 is on a similar level as the first observable maximum in the given predictions with the NSFD scheme in Fig. 7. Their heights are approximately 190,000 with c = 0.07, 185,000 with c = 0.05, and 182,000 with c = 0.03. Figure 7 illustrates that a local minimum is attained in the 54th regarded week, i.e., in early June 2023. This is the case for all three assignments of the parameter c. If we set c = 0.03, the is reached at approximately 168,000 weekly infections. Using c = 0.05, the reached value is 145,000. With c = 0.03, we obtain only 127,000 weekly infections at the minimum.
5 Conclusion and outlook We have presented a data- and physics-driven deep learning algorithm that identifies the transmission parameter  and the parameter , which represents the proportion of transmissibility in the vaccinated population, in a system of ordinary differential equations of a compartmental model describing population dynamics at pandemic times. For this purpose, we used a physics-informed neural network (PINN) whose loss function combines a weighted data loss with a weighted residual loss, which in turn is based on the compartment model applied to the respective current network output.
Using COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, vaccination, and mortality data from Germany, we calculated the prediction error of a non-standard finite difference scheme

(NSFD) [13] and the PINN we developed. During the validation process, we slightly adjusted the parameters of the NSFD scheme and the network architecture of the PINN so that we obtained resulting plots that approximate the trend of the real course of infection numbers.
Depending on the choice of the transmission rate, the performance of the NSFD scheme varies in approximating the course of the pandemic. Slight changes can lead to large changes in the prediction in terms of the slope and the height reached by the peak of the curve. For example, a 4 · 10-10 increase in transmission risk from 2.00 · 10-9 to 2.04 · 10-9 resulted in a maximum reached two weeks earlier and 0.32 · 106 higher, and a 2 · 10-10 decrease in risk from 2.00 · 10-9 to 1.98 · 10-9 resulted in a maximum reached one week later and 0.9 · 105 smaller (see Fig. 3). The scenarios drawn in our validation part can be described as long-term predictions in the way that data from the outbreak of the pandemic in Germany until the end of 2021 are used in the training set. We did not include data from just a single peak within a wave or a single wave here, as we wanted an algorithm that was adapted to a wide range of virus variants. It should also be adapted to the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in all four seasons, which would not be given if only one wave or even one local peak were included in the training data.
PINN seem better suited to account for multiple local maxima within a wave than the NSFD scheme, as it is able to capture outliers or small oscillations in a given set of real infection or hospitalisation data and transfer them into its prediction. The clear advantage of PINN over discrete numerical methods is its data orientation, so that it does not rely solely on a mathematical model described by a system of differential equations, which certainly cannot capture all aspects or dynamics of infectious disease. The importance of data loss is evidenced by the fact that predictions of our PINN with assignments  > 0.9, i.e., a clearly dominant influence of the data error MSEU , led to resulting curve predictions that were closer to the reported data of the 30 weeks considered than with assignments  < 0.9. Indeed, our results, particularly those in Table 1, show a sharp decline in PINN performance for decreasing values of the weighting parameter.
With regard to the prediction of the NSFD scheme, the inclusion of time variability in the transmission rate showed that the NSFD scheme is able to accommodate the prediction of more than one wave, each with a maximum. It is important that the parameters used in the time-dependent transmission function are chosen appropriately. If the NSFD scheme were to be used for an actual prediction of the next wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the parameters c would need to be reliably estimated.
Nevertheless, the residual term allows us to incorporate systematic knowledge about the spread and transmission dynamics of the disease into our neural network. The differential equations make the network a physically informed and partially mathematical approach. No mathematical model is able to perfectly describe an infectious disease such as COVID-19 because, for example, new mutant variants emerge and intervention measures or population compliance change over time, and not every epidemiological detail relevant to transmission is known. However, the values of certain fixed parameters can be derived from elaborate studies, knowledge of a possible next mutation, intervention, or vaccination strategy can be incorporated, and SIR-type models provide clues to transition dynamics that the neural network can work with. Our variant of the SIR model, i.e., the SVIHR model, was developed because we wanted to include leaky vaccination to account for the reduced infectiousness of individuals in the fully vaccinated case, and we wanted

Berkhahn and Ehrhardt Advances in Continuous and Discrete Models

(2022) 2022:61

Page 26 of 27

to focus on predicting the number of hospitalizations as an important part of pandemicrelated policy and hospital occupancy planning.
We found similar best values for the residual and data loss weight parameter when observing infection and hospitalization rates. Our results show the best performance of PINN for  = 0.95 in terms of predicting infection rates and  = 0.945 for predicting hospitalization rates, implying a non-negligible weight of 5% and 5.5%, respectively, of residual loss in the loss function used during the training procedure.
We briefly remark that an even more accurate way to compute the denominator function would take into account the transition rate i at which the ith compartment is entered by individuals for all model compartments Ki, i = 1, 2, . . . [6]. In this case, the parameter  occurring in the denominator function in Equation (26) would be replaced by a parameter 1/T. T could be determined as the minimum of the inverse transition parameters:

T = min

1 .

i=1,2,... i

In our future work, time-varying functions for vaccination and transmission rate will be included to account for seasonal and variant-dependent fluctuations, cf. [8]. In addition, the prediction of hospitalization rates can be refined by including more precise knowledge than the transmission risk, the hospitalisation rate, and the average length of stay in a hospital. For example, the Bayesian method could be a tool to estimate the weekly demand for hospital beds. We will also incorporate an adaptive learning rate into our code.

Database of SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses kinetics relevant for assessing persistence in food processing plants
Ngoc-Du Martin Luong 1, Laurent Guillier 1, Sandra Martin-Latil2, Christophe Batejat3, India Leclercq3, Christine Druesne 4, Moez Sanaa1 & Estelle Chaix1

SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), a virus causing severe acute respiratory disease in humans, emerged in late 2019. This respiratory virus can spread via aerosols, fomites, contaminated hands or surfaces as for other coronaviruses. Studying their persistence under different environmental conditions represents a key step for better understanding the virus transmission. This work aimed to present a reproducible procedure for collecting data of stability and inactivation kinetics from the scientific literature. The aim was to identify data useful for characterizing the persistence of viruses in the food production plants. As a result, a large dataset related to persistence on matrices or in liquid media under different environmental conditions is presented. This procedure, combining bibliographic survey, data digitalization techniques and predictive microbiological modelling, identified 65 research articles providing 455 coronaviruses kinetics. A ranking step as well as a technical validation with a Gage Repeatability & Reproducibility process were performed to check the quality of the kinetics. All data were deposited in public repositories for future uses by other researchers.

Background & Summary
The first cases of coronaviruses disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in China in December 2019 and spread afterwards quickly around different countries from around January-February 20201. From the first months of viral dissemination, SARS-CoV-2 clusters were observed, in particular in occupational environments for several essential sectors such as health care centres2,3 or food processing plants4-7. The transmission of coronaviruses among humans was reported as possibly through aerosol (inhalation of aerosolized or falling contaminated droplets) or through contact (hand, objects or surfaces)8,9. Infected persons (symptomatic or asymptomatic) can send out several contaminated droplets that could stay in aerosol, be directly inhaled or fall on surfaces and potentially infect afterwards other persons. However, the changes of the infectious viral load in the contaminated droplets susceptible to be inhaled and to induce disease are not well known in either aerosol or surfaces. Furthermore, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 depends on environmental conditions that are very different from one occupational location to another10,11. Some factors such as airflow, ventilation, temperature and relative humidity modify the probability of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through respiratory pathways since it can affect droplet movements and virus survival, notably through droplet desiccation12. Some studies reported the influence of few temperature and/or relative humidity conditions. For example, the virus remains infectious for longer periods at lower temperatures and very high relative humidity10, metal surfaces such as stainless steel could allow the virus to remain infectious longer than on others under some specific temperature-humidity conditions13,14. Studies on coronaviruses persistence were generally conducted by experiments in laboratory consisting in monitoring the virus kinetics under controlled conditions. The reduction of virus infectivity over time could be evaluated by fitting inactivation mathematical models on experimental data. Studying the effects of environmental conditions encountered in food premises requires collecting kinetics data as exhaustively as

possible to cover large ranges of values for each condition: inert or food surfaces, temperature, relative humidity, experimental quantification method, virus strain etc. To our knowledge, such exhaustive kinetics dataset are not available yet in the literature. It should also be noted that the gathering of data between different studies is not easy. For example, kinetics are frequently plotted in research articles but raw data are not often provided in all of them as quantitative (numerical) values that can be used for further studies of theirs.
Thus, the main goal of this paper was to collect and make available the compilation of a large dataset of quantitative kinetics related to SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses under different conditions useful for assessing and modelling their persistence in food processing environments.
Methods
The overall procedure for collecting and pre-treating literature data is briefly illustrated in Fig. 1. Firstly, a literature review to identify relevant publications presenting kinetics data was carried out. This research was based on a query of scientific bibliographical databases in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines15 (Step 1). The second step consisted in converting raw data from scientific publications (texts, tables or figures) into a ready-to-use numerical dataset with a manual collection for tables or a semi-automated collection after digitalization of figures (Step 2). Afterwards, an inactivation primary model was fitted on each kinetics to estimate the viral infectivity reduction parameter and its uncertainty (Step 3). Finally, a quality-ranking step (Step 4) was performed to evaluate the quality of the data collected from kinetics. The quantitative dataset and the different tools used in this procedure are freely available and detailed in the following sub-sections.
Scoping review. The scoping review is part of a scientific project to describe the persistence of coronaviruses in food production environments. Firstly, a query process was carried out to identify relevant records, using weekly advanced searches on several topics associated with SARS-CoV-2. This weekly literature search was conducted between March 2020 and 25th August 2021 using a combination of keywords related to the main thematic (1) "SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus" joined by the logical connector AND with one of the following (2a) "Human and food", (2b) "Water" or (2c) "Environmental persistence". The keywords used for each theme are specified in Table 1. Studies were collected weekly from two bibliographic search engines PubMed and Scopus (from March 2020 to August 2021) and by query on Frontiers (from November 2020 to August 2021). A date restriction was defined: only publications from the 1st of January 2020 were collected. The search was limited to publications with abstracts written in English. The last query process using those above-mentioned criteria performed on the 25th of August 2021 identified overall 14,267 references exported to EndNote software, after duplicate removal. From this corpus, a thematic filter about "Persistence" was built with a "from group" tools in EndNote software. This filter consisted in selecting articles with "persisten*" "survival" or "stability" in the field "Title-Abstract-Keywords", joined by the logical connector AND with "environment*". This search resulted in 418 references. These records were afterwards filtered in accordance with the PRISMA Statement guidelines15 (Fig. 2), using different inclusion/ exclusion criteria based on title, abstract and sometimes full-text when needed. The inclusion criteria were (1)

studies on persistence on materials, surfaces or aerosols or (2) studies on working environment. The exclusion criteria were (1) studies on therapeutic or vaccine development, (2) studies on untreated wastewater, (3) studies on diet or nutrition (4) language other than English and French, and (5) full text not available. A first screening step identified 82 references for which full papers were read to determine if they were included as fully documented kinetics of persistence data (either in tables or in figures) or used to complete the identification of relevant publications (e.g. in the case of reviews). All the above screening and completion stages identified a final total number of 65 studies in which available raw kinetics data could be extracted from tables and/or figures.
Information associated with kinetics data. The second step consisted in converting raw data from scientific publications into ready-to-use numerical dataset by extracting data from texts, tables and/or using figure digitalization techniques. This step provided several "kinetics", meaning the tracking of viral titer at different time points under different conditions. Kinetics corresponding to viral genome quantification (e.g. by RT-qPCR techniques) were excluded since such quantification did not represent the viral infectivity. In total, 464 kinetics were available from the 65 identified studies11,13,14,16-77 (Tables 2 and 3). It is worth noting that kinetics for coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2 collected in these studies were also retained for analyses.
Several information associated with the above kinetics were gathered in an Excel spreadsheet (more details in the Data records section). For each identified kinetics, we assigned a unique kinetics key. The virus Strains, Species, Subgenus and Genus were indicated for each kinetics, as well as other conditions such as the nature of the materials (stainless steel, plastic, paper,...), the medium (liquid media, aerosol, porous and non-porous surfaces), temperature and relative humidity (expressed in range and or median value), pH (if available) etc. Other information was also indicated for each kinetics such as the initial virus load, the type of cell used for infectious viral titration (Vero, etc.) or the number of experimental replicates. Table 2 provides an overview of the extracted kinetics from SARS-CoV-2 studies, the Table 3 from studies for other coronaviruses.
Data extraction. The persistence kinetics data were taken from texts, tables or figures in the research papers identified above. Data from tables or texts were manually filled into the database. Raw data from figures were extracted using the R package metadigitize78. This tool provided the possibility to process simultaneously many figures, as well as reproducibility (e.g., correcting the digitalized data, sharing digitalization). For reproducibility purposes, all files associated with raw digitalizations of our study are provided and detailed in the Data records section. The monitored time points extracted from all studies (extractions from tables or figures digitalization) were converted and expressed in hours in order to homogenize for comparative purposes between studies.
Viral infectivity reduction parameter. The third step aimed to estimate a parameter to characterize the viral infectivity reduction for each kinetics (condition). This parameter, denoted D and expressed in hour, characterized the decimal log reduction time and was estimated by fitting a primary inactivation model on the extracted data79. The value of D corresponding to the inverse of the slope from a linear model10,71 was written as follows:

its uncertainty expressed by standard error value SE. The value of log10 D was computed accordingly for each kinetics. Finally, the coefficient of variation was calculated as the proportion: CV=SE/D.
Evaluation of kinetics quality. In this work, kinetics data were collected from different publications in which the laboratory experiments were not conducted with the same design. These data represented then important variabilities, e.g. in terms of number of time points, replicates, etc. Therefore, criteria can be useful to evaluate and classify the quality of the collected kinetics. Indeed, the quality of raw data was susceptible to influence the statistical estimation of D. Criteria-based ranking approaches have been proposed in some predictive microbiology studies aiming to deal with difficulties in terms of data selection (inclusion or exclusion for modelling)83,84. Herein, for the establishment of a quality score by kinetics, we considered three criteria: (i) the number of the time points of the kinetics; (ii) the importance of the extracted point considering if it represented a single value or multiple measure (i.e. at least two technical replicates); and (iii) the value of the coefficient of variation (CV) of the estimated value of D, characterizing the fit quality of the inactivation model. For each kinetics, we attributed three scores corresponding to these three criteria and classified them into different categories. It is worth noting that ones can arbitrarily define the threshold values separating these categories as well as the given corresponding score values depending on the studies and the extracted dataset. In our work, for each kinetics, the score associated with the number of time points, denoted s1, was firstly defined as follows:
 1(nt  3) , s = 2(4  nt < 6) , 1 3(6  nt < 8) ,
 4(nt  8) ,
where nt corresponds to the number of time points collected from the kinetics. The score s2, based on the importance of points (`unique' or `multiple'), was defined as follows:
s =  1(unique) , 2 3(multiple) .
The score s3, based on the coefficient of variation CVi of the kinetics i, was given as follows:
 1(CV > 0.3) , s = 2(0.2  CV < 0.3) , 3 3(0.1  CV < 0.2) ,
 4(CV < 0.1) ;
or s3 = 1 for some kinetics for which standard errors and coefficients of variation could not be computed (kinetics with only two points).
Finally, a global score S taking into account all criteria was calculated for each kinetics:
S = s1 × s2 + s3.
The calculated scores for all kinetics are gathered in Spreadsheets and R Data objects provided in the Data Records section.
Data Records Intermediate data: Figure digitalization raw files. The digitalized source figures (jpg or png image
files) were used in the second step of the collection procedure (see Fig. 1). The digitalization were carried using the R package metaDigitise78 that automatically created the directory denoted `caldat' containing raw digitalization files to assure traceability and also to avoid re-doing manual digitalization at every run of the procedure. Raw digitalization files generated by metaDigitise were automatically renamed like their corresponding image files. All sources figures and digitalization raw files used herein are provided in a data repository85.
Input and output quantitative data spreadsheet. Output spreadsheets were obtained at the end of the overall collection procedure under the Excel and CSV file formats (see Fig. 1) ("DataRecord_OutputData.xlsx" and "DataRecord_OutputData.csv").
All information reported from publications (experimental conditions, figure sources, publication references, DOI, etc.) related to each kinetics used as input, as well as the corresponding estimated values as described in the Method section (D, coefficient de variation, scores, etc.) are present85. Each row represents a kinetics, each column is completed, when available, by qualitative and quantitative variables, as follows:
· ID of each kinetics (Kinetics key), denoted for example: `K001', `K002', etc.; · ID of each study (Study key); · Studied viruses and their classification: Genus, Sub-genus, Virus, Strain; · Temperature considered in the experimental design: temperatures were gathered by precise values reported

Technical Validation
The technical validation focused on the figures' digitalization step, since the latter remained a manual work that could probably vary from one user to another. In order to check the quality of the data collected by digitalization, this step was re-conducted repeatedly by three independent users for evaluating its repeatability and its reproducibility. This checking procedure was performed on a random sample of eleven kinetics among those collected, and each kinetics was digitalized three times per user. The values of the parameter D were afterwards estimated as described in previous sections. The comparison between the values of D estimated by different users was firstly done by fitting the major axis regression model on bootstrap data generated for each pair of users86,87. Afterwards, the Gage R&R tool from the R package SixSigma88,89 was used in order to identify and quantify the error parts in the estimated values of log_10 D due to the user repeatability as well as the between user reproducibility, respectively. The R scripts and data associated with the technical validation procedure are provided (see the `Code Availability' section below).
As illustration, the comparison between users (denoted user 1, 2 and 3, respectively) by major axis regression is plotted in Fig. 3 (user 1, plotted in the X-axis, was arbitrarily chosen herein as the reference one for comparison). The results of the Gage R&R analysis showed a good repeatability: the latter estimated a very low error part due to intra-user variation, estimated at only 0.01% of the overall variation. The error part due to the between-users variation was estimated at 1.5%. After confrontation between experimenters, this part of inter-users error can be explained by the difficulties for choosing the points to be digitalized. Indeed points below the limit of quantification (LOQ) should not be included for avoiding bias. This choice could then strongly influence the estimation of log10 D as illustrated in Fig. 3, since this parameter conditioned the slope of the

linear model fitted to the chosen data points. Yet, in many articles, the information LOQ is not provided. In such conditions, it is up to scientist in charge of digitalization to include/exclude points to be included. This is prone to introduce uncertainty especially for points corresponding to the end of the experiment. In view of this user-dependent choice, in the present study, we provided then all raw digitalization files that be imported, re-used or modified by other users if needed according to their expertise.
Usage Notes Re-use of figure digitalization files. The digitalization step were done using the R package metaDigitise78 pro-
viding reproducible and flexible tools for tracing every digitalization. In practice, the digitalizations were done using R commands (check the R scripts provided in the Code Availability section) allowing users to process the different image files ready-to-digitalize. This process consisted, for each image (plot), to click manually on the different chosen points of the image to calibrate the plotted axes and convert afterwards the different clicked points (from curves, barplots, etc.) to numerical values saved in R object. The different groups of points can be assigned with user-defined group names in order to separate different kinetics from the same image if necessary. For each digitalized image, a digitalization file is automatically generated in a specific directory, denoted `caldat' to ensure the traceability of this manual step. Indeed, such a file can give the possibility, using R commands, to import the numerical values already digitalized and/ or edit/recalibrate some values/points by other users if needed without having to re-process the whole image .
