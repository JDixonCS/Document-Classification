As soon as the first case of the omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was reported in November 2021, it quickly spread worldwide with the emergence of several subvariants. Compared to previous variants, omicron was heavily mutated, especially for those in the Spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain. These mutations allowed the viruses to evade immune responses (i.e., previous infections and vaccine-elicited) and increase in transmissibility. Although vaccine effectiveness is decreased for omicron, boosters remain effective for protecting against severe diseases. Also, bivalent vaccines have been developed to increase vaccine effectiveness. Interestingly, although omicron is highly infectious, it has less morbidity and mortality compared to previously identified variants, such as delta. Additionally, the mutations that allow the virus to evade immune responses also allow it to evade many of the monoclonal antibodies developed at the beginning of the pandemic for treatment. Here, we reviewed the omicron variant's epidemiology, genetics, transmissibility, disease severity, and responsiveness to vaccine and treatments.

INTRODUCTION
After the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, it has spread worldwide, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Unlike other RNA viruses, coronaviruses have a proofreading mechanism leading to fewer mutations than oth-

er RNA viruses, but the SARS-CoV-2 virus has mutated to form a number of variants. These variants have evolved to escape from neutralizing antibodies by changing the Spike (S) protein sequence and structure. The emergence of these variants has led to repeated waves worldwide, and changed the pathogenesis of the infection and the efficacy of vaccines.
The WHO Virus Evolution Working Group suggested using letters of the Greek alphabet for naming each major variant of SARS-CoV-2, classified as a variant of concern (VOC). As of November 2021, there have been four VOCs (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta), which was reviewed in our previous study.1 In late 2021, a new VOC was identified and named "omicron." In the present study, we discuss this new VOC, which has now replaced all other variants worldwide.
EMERGENCE OF OMICRON
On November 24, 2021, South Africa reported the first case of B.1.1.529 variant from a specimen collected on November 9,

2021. After the week of the first detection, cases with this new variant increased dramatically. Given the spike in cases, the WHO designated the B.1.1.529 variant as a VOC.2 By December 15, 2021, the variant had spread to 80 countries. Then, by January 6, 2022, the number of countries reporting the presence of this VOC had increased to 149, and the variant soon became the predominant cause of COVID-19 worldwide.3
Since the original identification of the omicron variant, several subvariants have emerged. The first reported subvariants were BA.1 and BA.1.1, and then BA.2 and BA.3 were also reported in South Africa around the same period (Fig. 1). Additionally, BA.4 and BA.5. subvariants were identified on April 4, 2022; and on May 22, 2022, BA.2.75 was also designated by the WHO.3

MUTATIONAL PATTERNS
Genetic analysis of the omicron VOC has suggested that omicron evolved either from the alpha VOC or a new monophyletic clade, depending on the evolutionary substitution model method.4 However, more than 50 mutations were found to be different between omicron and its ancestral strain. Thirty of these mutations were in the S protein and 15 were mutated sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Such extensive mutation in the S protein pointed to likely immune evasion, likely antibody, which explains its increased infectiousness and breakthrough infections compared to other SARS-CoV-2 variants.5 Table 1 presents the summary of mutational differences across VOC and sublineages of omicron. Interestingly, a 69-70 dele-

tion in the S gene of omicron caused a "S gene target failure (SGTF)," which was only present in the alpha variants previously. This meant that the virus was not detectable by standard PCR test in one of the three target genes of the S protein, leading to a false negative molecular test.8,9 Thus, when two out of three target genes were positive on a qRT-PCR test, it was a way to identify that the person was likely infected with the omicron variant rather than the delta variant, which was also circulating at the time.
As omicron has continued to spread around the world, its sublineages have been identified. Comparing BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 mutations, there are 21 mutations that are commonly shared. BA.1.1 and BA.3 each have one unique mutation. BA.2 has eight unique mutations.10 BA.4, BA.5, and BA.2.75 are close to BA.2, and compared to BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5 have deletions of residues 69 and 70 in the N-terminal domain and lack the Q493R and additional mutations at L452R, and F486V in the RBD.11 BA.2.75 has nine more mutations compared to BA.2.12 This progressive evolution likely points to further immune evasion from pre-existing immune responses in populations, likely also impacting infectiousness of the virus. Table 1 shows the estimated reproductive numbers for each VOC and subvariant of omicron.
PATHOGENICITY
Interestingly, shortly after omicron was first identified, it was found that people infected with it seemed to have less severe symptoms compared to people infected with previous VOC.13 A multicenter, nationwide retrospective cohort study based on the US Electronic Health Record data from December 2021 until January 2022 showed significantly less severe outcomes with omicron infection than with the delta variant. The study matched the omicron cohort with the delta cohort for demographics that included the socioeconomic determinants of health, comorbidities, COVID-19-related medications, and vaccination status. The data showed that the omicron cohort's 3-day risk of hospitalization from SARS-CoV-2 infection, emergency room visit, intensive care unit admission, and use of mechanical ventilation were significantly lower than those of previous variants.14 A national cohort from Scotland also showed that COVID-19 hospitalization decreased in the S-gene-negative group (compared to the S-gene-positive group) after adjusting confounders.15
Although the reason for this decreased pathogenicity of omicron is not fully clear, a number of studies have offered some clues. One in vitro study from Hong Kong found that the omicron variant replication was lower and had weak fusion activity in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells compared to delta variants, indicating that the omicron variant is less dependent on the TMPRSS2 pathway.16 Furthermore, Hui, et al.17 compared the replication competency and tropism of original strain with delta and

B.1.1.529/omicron variants in ex vivo explant cultures of the human bronchi and lung parenchyma, and found that the omicron variant showed higher replication competence in the human bronchi explant cultures ex vivo, but had lower human lung explant cultures ex vivo compared to the delta variant and original strain. Another study showed that the replication capacity of omicron variant was similar with delta isolates in human nasal epithelial cultures; however, in lung cells and gut cells, omicron showed lower replication.18 Omicron S protein was less efficiently cleaved compared to the delta variant. Also, the entry of omicron variant to specific cell types was affected by the cellular RNA expression of TMPRSS2. The less formation of multinuclear syncytia in cell lines demonstrated another reason for less virulence of omicron variant.19 Additionally, while multiple mutations on the S protein of omicron enable escape from antibodies, T-cell immune responses are still present and likely to lessen disease severity.20
Studies comparing the pathogenicity of subvariants have been enlightening. One study compared the omicron subvariants BA.5, BA.1, BA.2, and original B.1.1 in vitro and in vivo. In the airway-on-a-chip study, BA.5 showed more destruction and higher viral load in the blood compared to the other subvariants. Also, BA.5 that infected the hamsters' lung tissues had
https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2022.0383

a higher histopathological score, larger area of type II pneumocytes, and increased inflammatory responses (i.e., CXCL10, IL6, ISG15, and MX-1) compared to infection by other subvariants. Taken together, these data suggest that BA.5 subvariant is likely more pathogenic than other omicron subvariants.21
TRANSMISSIBILITY
Increased transmissibility is a main characteristic of the omicron variant, and is also the reason why it is the predominant variant present around the world. During the last week of December 2021, the total number of new SARS-CoV-2 cases reported worldwide was 9.5 million, which was 71% more than the previous week, and the omicron subvariant accounted for the largest proportion of cases by the first week of January 2022 in many countries.22 The doubling times were estimated as 3.3 days in the South African province of Gauteng, and even shorter doubling times were reported in many countries such as Australia (3.0 days), New York State (2.5 days), the UK (2.4 days), and Denmark (2.0 days).23 The meta-analysis of effective and basic reproduction numbers (Re and R0) for omicron showed that the average effective reproduction number (Re) was 3.4 (a range from

SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant of Concern

0.88 to 9.4, IQR: 2.03, 3.85), and the basic reproduction number was 9.5 (a range from 5.5 to 24, IQR: 7.25, 11.88) (Table 1).24
There are several mutations known to contribute to an increase in transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, including the combination of N501Y, Q493R, Q498R, T478K, and Y505H mutations at receptor binding motif, which increases the binding affinity with the ACE2 receptor, enabling the virus to easily infect target cells. Interestingly, the G496S mutation of BA.1 is known to have the highest affinity.10 Additionally, Hui, et al.17 also found that the omicron replicated significantly faster than the original strain or delta variant in the human bronchi, which may suggest higher infectious virus load in the airways. Of course, being able to infect people who were previously infected or have been vaccinated, or both would also likely increase the transmissibility of omicron compared to other variants.
PRE-EXISTING IMMUNE RESPONSE FROM PRIOR INFECTIONS AND VACCINATION
Currently, most people around the world have pre-existing immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 either from vaccination or prior infection, or both.25,26 This level of pre-existing immune responses impacts the overall spread of SARS-CoV-2, and the evolution of the virus to produce variants is based on the evasion of these immune responses. Since the RBD is most targeted for the immune system, mutations in these sites are considered to influence the ability of antibodies to neutralize the virus. One study found that convalescent patients' serum and vaccine serum neutralization activities against omicron were lowered compared to the original strain and other variants.27 In addition, a study compared each omicron subvariants' neutralizing antibody titers in people who had been boosted with an mRNA vaccine, and found that titers of neutralizing antibody were different for each subvariant. Specifically, compared to the BA.1 subvariant, BA.2.12.1 and BA.4 or BA.5 were lower by the factor of 1.5 and 2.9, respectively.28 Another study showed that BA.4 and BA.5 were more resistant to neutralization by boosted vaccine than BA.1, and BA.2.11
One meta-analysis study showed that after stratification by predominant strain, an increased reinfection rate of omicron variant was observed. During the first 3 months of the omicron wave, the reinfection rate was 3.31% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-6.53] compared to 0.57% (95% CI: 0.28-0.94) on the alpha wave and 1.25% (95% CI: 0.97-1.55) on the delta wave.29 These results showed that the pre-existing immunity from prior infection might have less protective effect on the omicron variant.
Data on vaccine effectiveness against omicron showed benefits of a booster vaccination. A large, matched case-control study was conducted during the BA.1.1.59 omicron surge in Israel comparing individuals who took the booster shot of BNT152b2
980

mRNA vaccine with controls who had not. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be 93% (95% CI: 88-97) for admission to hospital, 92% (95% CI: 82-97) for severe disease, and 81% (95% CI: 59-97) for COVID-19-related death.30 Another study from Qatar evaluated the effectiveness for each vaccination, previous Infection, and hybrid immunity against BA.1 and BA.2. It found that previous infection, booster of vaccination, and hybrid immunity offered protection from both BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants in terms of severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19.31 Now, more countries are offering second booster vaccines for higher risk populations. For example, in Israel, a fourth dose of BNT162b2 vaccine began in January 2022 when the B.1.1.529 variant was predominant. During this period, the team compared people who received four doses of vaccine with people who had received only three doses, and found that the people who received four doses had greater protection against severe illness. They also observed a decrease in confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the short term, but the effectiveness on infection itself waned after 4 weeks.32
For this reason, the U.S. CDC recommends getting booster vaccinations.33 For certain adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and weighing 40 kg) who are moderate to severely immunocompromised and may have an inadequate immune response or unable to take COVID-19 vaccine, it is recommended to administer the vaccines as two consecutive intramuscular of tixagevimab 300 mg plus cilgavimab 300 mg injections for 6 months.34 In June 2022, Pfizer and Moderna each developed an omicron-adapted bivalent vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine (BNT162b2 OMI Combination BNT162b2) consisted of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and BA.1 subvariant spike mRNA, and the Moderna vaccine (mRNA-1273.214) consisted of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.1.529 omicron spike mRNA. Interim results showed that the bivalent vaccines were well-tolerated, and their neutralizing capacity against omicron was superior to the previously authorized mRNA vaccines.35,36
TREATMENT
Since the evolution of variants resulted from immune evasion, many antibody-based therapies that were developed early in the pandemic have been thwarted by omicron. A modeling study of monotherapy or combination therapy, which proved to be effective in previous variants, showed that omicron subvariants can escape the antibodies (Table 2).37 Casirivimab, imdevimab cocktail and bamlanivimab, etesevimab cocktail both failed to neutralize omicron subvariants.11 Several studies were conducted to compare each antibody's efficacy between each subvariants including BA.2.75. Interestingly, the tendency of potency against each subvariant was different according to the monoclonal antibody. Sotrovimab was active against B.1 and B1.1 but substantially decreased against the BA.2, BA.4/5, and BA.2.75. subvariants. Bebtelovimab retained neu-

tralization activity against all circulating omicron subvariants, which is why it became the only monoclonal antibody that can be used as an alternative therapy for non-hospitalized adults with omicron.38,39 For cilgavimab, potency against BA.5 and BA.2.75 reduced by approximately 13-fold compared to BA.2. On the other hand, tixagevimab had enough potency against BA.2.75, but it failed to neutralize BA.2 and BA.5.40,41 Based on these data, among five of the monoclonal antibody agents that were first approved or issued emergency use authorization (EUA), three of them withdrew authorization.37 Fortunately, non-antibody-based antiviral therapies for COVID-19 in nonhospitalized patients using direct-acting antiviral inhibitors that target viral proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or proteases, are still effective against omicron subvariants. In particular, one study that assessed the in vitro antiviral effect of remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir showed that the EC50 (50% effective concentration) was not significantly decreased compared to other variants.42
SUMMARY
Despite the widespread containment efforts and strategies, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to become more infectious, leading experts to become skeptical about the end of the pandemic. Among all VOCs, omicron is the most mutated type of variant and has unfortunately made the virus more infectious, though less pathogenic. However, who knows what the next variant will bring? We assume that the next VOC will be more infectious than the current one, only because that is how variants become VOC. However, as pathogenicity is more difficult to predict, persistent monitoring and early detection will be required.

Abstract
Objectives: To evaluate factors associated with COVID-19 severity outcomes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data of a prospective, multi-stage cohort study--"The ReumaCoV Brazil"--designed to monitor patients with immune-mediated rheumatologic disease (IMRD) during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. SLE adult patients with COVID-19 were compared with those without COVID-19. SLE activity was evaluated by the patient global assessment (PGA) and SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K). Results: 604 SLE patients were included, 317 (52.4%) with COVID-19 and 287 (47.6%) in the control group. SLE COVID19 patients reported a lower frequency of social isolation and worked more frequently as health professionals. There was

no difference in the mean SLEDAI-2K score between groups in the post-COVID-19 period (5.8 [8.6] vs. 4.5 [8.0]; p = 0.190). However, infected patients reported increased SLE activity according to the Patient Global Assessment (PGA) during this period (2.9 [2.9] vs. 2.3 [2.6]; p = 0.031. Arterial hypertension (OR 2.48 [CI 95% 1.04-5.91], p = 0.041), cyclophosphamide (OR 14.32 [CI 95% 2.12-96.77], p = 0.006), dyspnea (OR: 7.10 [CI 95% 3.10-16.23], p < 0.001) and discontinuation of SLE treatment medication during infection (5.38 [CI 95% 1.97-15.48], p = 0.002), were independently associated with a higher chance of hospitalization related to COVID-19. Patients who received telemedicine support presented a 67% lower chance of hospitalization (OR 0.33 [CI 95% 0.12-0.88], p = 0.02). Conclusion: Hypertension and cyclophosphamide were associated with a severe outcome, and telemedicine can be a useful tool for SLE patients with COVID-19.

Introduction
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, immune-mediated rheumatologic disease (IMRD), with a two to five-fold higher mortality rate than the general population1,2 and with infectious complications being responsible for 25%-50% of deaths.3 The higher risk of infection can be explained by impairment of the immune system, which is inherent to the disease, due to glucocorticoid and immunosuppressant use, and accumulated damage.3,4 Infections are predominantly bacterial in origin in the community, but there is also an increased risk of fungal, viral, and mycobacterial infections.5-7
Since the first cases were described, severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a pandemic, reaching more than 200 countries. Conditions such as systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease have been identified as the main risk factors for infection and worse outcomes.8 Initial studies suggested that autoimmune diseases are not risk factors for COVID-19.8,9 However, a systematic review published in 2020 reported a higher prevalence of the disease in IMRD, but not in the subgroup of SLE patients.10 A recent study reported a worse COVID-19 prognosis in IMRD patients, with higher intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality rates.11 The first evaluation of the ReumaCoV-Brazil Registry with 334 IMRD participants

showed that being diagnosed with SLE was considered a possible protective factor for ICU treatment.12
To date, few studies have described the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection specifically in SLE patients.9-11,13 In addition to questions regarding the incidence of COVID-19 and outcomes in SLE patients, it is not known whether the infection could induce a disease flare. Both COVID-19 and active SLE can present with cytopenia, arthralgia, myocarditis, interstitial pneumonia, and hemophagocytic syndrome, blurring the distinction between them and making it difficult to define the best therapeutic approach.14,15
The main objective of the present study was to evaluate factors associated with COVID-19 severity outcomes in patients with SLE. Additionally, the study evaluated whether SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with worse SLE activity compared with the group of SLE patients without infection.
Patients and methods
Study design. This was a cross-sectional study in which patients with SLE (according to the American College of Rheumatology 1997 or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus International Collaborating Clinics 2012 criteria), aged over 18 years, with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were compared to those without COVID-19 included in the ReumaCoV-Brazil Registry.16,17 ReumaCoV-Brazil is an observational multicenter and prospective cohort still ongoing and includes 43 centers from the five regions of Brazil; its main objective is to monitor adult IMRDs patients with and without a diagnosis of COVID-19. The detailed methodology of the registry has been previously published.18
Eligible patients were selected through telephone contact, at outpatient clinics, or during hospitalization related to COVID-19. Patients with a present or previous diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were classified as

cases. From this total sample, 604 patients with SLE were evaluated: 317 SLE patients with COVID-19 (Group 1) and 287 SLE patients without COVID-19 (Group 2). All patients read and signed the informed consent form before inclusion.18

Patients were diagnosed with mild COVID-19 if they required only outpatient care or emergency room care for less than 24 h; moderate in cases of hospital admission; and severe if the patient required intensive care unit care, invasive mechanical ventilation, or in case of death.

Data assessment. Data were collected from the Research Electronic Data Capture platform (RedCap, https://www. project-redcap.org/).
Patients on the registry are assessed at three time points
Visit 1: Baseline. Due to local health recommendations related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the variables collected for before COVID-19 were as described in the medical record at the last presential visit, considering 6 months prior to the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Information related to the post-COVID-19 period was collected at the first face-to-face visit 4-6 weeks after the infection. Visit 2: 3 months after inclusion (±15 days); Visit 3: 6 months after inclusion (±15 days).
This study analyzed the data from the first visit of the registry. Demographic data, such as age, sex, work status, and social isolation during the pandemic, as well as data on comorbidities (https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/icdonlineversions/en/), clinical presentations, and SLE treatment were collected. Glomerular filtration rates lower than 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 were considered a comorbidity due to kidney disease.19 Patients were asked whether they had received telemedicine care during COVID-19 infection, for monitoring and treatment of symptoms, or for guidance on warning sings.
Disease activity was assessed through patient global assessment (PGA)20,21 and the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K).22 The PGA analysis was based on a visual numeric scale (0-10), with 0 indicating no perception of disease activity and 10, perception of intense activity.
COVID-19 characteristics and outcomes
COVID-19 case definition. - Patients with an acute respiratory condition characterized by at least two of the following signs and symptoms: fever, dyspnea, cough, sore throat, headache, coryza, olfactory or taste disorders, and/or a detectable SARS-CoV-2 result by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or a reagent result for immunoglobulin (IgM, IgA, and/or IgG).
- Patients with an acute respiratory condition and close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 within 14 days prior to the onset of signs and symptoms.

Control group
Patients with SLE, included in The ReumaCoV-Brazil Registry, without current or previous known COVID-19 infection. Statistical analysis. Initially, the study analyzed absolute and relative frequencies of categorical variables as mean (standard deviation), and of numerical variables as median (minimum-maximum values). The normality distribution of numerical variables was analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Associations between two categorical variables were verified using the chi-square or Fisher's exact tests.
Comparisons of means between two groups were performed using the Student's t-test for independent samples. Comparisons of means between more than two groups were performed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test, according to normality of the variables. Dunn-Bonferroni tests were used to locate differences in the means.
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were adjusted to evaluate simultaneous effects of demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics of the patients with SLE and COVID-19 (predictor variables) on the hospitalization outcome (dependent variable). Variables showing associations with the dependent variable that were significant at 10% in the univariate logistic regression were selected for the multivariate models. Variables that were not significant at 5% were then excluded by order of significance (backward method). The goodness of fit of the final model was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. A significance level of 5% was used for all statistical tests. Data were exported to SPSS statistical software (IBM® SPSS 20.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
In total, 604 patients with SLE were included, 91.6% female with a mean age of 39.7 (12.3) years. In this sample, 226 (37.7%) patients had at least one comorbidity and 160 (26.7%) presented two or more. Regarding medications, 332 (55.0%) patients were using glucocorticoids, 13 (2.15%) methylprednisolone pulse therapy, 514 (85.1%) hydroxychloroquine, and 328 (54.3%) immunosuppressive treatment, including azathioprine (141 [23.3%]), mycophenolate mofetil (105 [17.4%]), methotrexate (58 [9.6%]), and cyclophosphamide pulse therapy in the last 6 months (18 [3.0%]). Nineteen (3.1%) patients were being treated with belimumab and 14 (2.3%) with rituximab (Table 1).

There were no differences between groups regarding age, sex, disease activity before SARS-CoV-2 infection, and comorbidities (Table 1)
SLE patients with COVID-19 reported a lower frequency of social isolation (49.5% vs. 61.9%; p = 0.002), worked more frequently as health care professionals (10.4% vs 3.5%; p = 0.002), and had a higher frequency of joint (32.5% vs. 22.0%; p = 0.004) and hematologic (18.0% vs. 11.5%; p = 0.025) manifestations.
Group 1 patients reported feeling increased SLE activity after resolution of COVID-19 symptoms (PGA: 2.9 [2.9] vs. 2.3 [2.6]; p = 0.031). However, there was no difference in the mean SLEDAI-2K score between groups in the post- COVID-19 period (5.8 [8.6] vs. 4.5 [8.0]; p = 0.190).
In group 1, 51.1% reported contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, mainly at home (70%). Only 5% of the patients remained asymptomatic during the infectious period. The most frequent symptoms were headache (58.4%), asthenia (51.7%), and cough (50.5%) (Table 2).
Regarding COVID-19 severity classification, 251 (79.1%) patients were categorized as mild and 66 (20.8%) as moderate to severe. Among 66 patients who were hospitalized, 34.8% required intensive care unit treatment and 28.7% needed invasive mechanical ventilation. Fourteen (21.2%) patients died from COVID-19 complications. The estimated overall deaths attributable to COVID-19, out of the total of 604 SLE patients, were 2.3% (CI 95% 1.3-3.9).
From 59 patients who presented chest computed tomography images, 43 (74%) presented an exam with relevant abnormalities. The main changes were ground-glass opacity with lung parenchyma involvement <50% in 46.5% of the patients, followed by ground-glass opacity with lung parenchyma involvement >50% in 32.6%, and consolidations in 14% of the patients.
In the univariate logistic regression analysis, male sex, older age, the presence of two or more comorbidities, prednisone dose  20 mg/day, and methylprednisolone or cyclophosphamide pulse therapy were associated with hospital admission due to COVID-19. On the contrary,

patients who received telemedicine orientation during SARS-CoV-2 infection presented a lower chance of hospitalization (Table 3).
There was no difference in the mean post-COVID-19 SLEDAI-2K score between patients who required and who did not require hospitalization, either in the hospital (4.8 [7.0] vs. 5.9 [8.8], p = 0.998) or in the intensive care unit (3.7 [3.7] vs. 5.9 [8.7], p = 0.936).
Cyclophosphamide pulse therapy (OR: 14.32 [2.12- 96.77], p = 0.006), progressing with dyspnea during the infectious episode (OR: 7.10 [3.10-16.23], p < 0.001), and a history of systemic arterial hypertension (OR: 2.48 [1.04- 5.91], p = 0.041) were independently associated with a greater chance of hospital admission related to COVID-19 (Table 4). Eighty-seven patients who were attended by telemedicine presented a 67% lower chance of hospitalization compared to patients who did not receive this modality of medical evaluation (OR: 0.33 [0.12-0.88], p = 0.02). The chance of hospitalization was 5.4 times higher in the 32 (10.1%) patients whose SLE treatment medication was discontinued during their SARS-CoV-2 infection; including mycophenolate mofetil, suspended in 11 patients, azathioprine in 10 patients, methotrexate in 10 patients, hydroxychloroquine in 5 patients, cyclophosphamide pulse therapy in 3 patients, and oral corticosteroids in 2 patients.
Discussion
SLE patients with COVID-19 reported lower adherence to social distancing and presented a higher frequency of being health care professionals. In addition, patients self-reported more severe disease activity in the period after infectious symptom resolution than the control group, although no difference was observed in SLEDAI-2K. Patients with dyspnea, a history of hypertension, recent treatment with cyclophosphamide and whose SLE treatment medication was discontinued presented worse outcomes regarding COVID-19 severity, demonstrated by a higher frequency of hospital admission.

Social distancing is considered one of the main measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population.23 To date, there are questions about the role of this sanitary measure associated with other risk factors for viral infection, such as degree of immunosuppression, disease activity, and COVID-19 treatment in patients with IMRDs.
In this cohort, SLE patients with COVID-19 had greater exposure to the virus, but there was no difference in disease activity or immunosuppressive treatment compared with the control group. It is notable that 51.1% of patients with COVID-19 reported contact with a confirmed case, with 70% having occurred at home. Similar results were observed by Ramirez et al.23 in a study of 417 patients with SLE, 14 with a diagnosis of COVID-19, among whom the inadequate preventive behavior of family members was associated with a greater chance of infection. These preliminary data suggest that measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with

SLE are not different to those recommended for the general population, which include prioritizing the education of patients and family members regarding social distancing, isolation of symptomatic patients, and the use of masks.24
Patients with active SLE have a higher risk for infectious complications, which are a trigger for disease activity.6 However, few studies have evaluated disease activity in patients with SLE after or during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, SLEDAI-2K was similar between the groups before and after the infectious period; however, the patients with COVID-19 reported a perception of more frequent worsening of SLE activity. In view of these divergent results, two points should be discussed. In the general population, approximately 50%-90% of patients progress with persistent post-acute COVID-19 symptoms, some of which are similar to those reported in several IMRDs.25 The most frequent symptoms were fatigue

(53.1%), dyspnea (43.4%), joint pain (27.3%), and chest pain (21.7%).26 COVID-19 also progressed with declined functional capacity in 44% of the patients.26 Persistent
COVID-19 symptoms possibly interfered in the self-
assessment of patients, either by presenting symptoms
similar to those of disease activity or by interfering in their
quality of life and, consequently, in their perception of well-
being. Another point to consider is the fact that SLEDAI-2k
is a global score and frequently underestimates some potentially severe SLE presentations.25

COVID-19 symptoms in SLE patients were similar
to those reported in the general population, except for
the lower frequency of fever (46.6% vs. 88.5%) and higher frequency of headache (58.4% vs. 12.1%).1 In a
Spanish study, 60% of patients with SLE and COVID-
19 presented fever, corroborating the results of the present study.13 The lower frequency of fever in this
context can be explained by thermoregulation changes
related to glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive treatment.4

Severe COVID-19 outcomes, such as hospital admission (20.8%), intensive care unit treatment (28.7%), invasive mechanical ventilation (20.8%), and overall mortality (2.3%), were also similar to those reported in the general population.14,27 It is difficult to compare studies evaluating SLE and COVID-19 because these studies are heterogeneous regarding the methodology and characteristics of the study population, especially concerning the disease severity and types of immunosuppressive treatments.28 In the French registry, which compared patients hospitalized with SLE with and without COVID-19, the inpatient mortality rate was 9.5% in the group with COVID-19, four-fold higher than the inpatient mortality of SLE patients hospitalized for other causes.28
In another study, the hospitalization rate was 82%, with 7% in the intensive care unit, and the mortality rate was 14%, with higher rates than those found in the present study. The factors that may possibly explain the different frequencies of severity outcomes of COVID-19 are glucocorticoid doses, number of comorbidities, immunosuppressants, and issues related to infrastructure and access to health.11,12
Cyclophosphamide treatment in patients with SLE is associated with an increased risk of bacterial and nonbacterial infection, impacting the disease morbidity and mortality.29 In the present study, cyclophosphamide significantly increased hospital admission among patients with COVID-19. Poor control of viral infection by the immune system is one of the main factors contributing to COVID-19 severity, as demonstrated by the association between high viral replication and immune dysregulation.30 Cyclophosphamide is a cytotoxic alkylating medication that interferes with lymphocyte proliferation, reducing the production of effector and cytotoxic T cells, as well as autoantibody production.31 The response of cytotoxic T lymphocytes is crucial for viral eradication in COVID-19. Patients with severe forms of COVID-19 present with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and the depletion of almost all T-cell subtypes.30 SARS-CoV-2 infection presents with clonal expansion of plasma cells, producing specific neutralizing antibodies due to multifaceted B-cell activation.30 Cyclophosphamide reduces antibody production, thus also interfering with the humoral response to the virus.31 The COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance also observed worse outcomes in patients with SLE and COVID-19 who were on cyclophosphamide treatment.32
The present study did not observe worse outcomes in patients treated with rituximab, as reported by some studies.32-34 This fact could be explained by the small number of patients in the study who were being treated with this medication. Data from the Global Rheumatology Alliance with 3729 patients with rheumatic disease and confirmed or presumptive COVID-19 demonstrated that the independent factors associated with COVID-19-related

death were age, male sex, hypertension combined with cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, and prednisolone-equivalent dosages of 10 mg/day. Moderateto-high disease activity (vs. remission/low disease activity) was associated with higher odds of death as were the use of rituximab, sulfasalazine, and immunosuppressants (e.g., azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin, mycophenolate, or tacrolimus), compared with methotrexate monotherapy.32 The nationwide study in Denmark report that the risk for hospitalization was three-fold higher in SLE patients than the general population, hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoid treatment was associated with hospitalization.35
Hypertension is considered a comorbidity associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes.8,36,37 An Italian study evaluated the death certificates of 4691 patients who died because of SARS-CoV-2 infection, showing that hypertension was the most reported comorbidity.38 The prevalence of hypertension in SLE ranges from 9.4% to 77% in several cohorts, depending on the definition used and age group of the studied population. Renal damage secondary to nephritis and glucocorticoid treatment are important causes of hypertension in SLE; however, other mechanisms have been described, such as generalized endothelial dysfunction. Recent studies have also reinforced the role of immune system dysregulation and chronic inflammation in the development and maintenance of hypertension.39 Increased serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interleukin-6, were shown to be associated with hypertension.39 Therefore, endothelial dysfunction and immune dysregulation caused by COVID-19 may further intensify the immune imbalance of hypertensive patients with SLE. Aggressive screening and low blood pressure level thresholds for antihypertensive treatment are usual recommendations for SLE patient care, which should be strongly emphasized in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.40
Discontinuation of SLE treatment during COVID-19 infection was associated with hospital admission. This outcome should be carefully analyzed, as the variable encompasses different medications with variable half-life and partial or complete discontinuation. The interference from treatment discontinuation in the immune response to infection could occur either through the reactivation of SLE or by unblocking the specific medication pathway with the release of inflammatory cytokines. Several anti-rheumatic drugs have been involved in the COVID-19 approach, such as tocilizumab in the management of severe forms, antiTNF showing a protective effect, and rituximab associated with a worse prognosis.41 There is much evidence of a nonprotective role of chronic hydroxychloroquine use concerning the severity of COVID-19 in patients with IMRDs.42 Large and longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the influence of both maintenance and

discontinuation of SLE treatment on the severity of COVID-19. Current evidence suggests that disease activity itself is a factor associated with a worse outcome in COVID19 and the discontinuation of immunosuppressive medications is not recommended, although glucocorticoids should always be used in the lowest possible dose.43 The Global Rheumatology Alliance analyses also demonstrated that individuals not receiving treatment for their SLE at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis had poorer outcomes, probably multifactorial, lack of access to SLE care or treatment, or poor adherence with medications.32
Telemedicine, a strategy that enables the prevision of medical services remotely and that ensures social distancing, increased exponentially during the pandemic.44,45 This tool can help in identifying early signs of severity and in avoiding unnecessary admissions in emergency services, when protocols and adequate health professional training are implemented.44 No study to date has evaluated the use of telemedicine in the clinical outcomes of COVID-19, but the use of telemedicine has been fundamental to control the spread of the disease in countries such as China, Australia, and the United States.44,46 In this study, patients using telemedicine required less frequent hospital care, thus reaffirming its protective effect on progression to severe outcomes in COVID-19. The study has positive points; it is multicenter, with a significant sample size and inclusion of a control group. The results are also representative because the sample included research centers from the five regions of the country.
The cross-sectional design is the main limitation, and the impossibility of performing the RT-PCR and/or the dosage of immunoglobulin (IgM, IgA, and/or IgG) in all patients with flu-like symptoms at the time of this analysis. Clinical and epidemiologic diagnostic criteria wore used because this is a real-life study and, at the time of inclusions, the availability to perform specific test for the diagnosis of COVID-10 was scare. The inclusion of participants in this study occurred between May and December 2020. At that time, Brazil was in an early phase of the epidemic, but with an increasing incidence and growing mortality rates, ranking fourth in the world for number of cases and sixth in absolute number of deaths In December 2020, there were 56,773 new cases in 24 h and more than 180,000 deaths from the disease.47 The local, social, demographic, and political characteristics must be taken into account to analyze the behavior of the epidemic in Brazil, since the country has a large population, distributed unevenly in the territory, with cultural and geographic differences showing marked social inequalities and access to health services, including access to tests for confirmation of the COVID-19 disease.48 The vaccination program only started in January 2021. One year after its beginning, 302.5 million doses were applied, representing 89.3% of the eligible Brazilian population

immunized with the 1st dose and 74.1% fully vaccinated.47
In conclusion, patients with SLE and COVID-19 engaged less in social isolation, presented more joint and hematological manifestations, used higher doses of prednisone at the moment of COVID-19 infection and reported severe disease activity after infectious by PGA. Cyclophosphamide pulse therapy and a history of hypertension were associated with a higher frequency of hospital admission related to COVID-19. Telemedicine was a useful strategy in these SLE patients. There are still many questions about the influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the progression of SLE patients, which can be better answered by longitudinal evaluations. It is also an important goal to characterize immunological deficiencies secondary to SLE, the medications used for SLE treatment, and its comorbidities, which may impair the efficiency of immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. These data reinforce that social isolation policies and care in corticosteroid dosage and judicious use of cyclophosphamide in the management of the disease are necessary.

Abstract
Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already caused 6 million deaths worldwide. While asymptomatic individuals are responsible of many potential transmissions, the difficulty to identify and isolate them at the high peak of infection constitutes still a real challenge. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 provokes severe vascular damage and thromboembolic events in critical COVID-19 patients, deriving in many related deaths and longhauler symptoms. Understanding how these processes are triggered as well as the potential long-term sequelae, even in asymptomatic individuals, becomes essential.
Methods: We have evaluated, by application of a proteomics-based quantitative approach, the effect of serum from COVID-19 asymptomatic individuals over circulating angiogenic cells (CACs). Healthy CACs were incubated ex-vivo with the serum of either COVID-19 negative (PCR -/IgG -, n:8) or COVID-19 positive asymptomatic donors, at differ ent infective stages: PCR+/IgG - (n:8) and PCR -/IgG+(n:8). Also, a label free quantitative approach was applied to identify and quantify protein differences between these serums. Finally, machine learning algorithms were applied to validate the differential protein patterns in CACs.
Results: Our results confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 promotes changes at the protein level in the serum of infected asymptomatic individuals, mainly correlated with altered coagulation and inflammatory processes (Fibrinogen, Von Willebrand Factor, Thrombospondin-1). At the cellular level, proteins like ICAM-1, TLR2 or Ezrin/Radixin were only upregulated in CACs treated with the serum of asymptomatic patients at the highest peak of infection (PCR+/IgG -), but not with the serum of PCR -/IgG+individuals. Several proteins stood out as significantly discriminating markers in CACs in response to PCR or IgG+serums. Many of these proteins particiArticle title: Kindly check and confirm the edit made in the articletitle.pate in the initial endothelial response against the virus.

Conclusions: The ex vivo incubation of CACs with the serum of asymptomatic COVID-19 donors at different stages of infection promoted protein changes representative of the endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory response after viral infection, together with activation of the coagulation process. The current approach constitutes an opti mal model to study the response of vascular cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and an alternative platform to test poten tial inhibitors targeting either the virus entry pathway or the immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) is the pathogen responsible of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), declared as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization. SARS-CoV-2 was identified for the first time in hospitalized patients with pneumonia in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, as an RNA virus of coronaviruses family (Zhu et al. 2020). Up to date (March 3, 2022), COVID19 has provoked 6 million deaths worldwide (www.covid 19.who.int), significantly affecting public health, the economics and society (Shipton et al. 2021; Bambra et al. 2020). Asymptomatic COVID-19 cases are responsible for many transmissions, which constitutes a real challenge to control the pandemic (Kronbichler et al. 2020). Approximately half of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals are symptomatic at the time of testing, as determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) (Alene et al. 2021; Ra et al. 2021). This makes their detection quite difficult, since most of these individuals don't seek testing and/or medical assistance and continue with their daily routine, contributing to rapid spread of COVID-19 (Gao et al. 2021). The identification of alternative markers (apart from physical symptoms or qPCR analysis) could significantly contribute to detect all potential SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Besides, little is known about the potential sequelae of SARS-Cov-2 over asymptomatic patients, and also how these initially "mild" infected people might become long-haulers at the long term (Huang et al. 2021).
Manifestations of COVID-19 are mostly respiratory; however, COVID-19 can also negatively affect extrapulmonary systems (Snell 2021), including the heart and systemic vasculature (Klok et al. 2020; Marone and Rinaldi 2020; Huang et al. 2020). Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been linked to cardiovascular alterations (arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease or cardiomyopathies), mainly associated to coagulation abnormalities and endothelial damage, leading to thrombosis (Alvarado-Moreno et al. 2021; Thachil et al. 2020). COVID19 enhances endothelial dysfunction, which not only involves oxidative stress, dysregulation of vascular tone or inflammatory response from the vascular wall (Jin

et al. 2020), but also promotes the mobilization and recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) (Alvarado-Moreno et al. 2021; Mancuso et al. 2020), key cells involved in vascular repair (Zhang et al. 2014). Remarkably, the levels of circulating EPCs are significantly increased in the blood of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (Mancuso et al. 2020; Guervilly et al. 2020), even three months after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Poyatos et al. 2021).
EPCs were first isolated from peripheral blood by Asahara et al., being defined as CD34+cells that could differentiate in vitro to endothelial cells (ECs) (Asahara et al. 1997). Currently, EPCs are classified in two main sub-populations: early EPCs, also known as circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) and late EPCs or endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs). CACs have a hematopoietic like phenotype and they exert their regenerative activity through paracrine mechanisms while ECFCs have an endothelial phenotype and can differentiate into mature ECs, participating directly in blood vessels formation (Hur et al. 2004; Medina et al. 2017). SARS-CoV-2 infection could negatively affect the repairing properties of EPCs, interfering with the normal functioning of the cardiovascular system. However, not many studies have been done on how EPCs behave in COVID-19 patients.
A better understanding of the initial stages in which SARS-CoV-2 affects the endothelium, even in asymptomatic individuals, becomes crucial in order to predict or prevent unwanted secondary effects, and the risk of suffering from severe complications. In the current study, we have evaluated, by application of a mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative approach, the proteomic changes taking place in healthy CACs in response to the differential factors present in the serum of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.
Methods
Study population The study was conducted in asymptomatic donors recruited at the National Paraplegic Hospital (SESCAM), Toledo, Spain during April-May 2020. They were all workers of this hospital. A graphical representation of

some characteristics registered for the study population is shown in Fig. 1A-C.
Serum sample collection and tests performed for COVID19 diagnostic Briefly, peripheral blood samples were collected using serum separator tubes (SSTTM II advance, BD ­Vacutainer®), centrifuged (4000 g, 10 min, 4 °C) and stored at - 80 °C.
A SARS-CoV-2 qPCR analysis from nasopharyngeal samples was performed to determine the positive or negative status of the donors. Also, an ELISA assay testing for specific IgG and IgM antibodies (IME00136 and IME00137; Erba Mannheim) was performed with the serum previously collected. With all this information, donors were classified into three different groups: healthy donors with negative qPCR and antibody's analysis test (Neg, n:29), asymptomatic patients with positive qPCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at blood extraction time (PCR+, n:8) and asymptomatic patients with positive IgG antibodies (IgG+, n:27) at the time of blood extraction (Fig. 1D).
CACs isolation and culture CACs were isolated from buffy coats from two healthy donors provided by the Andalusian Biobank Network (Decree 1/2013). Briefly, CACs were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cultured as previously described (Eslava-Alcon et al. 2020; Vega et al. 2017). PBMCs were isolated and plated in fibronectin coated plates (10 g/ml) and incubated in EBM-2 media plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Single Quots growth factors (Lonza). Non-adherent cells were discarded after four days and attached cells were allowed to grow in fresh media until day 7, when experimental assays were performed. CACs were characterized by flow cytometry assay, as described (Eslava-Alcon et al. 2020).
CACs incubation ex vivo with patients' serum CACs (aprox. 1 million cells per group) were washed several times with PBS 1X, to discard any remaining traces of FBS from the initial conditioned media, and then incubated 24 h (37 °C, 10% ­CO2) with EBM-2 medium containing 10% serum of the Neg (CACs+Neg), PCR+/IgG - (CACs+PCR) or PCR -/IgG+groups (CACs+IgG), n:8 per group (Fig. 1E). After that, cells were collected using Trypsin-EDTA 1X (X0930-100; Biowest), centrifuged and washed once with PBS 1X, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before their storage at -80 ºC.

Proteomic analysis A label free quantitative (LFQ) MS approach was applied in order to identify differential protein levels between serum samples of asymptomatic donors (Neg n:29; PCR+n:8; IgG+n:27). Also, the protein changes in CACs after the incubation with the different sets of serum samples (CACs+Neg, n:8; CACs+PCR, n:8; CACs+IgG, n:8) were analyzed following the same LFQ approach.
Serum samples (10 l) were supplemented with protease inhibitors (04693132001; Roche) and precipitated with acetone, over-night, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, 25 min and the pellet resuspended in 8 M urea. Similarly, the cell pellets were resuspended in 50 l of 8 M urea containing protease inhibitors (04693132001; Roche) for protein extraction and further proteomic analysis. For all samples, protein amount was quantified with the Qubit Fluorometric system (ThermoFisher Scientific) following manufacturer´s guidelines, and 50 µg of proteins in 8 M urea per sample were reduced (10 mM Dithiothreitol) and alkylated (50 mM Iodoacetamide). Samples were diluted four times with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and digested with Trypsin/LysC (V5073; Promega) (enzyme/substrate ratio 1:50) at 37 °C overnight. Finally, digestion was quenched with 0.1% TFA before peptide purification with C18 micro-columns, as described (Palmisano et al. 2010), and eluates were dried with a speed-vac system.
Liquid chromatography A nanoElute high pressure nanoflow system (Bruker Daltonics) was connected to the timsTOF Pro, an ion-mobility quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) that uses the parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF) acquisition method. Peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid (FA) up to a final concentration of 100 ng/l and 200 ng were delivered to a Thermo Trap Cartridge (5 mm) column, and a reverse phase analytical column (25 cm×75 um id IonOptics 25 cm, Thermo). Liquid chromatography was performed at 50ºC and peptides were separated on the analytical column using a 60 min gradient with buffers A (0.1% FA) and B (0.1% FA, Acetonitrile). For all samples, the TIMSTOF Pro instrument was operated in data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode.
Data processing Raw files were processed with MaxQuant (v 1.6.0.1), searching against a human protein database (Human UniProt) supplemented with contaminants. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines, oxidation of methionine and protein N-term acetylation were set as variable

modifications. Minimal peptide length was set to 7 amino acids and a maximum of two tryptic missed-cleavages were allowed. Results were filtered at 1% FDR (peptide and protein level) and only proteins with at least two peptides identified were considered for further analysis. LFQ was done with match between runs (match window of 0.7 min and alignment window of 20 min). Afterwards, the "proteinGroup.txt" file was loaded in Perseus (v1.6.0.2) for further statistical analysis.
Proteins were considered as differentially expressed between groups when p-value<0.05 and ratio>1.5 (upregulated) or ratio<0.6 (down-regulated). Data processing was done using Venny v2.1 (Venn's diagram), Perseus (hierarchical cluster), String (www.string-db.org), Enrichr (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr), Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen), Reactome (functional roles of proteins, www.reactome.org) and PINA v3 platform (protein interaction network analysis, www.omics.bjcan cer.org/pina).
Statistical analysis and machine learning Protein quantification and statistics were obtained using MaxQuant (Tyanova et al. 2016a) and Perseus 1.6.15.0 (Tyanova et al. 2016b) software. Reverse database hits and contaminants were removed before performing a Student's T-test analysis with a multiple hypothesis correction of p-values (1% FDR). Differences were considered statistically significant when p-value<0.05. Protein changes were confirmed with GraphPad Prism 9 software, and data were presented with box and plots graphs representing median, min and max value and showing all points. Also, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for differentially expressed proteins by plotting sensitivity (%) against 100%--specificity (%), indicating the area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence intervals.
In addition, we investigated the feasibility to perform two types of classification schemes based on protein levels using machine learning techniques: (a) a binary classification to discriminate between CACs+PCR vs CACs+Neg samples; and (b) a ternary classification into CACs treated with the serum from PCR+, IgG+asymptomatic and negative donors. Several supervised learning methods were applied in combination with a supervised attribute filter used to select features evaluating the worth of an attribute with a specified classifier (Deeb et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2021). Proteins were ranked according to their individual evaluations and the best 20 ranked ones were selected in each case.
Considering that complex models in small datasets limit generalization, low complexity models were used. In the case of the proposed ternary classification, performance metrics of linear support vector machines (SVM),

Naïve Bayes (NB) and Random Forest algorithms were compared. For the binary classification, we compared linear SVM, NB, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). In all cases, we combined the modelbased prediction with feature selection to optimize the performance of the classifier and to identify strongly discriminative proteins. Accuracy was used as evaluation measure in the feature selection process. Both, the model training, and the feature selection, were done in a fivefold cross-validation procedure. The quality of classification was assessed using several parameters: accuracy, recall, true and false positive rate, and the area under the ROC curve. MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, USA) and WEKA data mining software were used for building the models.
Results
Proteomic evaluation of asymptomatic COVID19 patients' serum In total, 191 proteins were identified in serum by proteomic analysis (Additional file 1: Table S2). Among them, several proteins were altered in asymptomatic patients (PCR+/IgG - and PCR -/IgG+at the time of serum extraction), compared to COVID-19 negative subjects (Fig. 2). The differential protein patterns seen between groups are shown in a heat-map cluster (Fig. 2A). Proteins like TTR, SERPINA1, FGA, THBS1 or CFHR1 were up-regulated in the serum of PCR+and IgG+donors compared to negative individuals, showing significant differences between them (Fig. 2B). Others, like ECM1 or APOH, were down-regulated in PCR+and IgG+serums compared to negative controls. In some cases, like APOD or Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), the levels increased in PCR+donors while decreased (still higher than in controls) in the serum of IgG+individuals. These proteins participate, among others, in the coagulation cascade process, platelet degranulation (APOH, ECM1, SERPINA1), or regulation of endothelial cell migration (APOH, ECM1, THBS1) and proliferation (AGT, APOD, HGFAC, FGA, SERPINA1) (Fig. 2C). Also, according to IPA analysis, some of them have been associated with viral infection (APOD, APOH, SERPINA1), severe COVID-19 (APOD, APOH, PCYOX1), or leukocyte migration (APOD, IGHV3-13, IGHV3-23, SERPINA1, IGLC7, IGLV3-21).
Molecular changes in CACs after incubation with COVID19 serum samples In total, 1438 proteins were identified in CACs incubated with the serum of COVID-19 negative (CACs+Neg), PCR+(CACs+PCR) and IgG+(CACs+IgG) asymptomatic donors (Additional file 1: Table S3). Furthermore,

according to the LFQ analysis (Fig. 3A, B), several proteins were up-regulated in CACs+PCR (19 proteins) or CACs+IgG (3 proteins) compared to CACs+Neg controls (Fig. 3C). Also, other proteins were downregulated (37 in CACs+PCR vs CACs+Neg and 30 in CACs+IgG vs CACs+Neg respectively) (Fig. 3C), while common alterations in both comparisons were identified too (Fig. 3D). A hierarchical classification of differentially expressed proteins indicated that the protein profiles of CACs in response to PCR+or IgG+serum were more similar between themselves than in CACs+Neg controls (Fig. 3E).
Proteins like Toll like receptor 2 (TLR2), Radixin, Matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14), Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), CD44, GLUL, RAB10 or FLNA were significantly up-regulated in CACs+PCR, but the levels decreased in CACs+IgG.

Similarly, proteins like Stabilin-1 (STAB1) or Myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA), were down-regulated in the CACs+PCR group while recovered in CACs+IgG+serums. Other proteins (COPZ1, RPS23, CAPN2, NCF1) were down-regulated in both, CACs+PCR and CACs+IgG compared to CACs+Neg controls. The most relevant changes are shown in Fig. 4.
Some of these differentially expressed proteins were clearly discriminative for CACs in response to PCR+vs Negative serum or between CACs+IgG vs CACs+Neg groups, as indicated by the high AUCs values (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, several proteins stood out as result of applying machine learning algorithms (Additional file 1: Tables S4-6), including MNDA, STAB1, TLR2 or the Heat shock protein family A member 5 (HSPA5), among others. The built linear SVM, NB, PLS-DA, and LASSO models presented an accuracy of 1.00, achieving

a maximum performance when classifying CACs+PCR and CACs+Neg treatments. Likewise, significant results were obtained with all these models (Table 1) when a ternary classification was applied to discriminate between CACs+PCR, CACs+IgG or CACs+Neg conditions. The NB classifier provided the best results, with an accuracy of 0.93 and a ROC area of 0.96 (Fig. 4C).
Functional classification of proteins differentially expressed in CACs after incubation with COVID19 serum samples The functional classification of differentially expressed proteins highlighted several major pathways altered in CACs+PCR (Fig. 5A). Moreover, according to IPA functional classification, several proteins altered in CACs in response to the PCR+serum have been previously linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or viral infection (Fig. 5B), together with leukocyte extravasation (Fig. 5C), among others. Similarly, some proteins altered in CACs+IgG were associated to coronavirus replication and its pathogenesis pathway (Fig. 4D). The most relevant functions of proteins altered in CACs+PCR cells are shown in Table 2.
Interaction networks between serum and CACs altered proteins An in-silico interaction network analysis was performed in order to find correlations between the proteins altered in the serum of COVID-19 asymptomatic donors and the protein changes in CACs in response to these factors (Fig. 6B). The networks found were mainly associated with platelet activation and signaling, as well as with extracellular matrix and activation of immune system in CACs. Several altered proteins in the serum of COVID19 positive asymptomatic donors (FGA, SERPINA1, THBS1) and moreover, in CACs treated with these serum factors (HSPA5, FN1), have been associated with platelet aggregation and coagulation problems (Fig. 6C).
Discussion COVID-19 asymptomatic individuals or with mild symptoms present similar loads of SARS-CoV-2 virus in respiratory samples than symptomatic patients (Ra et al. 2021; You et al. 2021), representing a population that highly increases the risk of viral transmission due to

the difficulties to identify and "isolate" them at the time of infection (Kronbichler et al. 2020; Gao et al. 2021). In addition, despite extraordinary research progress in the last two years, much is still unknown about the real impact of SARS-CoV-2 over the organism and the longterm consequences of such infection, even in asymptomatic individuals. In particular, the interaction of this virus with the cardiovascular system is still largely unknown.
To date, different studies have extensively analyzed the proteomic changes in serum, plasma or even urine from severe, critical, moderate or mild COVID-19 patients, in an attempt to identify potential signatures of the different stages of the disease (D'Alessandro et al. 2020; Messner et al. 2020; McArdle et al. 2021). However, not many studies have evaluated what happens in asymptomatic people. Herein, we have identified serum proteomic changes in asymptomatic individuals depending on the time of infection, including proteins up- or downregulated only at the highest infective peak (PCR+/IgG - in serum). These data corroborate that SARS-CoV-2 causes molecular alterations even in total or partial absence of classical symptoms. Many of the protein changes seen, mainly in PCR+serums, correlated to viral infection, platelet degranulation and leukocyte migration. These processes have already been described in severe COVID19 patients (Shen et al. 2020; Shu et al. 2020).
Among them, CETP was up-regulated in the serum of asymptomatic individuals, as previously seen in COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms (Liu et al. 2021), while in the serum of critical patients this protein appeared down-regulated (Shu et al. 2020). CETP mediates lipid exchange (Satoh et al. 2016), but it also inhibits prolonged inflammation. Thus, CETP upregulation might correlate with the alteration of lipids after viral infection (membrane fusion, vesicles, etc.) (Abu-Farha et al. 2020), or even contribute to the lack of symptomatology in these patients (Shu et al. 2020). Similarly, plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) was up-regulated mainly in PCR+asymptomatic individuals. PLTP regulates lipoprotein metabolism, as well as inflammation and immune response, affecting Th1/Th2 polarization via modulation of IL18 expression (Desrumaux et al. 2016). Remarkably, these and other serum proteins related to lipid metabolism were

previously seen in SARS-CoV patients, presenting an altered lipid and glucose metabolism even 12 years after infection (Wu et al. 2017). Further studies should evaluate the exact mechanisms by which coronaviruses affect lipid and glucose metabolism (Keihanian and Bigdelu 2020), since they could provide new insights regarding the adverse chronic cardiovascular complications.
Angiotensinogen (AGT) was also up-regulated in the serum of asymptomatic donors. AGT interacts with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), one of the main receptors responsible of SARS-CoV-2 entrance into the host cells which has been associated to COVID-19 cardiovascular complications (Wang et al. 2020; Wicik et al. 2020). In addition, other proteins up-regulated were thrombospondin (THBS1), fibrinogen  (FGA) or Von Willebrand factor (vWF), normally secreted by platelets during the degranulation process (Mehta and Yusuf 2003). These three proteins were already identified as procoagulant and thrombo-inflammatory markers in severe COVID-19 patients (Liu et al. 2021; Wool and Miller 2021; Zamanian-Azodi et al. 2021; Ward et al. 2021), but our data suggest that they are also altered at the peak of infection even in absence of symptoms. Since up-regulation of proteins like vWF correlates with inflammation, leaving the endothelium in a prothrombotic state (Ladikou et al. 2020; Escher et al. 2020), the potential long-term consequences of such endothelial damage in asymptomatic people should be tracked.
With this in mind, we next addressed whether the serum of asymptomatic COVID-19 individuals could affect basal endothelial cell function, by evaluating the protein changes taking place in CACs. Recent studies have reported an up-regulation of circulating EPCs levels even three months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, pointing them as vascular injury markers (Nizzoli et al. 2020). Thus, the effect of viral infection over these cells might help to explain potential cardiovascular secondary effects (Poyatos et al. 2021). Remarkably, many of the proteins altered in CACs incubated ex vivo with the

serums of asymptomatic donors have been previously associated with viral infection, infection by RNA virus and SARS, but also to ECs movement or proliferation, and endothelial dysfunction. Besides, the alteration of proteins related to leukocyte extravasation and movement in CACs exposed to the serum of PCR+people, corroborates the activation of the immune process in these cells (Eslava-Alcon et al. 2020; Beltrán-Camacho et al. 2021; Medina et al. 2011). In response to proinflammatory stimuli such as viral infection, circulating EPCs initiate weak cell-cell interactions with the endothelium, promoting the expression of adhesion molecules such as E-selectin or ICAM-1 by these cells, which also promotes vascular permeability, EPCs adhesion and trans-endothelial migration (Krenning et al. 2009), as well as leukocyte recruitment (Othumpangat et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2020; Dai et al. 2008). Interestingly, ICAM-1 appeared up-regulated in CACs+PCR cells, but returned to basal levels in CACs+IgG. Elevated levels of ICAM-1 have been associated with severe endothelial dysfunction in severe COVID-19 patients (Nagashima et al. 2020; Tong et al. 2020). Also, the number of ICAM-1+circulating EPCs appeared significantly increased in convalescent COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (Chioh et al. 2021). Thus, ICAM-1 levels might be indicative of the patient's progression towards a worse condition or a prompt recovery without major consequences, at least at the short term. Similarly, MMP14 was only up-regulated in CACs+PCR cells. MMP14 promotes LDL receptors shedding (Alabi et al. 2021), and it also participates in tissue remodeling by degrading several extracellular matrix components (collagen, gelatin, fibronectin, etc.), which is usually associated to inflammation (Xia et al. 2021; Hwang et al. 2004). Overall, MMP14 may regulate the infiltration and migration of inflammatory precursor cells under arterial inflammation (Ries et al. 2007).
CD44, receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA) in adult ECs and CACs, was also up-regulated in CACs+PCR cells, in agreement with recent findings reporting high circulating HA levels in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (Queisser et al. 2021). Similarly, heparin sulfate levels increased in HUVECs incubated with the plasma of COVID-19 patients, which was associated with endothelial glycocalyx shedding and degradation (Potje et al. 2021). Indeed, the glycocalyx becomes significantly damaged in severe COVID-19 patients, correlating with vascular damage in these patients (Queisser et al. 2021; Yamaoka-Tojo 2020; Teuwen et al. 2020). Finally, the incubation of human lung microvascular ECs with HA isolated from the plasma of COVID-19 patients, promoted endothelial barrier dysfunction in a CD44depedent manner (Queisser et al. 2021).

Radixin was also over-expressed only in CACs+PCR. This protein shares 70% of the sequence with Ezrin, which appears to interact with the S spike protein of SARS-CoV, reducing viral entry (Millet et al. 2012), while in other cases like the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Erzin enhances viral infectivity (Roy et al. 2014; Gadanec et al. 2021). Like Ezrin, Radixin might be exerting similar roles by modulating viral entry, although further studies should confirm such hypothesis.
Machine learning algorithms reported a list of proteins highly discriminating between the three groups compared (CACs+PCR, CACs+IgG or CACs+Neg). Among them, TLR2, up-regulated only in CACs+PCR, constitutes a cell surface innate immune sensor that can recognize several viral proteins upon infection (OliveiraNascimento et al. 2012), including the SARS-CoV-2 protein (Zheng et al. 2021). TLR2 activation in response to the SARS-CoV-2 E-protein promotes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF- and INF- in vivo and in vitro, in both human and mice cells. Interestingly, the administration of TLR2 inhibitors to infected mice might protect against SARS-CoV-2 by impairing the

release of cytokines (IL6, MCP1 or CXCL10) necessary for the development of the disease (Zheng et al. 2021; Sariol and Perlman 2021). Remarkably, TLR2 decreased significantly to basal levels in CACs+IgG. Thus, the blockade of TLR2 might prevent the progression of the disease towards a more severe stage. Different clinical trials using TLR-antagonists (M5049, MMG11, CuCpt22, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, imiquimod, etc.) are currently evaluating this therapeutic strategy (Gadanec et al. 2021; Patra et al. 2021; Grabowski et al. 2020).
The cell-surface receptor HSPA5, up-regulated mainly in CACs+PCR, has been proposed as an additional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry, together with ACE2, susceptible to viral recognition through the substrate-binding domain (Ha et al. 2020; Chu et al. 2018). Indeed, HSPA5 inhibitors interfere with SARSCoV-2 infection (Palmeira et al. 2020), corroborating this hypothesis, while HSPA5 levels might predispose to a severe progression and outcome of COVID-19 in patients with older age, obesity, and diabetes (Shin et al. 2021).
MNDA was one of the most discriminating proteins highlighted by the predictive approaches. MNDA is

Fig.6 Interactions between proteins altered in serum and CACs samples. A Venn's diagram including the number of proteins up- or down-regulated, common or exclusive in serum samples and CACs+PCR vs CACs+Neg and CACs+IgG vs CACs+Neg comparisons. B An in-silico analysis evaluating the potential interactions between altered proteins in the serum of COVID-19 asymptomatic donors (PCR+and IgG+) and the proteins altered in healthy CACs in response to those serums was performed with PINA v3 on-line platform. C One of the most representative functions found between the interactions found between both sets (serum and CACs) of altered proteins was platelet activation, including platelet aggregation and degranulation. Figure obtained with Reactome

required for INF production from human blood cells in response to viruses (Gu et al. 2022). MNDA down-regulation in CAC+PCR might reflect down-regulation of INF, a powerful antiviral factor, in an attempt of SARSCoV-2 to endorse its own propagation and infectability (Gu et al. 2022). The application of IFN therapy to COVID-19 patients resulted in accelerated viral clearance from the upper airways and in a reduction of the inflammatory biomarkers IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) (Zhou et al. 2020). The fact that the MNDA went back to "normal" levels in CACs treated with IgG+serums could be indicative of cells overcoming the anti-viral blockade and cell post-infection recovery. Future studies should validate whether MNDA contributes indeed to the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Finally, the interactions detected between the altered serum factors and the protein changes in CACs correlated with platelet activation, degranulation and an activation of the coagulation cascade. Noteworthy, EPCs are known to modulate platelet's function and they also seem

to limit thrombogenic events by supporting vascular repair of injured areas (Li and Li 2016; Abou-Saleh et al. 2009). Given the few interactions found with this in silico approach, the changes in CACs might be promoted by additional serum proteins, not identified herein, or even by other molecules such as microRNA or exosomes present in serum after COVID-19 infection.
Several limitations of this study should be addressed, such as the fact that serum samples were collected at the early period of the pandemic, and the number of samples collected was limited. Furthermore, donors were recruited prior vaccination started, so the potential effect that vaccines could have over the endothelial response should be also evaluated in future assays. Similarly, CACs were obtained from two healthy donors from whom no information was provided due to data protection assignments. Future studies may determine whether the response seen in our study would be different depending on the "endothelial" donors' profile (healthy vs individuals with certain pathologies).

Conclusions Overall, our results indicate that the ex-vivo incubation of CACs with the serum from COVID-19 asymptomatic patients promoted changes that resembled the effects associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection (inflammatory response, ECM disruption and vascular damage, among others). Remarkably, such processes are currently considered as the primary causes of COVID-19 related coagulopathy. Therefore, our model has proven to be effective to evaluate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 at the cellular level. The protein changes detected were different depending on the disease stage, when cells were exposed to serum of PCR+donors (at the highest peak of infection) or the serum of IgG+/PCR - patients that had already overcome the disease with no apparent symptoms. Some of the proteins identified here, such as TLR2, ICAM-1, CD44, HSPA5 or MNDA, might be considered as potential targets to inhibit the direct or indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the endothelium and the vascular system. Further studies should evaluate whether the continuous alteration of these proteins correlates with the individual's progression to a more severe condition or even with long-hauler sequelae or, on the contrary, their modulation could help to overcome the disease hopefully without major consequences.

The pathogenesis of coronavirus19 disease
Alain C. Borczuk1 and Rhonda K. Yantiss2* 

Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causal agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a systemic illness characterized by variably severe pulmonary symptoms, cardiac conduction abnormalities, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding, as well as neurologic deficits, renal insufficiency, myalgias, endocrine abnormalities, and other perturbations that reflect widespread microvascular injury and a pro-inflammatory state. The mechanisms underlying the various manifestations of viral infection are incompletely understood but most data suggest that severe COVID-19 results from virus-driven perturbations in the immune system and resultant tissue injury. Aberrant interferon-related responses lead to alterations in cytokine elaboration that deplete resident immune cells while simultaneously recruiting hyperactive macrophages and functionally altered neutrophils, thereby tipping the balance from adaptive immunity to innate immunity. Disproportionate activation of these macrophages and neutrophils further depletes normal activity of B-cells, T-cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. In addition, this proinflammatory state stimulates uncontrolled complement activation and development of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS), both of which promote the coagulation cascade and induce a state of "thrombo-inflammation". These perturbations have similar manifestations in multiple organ systems, which frequently show pathologic findings related to microvascular injury and thrombosis of large and small vessels. However, the pulmonary findings in patients with severe COVID-19 are generally more pronounced than those of other organs. Not only do they feature inflammatory thromboses and endothelial injury, but much of the parenchymal damage stems from failed maturation of alveolar pneumocytes, interactions between type 2 pneumocytes and non-resident macrophages, and a greater degree of NET formation. The purpose of this review is to discuss the pathogenesis underlying organ damage that can occur in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding these mechanisms of injury is important to development of future therapies for patients with COVID-19, many of which will likely target specific components of the immune system, particularly NET induction, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and subpopulations of immune cells.

infection had spread to every corner of the globe. The disease has since claimed well over six million lives worldwide and caused substantial morbidity among patients who survived their illnesses. Early in the pandemic, teams of investigators identified the causal agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) to be severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). They subsequently demonstrated its relationships to two other beta-coronaviruses known to cause severe pneumonia in humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as a highdegree of homology with a coronavirus found in bats [1].
The pathologic features of COVID-19 are variable in distribution and severity. Although most patients

have upper respiratory tract and pulmonary symptoms, those with severe disease may also develop widespread small and large vessel thrombosis, microvascular injury, cardiac conduction abnormalities, neurologic deficits, diarrheal symptoms, and gastrointestinal bleeding, any of which can be life-threatening. The mechanisms underlying disease manifestations are incompletely understood, yet most data suggest that severe COVID-19 results from a combination of immune dysregulation and depletion of key immune cell subsets, complement activation, and interactions between the innate immune system and the coagulation cascade that promote inflammatory thromboses. The purpose of this review is to discuss the pathogenesis underlying organ damage that can occur in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Viral structure and cell entry SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that contains four major types of proteins: nucleocapsid, membrane, envelope, and spike proteins. The spike protein is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2, that are required for viral entry into cells. The S1 subunit binds the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, whereas S2 is cleaved by transmembrane serine protease-2 (TMPRSS2), thereby facilitating viral fusion with the cell membrane [2]. Heavy glycosylation of spike protein shields it from the immune system and modulates the conformational dynamics of the receptor binding domain located on S1, thereby ensuring viral interactions with ACE2 [3]. The viral burden is highest in tissues expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, such as epithelia of the tracheobronchial tree, type 2 pneumocytes (AT2 cells), endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, and epithelial cells of the small bowel and colon. This distribution of cell susceptibility partly explains the constellation of symptoms commonly encountered among patients with COVID-19 [4-6].
In addition to ACE2 and TMPRSS2, other proteins can facilitate viral entry in a site-specific fashion. ACE2 is expressed in combination with cathepsin L in alveolar type 1 pneumocytes (AT1 cells) and AT2 cells, enterocytes, cardiomyocytes, and the placenta [7]. Cathepsins activate IL-1 and NLRP3-mediated inflammatory cascades that cause cell apoptosis or pyroptosis, and they play important roles in matrix remodeling, neutrophil recruitment, and emergency myelopoiesis. Viral attachment to the cell is facilitated by heparan sulfate, while furin-like cleavage sites on spike protein promote viral replication in the lung [8, 9]. Neuropilin1 (NRP1) binds these furin-derived substrates and assists viral entry into nasal cells [8, 9]. ACE2 can be expressed in combination with pro-inflammatory proteases (e.g., furin, PCSK5,

and PCSK7) that tend to be expressed at higher levels in males and increase with age [10].
Mechanisms of tissue injury due to SARSCoV2 Many of the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are related to virus-driven perturbations in the immune system and resultant tissue injury. Combinations of these changes can be distilled into three distinct groups based on aberrant interferon-related responses, cytokine alterations, recruitment of functionally altered immune cells, and uncontrolled complement activation with associated neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS) and systemic thrombosis. These groups include (1) humoral immunodeficiency with B-cell defects, (2) a hyperinflammatory state characterized by loss of T-cell subsets and high cytokine levels driven by IL-6, IL-1, TNF-, and (3) complement-driven injury [11]. These mechanisms are described further below.
Interferonrelated responses Interferon (IFN)-related responses represent important components of the host defense against viral infections. Interferons are broadly classified as types I, II, and III: type I IFNs bind to the IFN-/ receptor, type II IFN (IFN-) is activated by IL-12, and type III IFNs signal through either IL-10R2 (IL-10 receptor 2 subunit) or IFNLR-1 (interferon lambda receptor 1) complexes. Although IFNs are important components of the fight against viral infections, they can also promote tissue injury when present in excess, indicating that timing and organ location determine the net effects of IFN-mediated immune responses [12]. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells show increased type I IFN profiles that correlate with viral loads early in the disease course, followed by decreasing type I IFN as viral levels fall. However, IFN-related responses tend to be reduced or delayed in patients with severe COVID-19 [13]. Suboptimal IFNrelated responses in this setting may be due to genetic influences, neutralizing autoantibodies, or depleted numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells that produce TLR7, a toll-like receptor that detects single-stranded viral ribonucleic acids and promotes IFN-related responses [14].
Interferon levels vary among different tissues and tend to correlate with disease severity among COVID-19 patients. Type I IFN-related responses are important in early infection, although they are also persistently elevated among patients with sustained viral replication. Increased type II IFN is associated with severe disease at all sites, whereas type III IFN is mostly seen in the upper airways of patients with mild disease and high viral loads [15, 16]. It is possible that type III IFN-related responses in the upper airways are responsible for clearing SARSCoV-2 but when anti-viral efforts fail, the balance shifts

to a pro-inflammatory state sustained by types I and II IFN in the lower airways [17].
Data from animal models support the idea that severe COVID-19 is a consequence of failed IFN-driven antiviral activities. Ferrets with pneumonia due to SARSCOV-2 usually clear the virus, rather than succumb to it. These animals have increased M1 macrophages with anti-viral profiles (e.g., IL-1, CXCL8, and type I IFN) early in disease then switch to an anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage response in the resolution phases of disease [18]. On the other hand, aged ferrets have higher viral loads in their respiratory tracts, and they tend to develop more severe disease characterized by persistent T-cell activation and a M1 macrophage response without a timely switch to the M2 macrophage-mediated resolution phase. Persistent CXCL10 secreted by these macrophages functions as a chemoattractant for monocyte/ macrophages, NK cells, and T-cells, thereby driving the inflammatory state [19]. These observations suggest that severe COVID-19 in humans may result from a persistent M1 response without the M2 shift.

that is increased in autoimmune conditions and other inflammatory disorders [24]. Low-density neutrophils promote tissue injury by contributing to immune suppression, inducing thrombosis, and facilitating NET formation, as described below [25, 26].
Epithelial cells also elaborate MCP1/CCL2, CCL3, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL10, IL-8/CXCL8, IL-1, and TNF-; these cytokines recruit macrophages and further promote tissue damage [27]. As the disease progresses, normal alveolar macrophages are ultimately depleted and replaced by pro-inflammatory macrophages [28]. These HLA-DR-low/S100A-high monocytes are spatially related to epithelial cells, creating a sustained interface between epithelial and immune cells that promotes immune activation [12, 27, 29]. Similar alterations are seen in the lungs of African green monkeys, in which case viral replication in pneumocytes drives the immune response by spreading to macrophages as they ingest debris. In this situation, the macrophages that are recruited to the lung drive the immune response, rather than resident alveolar macrophages [30].

Cytokine responses Compared with influenza, the pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection features a greater degree of neutrophil degranulation and increased cytokine levels, particularly IL-1, IL-1RA, TNF-, G-CSF, CCL7, CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL11, and CXCL12a [20]. SARSCoV-2 infection can also precipitate macrophage activation syndrome, which is characterized by increased type II IFN-related responses as well as elevated IL-6, IL-1, TNF-, and ferritin levels [21]. Patients with severe COVID-19 typically have increased serum levels of IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, TNF-, MCP1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, IL-18, and MIP-1/CCL3, which promote a sustained pro-inflammatory state that may persist for up to 60 days [22, 23].
Cellular recruitment and functional perturbations Innate immunity SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes an imbalance between innate and adaptive immunity that becomes more pronounced when patients develop severe symptoms. Mild disease is characterized by an adaptive immune response with robust recruitment of plasmablasts and CD8+T-cells [13]. However, more severe disease features a predominance of innate immunity with elaboration of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-1 and TNF-) accompanied by lymphopenia and a decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, as well as markers of T-cell exhaustion [14]. Patients with severe COVID-19 also have increased numbers of low-density neutrophils, which comprise a subset of dysfunctional granulocytes

Adaptive immunity Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a disproportionate decrease in CD4+T-cells accompanied by alterations of T-cell subsets. Infected patients have increased ratios of naïve to memory CD4+T-cells and decreased T-regulatory cell populations, especially those modulating allergic responses and autoimmunity [31]. In addition, SARSCoV-2 infection stimulates Th1 cells, Th2 cells, and Th17 cells, the net effect of which is an elaboration of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17,
IL-21, IL-22, and G-CSF. Of these, IL-17 is specifically associated with autoimmunity, whereas G-CSF promotes neutrophilic activation [32]. Patients with severe disease also have increased numbers of LAG3positive T-cells. This T-cell subset is responsible for IL-10 production, which further reduces the cytotoxic effects of CD8+T-cells and suppresses IFN-mediated responses [33]. Alterations in T-cells occur in combination with decreased B-cell evolution in germinal centers, as evidenced by increased unmutated IGH clones and plasmablasts [12]. Abnormal circulating monocytes elaborate S100A8 and S100A9, which drive emergency myelopoiesis, suppress normal T-cell function, and delay viral clearance. Increased IFN- levels also activate NK cells to promote interferon-mediated responses that, when sustained, can lead to NK cell dysfunction and loss [14]. Indeed, emerging data suggest that severe COVID19 may result from an impaired immune response with delayed viral clearance rather than an excessive immune reaction and post-viral cytokine storm, as has been previously suggested. Timing and location are critical; the

lack of upper airway viral clearance allows viral entry to the lower airways and drives dysfunctional emergency responses, essentially combining theories of deficient viral clearance and excessive innate immune response.
Mechanisms of tissue injury Neutrophil extracellular traps Neutrophil extracellular traps are three-dimensional lattice-like structures composed of decondensed chromatin strands. Chromatin strands are studded with citrullinated histones, antimicrobial proteins, and cytokines, such that they can entrap and kill pathogens upon release from neutrophils undergoing apoptosis. NETs immobilize and clear organisms by positioning viruses in direct contact with anti-viral proteins. NET formation is associated with increased IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, RANTES/ CCL5 and platelet factor 4, and can be induced directly by viable SARS-CoV-2 [34, 35]. The NET response is one of several critical components of innate immunity, but it can become dysregulated and result in cell injury. Once

activated, NETs promote a positive feedback loop that drives platelet aggregation and cytokine release, as well as complement activation [36]. Plasma, tracheal aspirates, lung tissue, and arterial thrombi from patients with severe COVID-19 all contain increased numbers of NETs compared with tissues from patients with pulmonary disease unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 [37, 38]. Importantly, the histologic hallmarks of NETs, namely neutrophils associated with microthrombosis (Fig. 1A), likely account for clinically severe COVID-19 pneumonia [39, 40]. Recognition of the pivotal role NETs play in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 may help identify therapies that inhibit NET induction and become an important strategy for managing critically ill patients [41].
Thrombosis Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS are at risk for systemic endothelial injury and thrombosis involving both venous and arterial systems [42, 43]. They are more likely to develop pulmonary endothelial injury and thrombosis

Fig.1 Acute COVID-19 pneumonia features neutrophil extracellular traps (asterisk) that expand the alveolar wall, thereby increasing pulmonary resistance and impairing diffusion. Neutrophil extracellular traps appear as collections of neutrophils, nuclear debris accompanied engorged and damaged capillaries (A). Small arterial thrombi (asterisk) are frequently present in the lungs of patients with COVID-19 related pulmonary symptoms (B). Capillary beds in the alveolar walls show marked accumulation of platelet-rich thrombi, which is highlighted by immunohistochemistry for CD61. (A, B hematoxylin and eosin stain)

(Fig. 1B) than patients with influenza, and they have higher bleeding rates with elevated markers of systemic injury such as CRP, ESR, fibrinogen and pro-calcitonin [44]. Activation of P-selectin in resting platelets, von Willebrand factor multimers, reduced ADAMTS-13, and increased blood viscosity support the concept that many patients with COVID-19 suffer from abnormal coagulation [45, 46]. The combination of platelet (Fig. 1C) and neutrophil activation also promotes NET formation [47]. Current trends toward implementing anti-coagulation as part of the treatment regimen for severe COVID-19 appear to reduce 30-day mortality without increased bleeding risk [48].
Clinical features of SARSCoV2 infection The viral incubation period ranges from 4-14 days (median: 5). Many patients are asymptomatic carriers whereas others can become gravely ill. Bennet et al. evaluated 174,568 adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection and reported 20.2% to have severe disease with 18.6% requiring hospitalization during 2020. The overall mortality rate was 11.6%, although death rates decreased from 16.4% in early 2020 to 8.6% by the end of the year [49]. Symptomatic patients typically complain of cough, fever, myalgias, headache, and upper respiratory tract manifestations, whereas approximately 10% have nausea, diarrhea, or a loss of sense of taste and/or smell.
Risk factors for severe COVID19 Early in the pandemic, it became clear that advanced age, male gender, specific racial groups (e.g., African American, Latino, Native American), obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary or renal disease, and immunocompromise were associated with more severe disease, especially when multiple risk factors were present [50]. Specifically, patients with severe COVID-19 and high body mass indices tend to have increased IL-6 levels, endothelial injury, IFN activation, and cytokine profiles (e.g., IFN-, IL15, IL17, MCP1/ CCL2, MIP1-beta/CCL4) that suggest macrophage recruitment [51]. Viral entry may be enhanced among older patients, who tend to have greater expression of TMPRSS2 compared with younger individuals [52].
Several genetic factors may place patients at risk for severe COVID-19. Polymorphisms of OAS1, 2, and 3 represent possible susceptibility loci because they normally activate latent RNAse activity and promote resistance to RNA viruses. Interferon / receptor subunit 1 mutations, inborn errors in TLR3 and type I IFN pathway elements, and alterations in TYK2 and IFNAR2 are associated with severe COVID-19 [53-55]. As previously described, TLR7 is crucial sensor of ssRNA that activates human dendritic cells to produce anti-viral IFN

[56]. Variants in TLR7 have been reported in up to 2% of males under 60 years of age with severe COVID-19 [57]. Polymorphisms in ACE2 (rs2074192 and rs1978124) have a protective effect while rs2106809 and rs2285666 are associated with increased disease severity [58]. Notably, 10% of patients with critical COVID-19 have autoantibodies that neutralize type I IFN and these antibody levels increase with age, being present in 20% of patients more than 80 years of age who present with severe disease [59].
Pulmonary disease
Patterns of inflammation in the lung parenchyma Much of our understanding of the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 has been gleaned from autopsy studies, especially during the early months of the pandemic [60]. The combination of real-time tissue banking from blood and autopsy material for use in high-throughput multi-omics techniques led to rapid advancement in the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms underlying disease progression. Imaging mass cytometry showed SARS-COV-2 to predominantly infect lung epithelial cells, although other cell types also contain viral proteins. The levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on AT1 and AT2 cells suggest susceptibility to viral entry, and that increased ACE2-positive cells mirror the development of AT2 hyperplasia in severe disease. AT2 cells and macrophages propagate an IFN-mediated response, neutrophil degranulation, and cellular recruitment via MIP-1/CCL3 and MIP-1/ CCL4 through the effects of IL-6 and IL-1. In addition, persistent immaturity of AT2 cells and inadequate surfactant expression may contribute to persistent endorgan failure rather than parenchymal loss and scarring alone.
Viral detection rates in autopsy material tend to be highest in samples obtained from the upper and lower respiratory tracts with less frequent detection in the gastrointestinal tract and failure to identify organisms in the blood, brain, skin, and bile [61]. Most severe and fatal COVID-19 cases involve the lungs with a diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)-type pattern of injury that reflects clinical manifestations of ARDS (Fig. 2A). Some patients develop severe, rapidly progressive DAD resulting from the combined effects of direct viral infection (Fig. 2B, C), immune-mediated injury, and thrombosis, whereas others suffer progressive respiratory failure with organizing DAD. Emerging data suggest that the former situation is associated with higher viral loads, increased cytokine levels, and upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes, whereas the latter is characterized by lower viral loads and less contribution of IFN to the pathogenesis of disease [62].
COVID-19-related DAD typically features exudative and proliferative phases with hyaline membranes

Borczuk and Yantiss Journal of Biomedical Science (2022) 29:87

Page 6 of 15

Fig.2 Diffuse alveolar damage is characterized by hyaline membranes (asterisk) resulting from AT1 cell necrosis, as well as exuberant regeneration of AT2 cells during the first week following infection (A). Hyaline membranes and epithelial cells show immunoreactivity for spike protein (asterisk) using a red chromogen. B These areas also contain viral spike RNA (asterisk) as demonstrated with in situ hybridization using a brown chromogen (C). Such cases were also positive by real time polymerase chain reaction (not shown) (A hematoxylin and eosin stain)

(Fig. 3A) and activated fibroblasts (Fig. 3B), respectively, although many cases show co-mingling of both patterns or a combination of these phases with organizing DAD and fibrosis (Fig. 3C). Some authors have described loss of epithelial cells and an influx of non-resident interstitial macrophages in transitional areas between exudative and organizing DAD [29]. This finding, which has not been reported in ARDS unrelated to COVID-19, suggests SARS-CoV-2 elicits a pro-inflammatory epithelial-monocyte interface [63]. This alteration may predict steroidresponsiveness of pulmonary disease.
Although patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and ongoing lung injury usually have exudative DAD-type pulmonary disease, some also have changes resembling acute bronchopneumonia that likely reflect bacterial superinfection. AT2 cells associated with hyaline membranes are more likely to contain detectable virus by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Detection rates are highest within two weeks of infection and decrease over time, although some patients with chronic

pulmonary disease still have detectable organisms [64, 65]. Patients who survive the initial phases of severe lung injury can develop pulmonary fibrosis (Fig. 3D) following resolution of ARDS [66, 67].
A subset (<20%) of COVID-19 patients with pneumonia have "happy hypoxemia" with a paradoxical lack of dyspnea despite poor oxygenation. These cases are characterized by maintained lung compliance, a lack of hypoxic vasoconstriction, and larger intrapulmonary shunts than typically occur in patients with ARDS [68, 69]. Other severely ill patients with airway patency have low respiratory compliance and poorly recruited regions of the lung that require high driving pressures to maintain oxygenation [70-72]. These seemingly distinct clinical subtypes could reflect different timepoints during disease, with the latter occurring when patients develop intrapulmonary thrombosis, as discussed previously [73]. Prone positioning improves airway recruitability in both groups of patients.

Fig.3 Early COVID-19 causes lung injury characterized by mild congestion of small capillaries in the alveolar walls (asterisk) associated with inflammation and hyaline membranes (A). Organizing diffuse alveolar damage in COVID-19 features alveolar walls (asterisk) that are thickened by exuberant fibroblastic proliferations and lined by AT2 cells (B). Some cases show juxtaposition of acute injury with hyaline membranes (asterisk), AT2 cell hyperplasia, and interstitial fibroblastic proliferation (arrow) that expands the alveolar walls (C). The interstitial fibroblastic proliferation is replaced by dense collagen that stains blue with a trichrome stain (D). The alveolar architecture is lost in the late stages of COVID-19 lung disease (A-C hematoxylin and eosin stain)

Senescence COVID-19 can cause organ damage by inducing a macrophage-driven senescent phenotype in epithelial and endothelial cells that results from complement-mediated cytokine induction, thrombosis, and matrix remodeling [74]. Data from human and animal studies have also shown that SARS-CoV-2 stimulates macrophages and T-cells in bronchioloalveolar lavage material, which, in turn, induce pulmonary ciliated and club cells to express markers of senescence such as CDKN2a, CDKN1a, uPAR, CXCL8, IGFBP3 and GDF15 [75].
Long COVID A minority of patients, particularly women, continue to experience breathlessness, cough, fatigue, and other symptoms months to years following recovery from COVID-19 [76]. Affected individuals commonly have a measurable diffusion impairment as well as alterations in lung perfusion that may be related to persistent

microvascular injury [77]. Pulmonary function tests tend to correlate with the initial disease severity, but do not necessarily bear any relationship to specific symptoms. Patients with long COVID also have altered plasma biomarker levels compared with patients who fully recover. Significant differences in levels of neutrophil markers (e.g., lipocalin-2, matrix metalloproteinases, and repair proteins such as HGF) suggest persistent tissue inflammation and remodeling among patients with long COVID [78].
Cardiovascular disease
Endothelial injury Although endothelial cells express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and, thus, are potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2, most data suggest that endothelial damage in the context of COVID-19 results from immune activation of endothelial cells by cytokines, kallikrein-kinin activation, IL-6 induction, and complement activation [79]. Any of these

Borczuk and Yantiss Journal of Biomedical Science (2022) 29:87

Page 8 of 15

factors can promote endothelial cell death via apoptosis or pyroptosis, the latter of which is a mechanism of cell death important to controlling microbial infection. Endothelial injury promotes vascular damage and thrombosis, resulting in dysfunction of multiple organs and organ systems [80, 81].
Cardiac injury While early reports included cases of myocarditis, the histopathology of cardiac injury is not frequently associated with inflammation or myocardial necrosis (Fig. 4A). Microvascular injury (Fig. 4B) is central to the proposed mechanism of cardiac injury among patients with SARSCoV-2 infection [82, 83]. It is likely that the combination of NET formation and platelet activation promote coronary thrombosis to a greater degree than endothelial activation, although different factors may promote injury during various phases of disease [84]. Single cell sequencing studies have not identified the virus in cardiac muscle cells but have shown decreased cardiomyocytes and pericytes relative to endothelial cells [85]. Bulk RNA sequencing studies have demonstrated altered cardiomyocyte differentiation without morphologic abnormalities, raising the possibility that SARS-COV-2 causes organ dysfunction through its effects on differentiation rather than cellular loss [86]. Data from animal models suggest that sinoatrial cells are susceptible to SARS-COV-2 infection and subsequent arrhythmias [87].
COVID19 and the brain Many patients with COVID-19 develop neuropsychiatric symptoms, most of which reflect aberrant inflammatory responses, microvascular injury, and thrombosis in

the brain. Single-nucleus transcriptome analyses have failed to detect viral transcripts in the brains of patients with COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms, and western blots fail to detect viral spike protein in these tissues [88]. Rather, transcriptional changes in the cortical microglia suggest increased cellular activation, mobility, and phagocytosis with perturbations in barrier cells of the choroid plexus that allow parenchymal infiltration by peripheral T-cells [89]. These alterations cause persistent neuronal damage affecting synaptic signaling of upper-layer excitatory neurons similar to changes seen in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.
Gastrointestinal effects of SARSCoV2
The small and large intestines Both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and, thus, it is not surprising that gastrointestinal infection by SARS-CoV-2 is relatively common [4, 90, 91]. In fact, more than one-third of patients with pulmonary symptoms have detectable virus in their stool samples, which may persist for weeks to months following onset of COVID-19-related symptoms [92]. Approximately 20% of infected patients develop gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, or non-bloody diarrhea. The severity of gastrointestinal manifestations does not necessarily correlate with the severity of pulmonary symptoms [93].
In vitro models utilizing intestinal organoids have shown the virus to directly infect colonic epithelial cells, then spread rapidly via cell-to-cell transmission [94]. Colonic infection by SARS-CoV-2 elicits cytologic changes unaccompanied by substantial epithelial cell necrosis or mucosal inflammation [95]. Infected cells

Fig.4 Despite clinical cardiac dysfunction, the histomorphology of cardiac tissue is often relatively unremarkable in patients with severe COVID-19. Sections of the heart from this patient who died of COVID-19 is essentially normal and lacks both inflammation and necrosis (A). Microvascular injury, as evidence by intra-myocardial thrombi, may play a role in cardiac disease. Fibrin thrombi (asterisk) are highlighted by immunohistochemistry for CD61 (B)(A, hematoxylin and eosin)

Fig.5 A colonic resection specimen from a patient with COVID-19 and no gastrointestinal symptoms shows subtle features of viral infection. The colonic crypts are slightly dilated near the surface and have a slightly tufted appearance (asterisk) that reflects clustered epithelial cells with nuclear crowding (A). The same areas show strong signal for spike protein RNA by in situ hybridization (asterisk) using a brown chromagen (B). Another patient with mild respiratory symptoms due to COVID-19 developed gastrointestinal bleeding. Biopsy samples from the duodenal mucosa shows normal villous architecture with patchy hemorrhages (asterisk) and regenerative epithelium with cytoplasmic depletion. C Platelet-rich thrombi (asterisk) are present in vessels (D). A third patient with COVID-19 developed severe diarrheal symptoms presumably due to the pro-inflammatory state promoted by the virus. Samples obtained from the jejunum display mild villous shortening with striking crypt hyperplasia and regenerative epithelial changes unaccompanied by substantially increased inflammation (E). Colonic samples from the same patient show a similar degree of epithelial cell injury without increased inflammation. Dilated crypts (asterisk) contain mucin-depleted cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and disorganized nuclei (F)

tend to be crowded with a tufted appearance, mucindepletion, and blebs of eosinophilic cytoplasm, particularly in the superficial crypts and surface epithelium

(Fig. 5A). Cells that display these cytologic abnormalities show strong, diffuse signal for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by in situ hybridization, immunopositivity for the

spike protein, and ultrastructural evidence of viral infection (Fig. 5B) [95].
It is worth noting that direct viral infection of the gastrointestinal tract is likely a transient event that causes few, or no symptoms. Most gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 are probably secondary to cytokine elaboration, hypercoagulability, and microvascular injury triggered by the virus, rather than direct viral cytotoxicity. Westerhoff, et al. evaluated gastrointestinal specimens from 25 patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal testing but could not consistently demonstrate detectable virus in the gastrointestinal tract, even when inflammatory or ischemic-type changes were present in the samples [96]. Zhang et al. also failed to identify SARS-CoV-2 by either immunohistochemistry for the nucleocapsid protein or in situ hybridization for viral spike protein RNA when evaluating 28 bowel resection cases from patients with COVID-19 [97].
Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are prone to coagulopathies and, thus, gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 most commonly include ischemic-type changes with thrombi in the small and/or large intestines [98-103]. These changes may develop days to weeks after viral detection and onset of pulmonary symptoms and, thus, ancillary studies generally fail to demonstrate the organism in biopsy and resection specimens [104, 105]. Patchy mucosal hemorrhage and fibrin thrombi in small capillaries may be present in biopsies obtained upon onset of gastrointestinal symptoms, at which point the background mucosa may be normal or show epithelial cell regeneration with cytoplasmic depletion and mild nuclear enlargement (Fig. 5C, D). Resection specimens show more extensive ulcers with thrombi in small and large submucosal veins, as well as patchy necrosis of the muscularis propria. In the previously cited study, Zhang et al. reported frequent fibrin thrombi, strands of fibrin in non-occluded enteric vessels, and a high rate (60%) of pneumatosis in patients with ischemic enterocolitis due to COVID-19 compared with patients who had ischemic enterocolitis due to other causes. The same authors also described a minority of cases that showed patchy fibrosis of the outer muscularis propria, suggestive of chronic ischemic injury [97].
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can promote epithelial cell damage in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in diarrheal symptoms rather than signs and symptoms of bleeding (Fig. 5E, F). The virus downregulates ACE2 expression on the gut epithelium, which diminishes the counterregulatory effects of ACE2 on angiotensin II-mediated signaling and increases inflammation [106]. Decreased ACE2 expression disrupts ACE2-mediated tryptophan absorption and negatively affects amino acid homeostasis. In addition, lower levels of ACE2 lead to diminished

mTOR-mediated expression of antimicrobial proteins at the luminal surface [106, 107]. The virus also promotes a pro-inflammatory state through ACE2-independent mechanisms that involve elaboration of pro-inflammatory cytokines [82].
The pancreas Type I diabetes mellitus is characterized by immunemediated destruction of the islets of Langerhans in genetically susceptible patients, most of whom have either HLA-DR3 or HLA-DR4 haplotypes [108]. Its pathogenesis is not entirely clear, but there is ample evidence that some RNA viruses, namely rotaviruses and coxsackieviruses, contribute to disease development and persist in islet -cells for prolonged periods of time. Viral entry into -cells can cause direct cytotoxic injury, resulting in cell death. Alternatively, elaboration of viral antigens combined with -cell-specific antigens, evokes an immune response that results in -cell destruction, especially in the context of increased IFN production and upregulation of class I major histocompatibility complexes [109].
Early in the pandemic, it became clear that patients with diabetes mellitus were at risk for more severe SARSCoV-2 infections [50]. However, emerging data also suggest an increased risk for new-onset diabetes mellitus, as well as metabolic complications of pre-existing diabetes mellitus among patients with resolving COVID-19. The effects of COVID-19 on glucose homeostasis are likely multifactorial. -cells express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, as well as other entry factors, such as neuropilin-1 (NP-1), transferrin receptor (TFRC), FURIN, CTSL, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) [110, 111]. Like rotaviruses and coxsackieviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can directly damage -cells and induce apoptosis once inside the cell [110, 111]. However, it also downregulates insulin gene transcription, while glucagon and other peptides are upregulated, and causes transdifferentiation of -cells to express both endocrine and acinar markers [112]. Viral binding depletes ACE2 at the cell surface and diminishes its counterregulatory effects on angiotensin II-mediated signaling. Activation of the renin-angiotensin pathway further promotes insulin resistance, inflammation, and -cell dysfunction [113].
Dermatologic manifestations of COVID19 The cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 are broadly grouped in six patterns of injury: confluent erythematous/maculopapular/morbilliform rash, urticarial rash, papulovesicular exanthem, Chilblain-like acral pattern, livedo reticularis/racemose-like pattern, and purpuric pattern [114]. These patterns of injury likely reflect cutaneous reactions to circulating viral antigens and thus, typically feature endothelial injury and perivascular

Borczuk and Yantiss Journal of Biomedical Science (2022) 29:87

Page 11 of 15

inflammation of dermal vessels. Nearly 50% of patients with rashes related to SARS-CoV-2 have erythematous or maculopapular eruptions that develop after the onset of systemic symptoms. These lesions tend to be pruritic and show a symmetrical distribution over the trunk with progression in a centrifugal fashion [115]. Although data are scarce, these eruptions seem to reflect some type of vascular injury, often with perivascular lymphocytic or neutrophilic infiltrates [116, 117]. Urticarial rashes are most pronounced over the trunk and limbs and may be accompanied by angioedema or urticarial vasculitis [118]. They usually present at the same time as other systemic symptoms although they can precede pulmonary disease manifestations in occasional patients. Papulovesicular exanthems typically feature scattered vesicles over the trunk with, or without, pruritis [114]. Biopsies reveal epidermal acantholysis with ballooned keratinocytes and endothelial inflammation in dermal vessels [119].
Chilblain-like acral pattern, livedo reticularis/racemose-like pattern, and purpuric pattern eruptions typically feature both endothelial damage and thromboses, possibly due to IFN-mediated inflammatory reactions or endothelial injury secondary to circulating viral particles [120]. Chilblain-like lesions appear as violaceous plaques predominantly located on the feet with occasional involvement of the hands or ears. These lesions are commonly painful or itchy and, unlike other dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19, tend to occur in patients with minimal, or no, systemic symptoms [121]. The livedo reticularis/racemose-like pattern appears as lace-like dusky patches of blue discoloration and likely reflects slow blood flow secondary to thrombosis of small superficial vessels in the dermis. Magro et al. described three patients with this pattern of injury, all of whom had a pauci-inflammatory microthrombotic vasculopathy, leading the authors to hypothesize that thrombosis resulted from complement activation in the absence of an appropriate IFN-related immune response [120, 122]. In contrast, the purpuric pattern of injury represents a true vasculitis likely secondary to direct endothelial damage by viral particles [123]. This hemorrhagic blistering or nodular rash tends to occur in intertriginous regions or show an acral distribution. Biopsy samples demonstrate a leukocytoclastic vasculitis with fibrin thrombi and injured endothelial cells [124].
Conclusions The normal anti-viral response initially involves type I IFN elaboration from NK cells and CD8+T-cells, ultimately killing infected cells and clearing the virus, whereas severe viral infections elicit IL-8/CXCL8 activation that promotes neutrophil chemotaxis, activation, and NET formation. This process is regulated by

plasmacytoid dendritic cells that both produce type I IFN and decrease IL-8/CXCL8 production [125]. Dysregulation of these immune responses is central to development of COVID-19, as the combined effects of lymphopenia, reduced NK cells and CD8+T-cells, and decreased plasmacytoid dendritic cells diminish type I IFN-mediated responses and causes a shift toward IL-8/ CXCL8-induced neutrophil recruitment [126]. Continued induction of MCP1/CCL2, CXCL10, IL-6, TNF- and IL-1 combined with terminal complement activation further stimulate neutrophil activity, culminating in NET formation and an environment conducive to inflammatory thromboses [126]. These perturbations have similar manifestations in multiple organ systems, which generally show pathologic findings related to microvascular injury and thrombosis of large and small vessels. However, the pulmonary findings in patients with severe COVID-19 are generally more pronounced than those of other organs. Not only do they feature inflammatory thromboses and endothelial injury, but much of the parenchymal damage stems from failed maturation of alveolar pneumocytes, interactions between AT2 cells and non-resident macrophages, and a greater degree of NET formation. Understanding these mechanisms of injury is important to development of future therapies for patients with COVID-19, many of which will likely target specific components of the immune system, particularly NET induction, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and specific subpopulations of immune cells.

Abstract: A 44-year-old man developed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia during immunochemother-
apy consisting of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab for non-small cell lung cancer. Low-grade fever, followed by mild hypoxemia, and febrile neutropenia, were observed, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was administered until the recovery of neutropenia, when he developed a high fever, severe hypoxemia, and hypotension accompanied by consolidation in the bilateral lungs. His conditions promptly improved after treatment including hydrocortisone and the primary and metastatic tumors remained regressed for 10 months without further treatment. Post-COVID-19 organizing pneumonia during cancer immunochemotherapy can be aggravated by immune-checkpoint inhibitors and G-CSF.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread worldwide (1). The thoracic cancers international COVID-19 collaboration (THERAVOLT) registry demonstrated a high mortality rate (33%) in patients with thoracic malignancies, mostly nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who developed COVID19 (2). Impaired antiviral immunity and vascular endothelial damage, and a hypercoagulable state, especially during systemic chemotherapy, makes lung cancer patients more vulnerable to COVID-19 (3). In addition, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and other drugs for immunotherapy and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for the treatment of chemotherapy-related febrile neutropenia may increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 due to excessive activation of the immune system, further exacerbat-

ing the "cytokine storm" evoked by SARS-CoV-2 infection (4).
We herein present a case of severe post-COVID-19 organizing pneumonia during immunochemotherapy for lung cancer. The patient, who had presented with mild symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia and chemotherapy-related febrile neutropenia, was treated with antibiotics and G-CSF. He then developed delayed-onset respiratory and circulatory failure with systemic inflammation after recovery from neutropenia, possibly due to severe post-COVID-19 organizing pneumonia.
Case Report
A 44-year-old man with NSCLC developed fever during hospitalization for immunochemotherapy. One year before admission, a right lung tumor was discovered when he visited a clinic due to persistent cough. Because the patient declined to undergo bronchoscopy for a histological examina-

Figure1.Thoracic computed tomography images after hospitalization. Ground-glass opacities were observed in the lower lobe of the right lung on day 4 (A), which changed into consolidation in the bilateral lungs on day 9 (B). On day 19, when the patient experienced respiratory and circulatory failure, the consolidation in the posterior basal regions increased in density (C). Consolidation in the bilateral lungs mostly disappeared on day 34 (D).

tion or chemotherapy, radiation therapy alone was performed based on the clinical diagnosis of lung cancer (cT4N2M0, stage IIIB), with 60 Gy delivered to the primary tumor and adjacent mediastinal lymph nodes and 50 Gy delivered to the right hilum.
Eight months later, regrowth of the primary tumor in the right lung occurred, accompanied by intrapulmonary metastasis. Transbronchial biopsy with bronchoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of NSCLC without mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor or anaplastic lymphoma kinase genes. Although the tumor proportion score of programmed cell death-ligand 1 staining was >50%, immunotherapy was not selected to avoid recall pneumonitis. Three courses of chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin (area under the curve, 5) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m3) every three weeks was administered, with modest adverse effects, but it had little effect on the primary or metastatic lesions. Therefore, at one month before admission, pembrolizumab (200 mg/body) an ICI - was added to the fourth course of chemotherapy.
On admission, his body temperature was 36.8°C, without any new lesions on chest radiography, and he underwent the fifth course of immunochemotherapy as scheduled. The next day, his body temperature rose to 38°C, and thoracic computed tomography (CT) revealed ground-glass opacities in the right lung (Fig. 1A). Polymerase chain reaction was

positive for SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA). There was no hypoxemia or clinical symptoms other than lowgrade fever until day 9, when he developed high fever and mild hypoxemia (percutaneous oxygen saturation, 93%), neutropenia (91/mm3), thrombocytopenia (49,000/mm3), with the worsening of the opacities in the bilateral lungs (Fig. 1B). Although his low-grade fever persisted, his condition stabilized and his serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) decreased from 20.1 to 3.0 mg/dL after treatment with supplemental oxygen (2 L/min), inhaled ciclesonide and favipiravir as antiviral agents, and granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) and cefepime for febrile neutropenia.
On day 19, his condition suddenly deteriorated, with high fever (40°C), tachypnea (30/min), tachycardia (144/min), hypotension (systolic blood pressure of 80-90 mmHg), and severe hypoxemia. Laboratory investigations revealed neutrophilia (18,000/mm3), increased serum levels of CRP (10.2 mg/dL), D-dimer (85.8 ng/mL), and liver and renal dysfunction (Fig. 2), although blood culture results were negative. Thoracic CT demonstrated consolidation in the right upper lobe and bilateral lower lobes of the lungs (Fig. 1C). He was placed on intermittent mandatory ventilation. Meropenem, hydrocortisone (200 mg/day for 4 days), noradrenaline, and unfractionated heparin followed by edoxaban tosi-

late hydrate were administered. The treatment responses were prompt; fever and consolidation in the lungs disappeared within 24 hours and the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen improved from 82 to 346 within 4 days, and the administration of noradrenaline was stopped. The patient was successfully weaned off the ventilator on day 29 (Fig. 2). Contrast-enhanced CT on day 34 revealed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis. The patient was discharged on day 52.
Although immunochemotherapy for lung cancer was discontinued, the primary and metastatic tumors remain regressed, with the total tumor diameter decreasing from 23.5 cm on admission to 8.8 and 8.4 cm at 6 and 10 months, respectively. His serum cytokeratin 19 fragment 21-1 level also decreased from 33.8 ng/mL to 1.0 ng/mL.
Discussion
We report a case of COVID-19 pneumonia in a patient under immunochemotherapy for lung cancer and G-CSF treatment for febrile neutropenia, who developed progressive pulmonary consolidation followed by late-onset respiratory and circulatory failure with systemic inflammation. The patient recovered with unusually prompt responses to a moderate dose of corticosteroids.
COVID-19 is often associated with delayed deterioration of the respiratory condition at approximately 10 days after the onset of pneumonia (1). In some cases, this progressively develops into respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar damage. The present case did not fit this temporal course

of COVID-19, as the patient's respiratory condition was stable until day 19, when it abruptly worsened accompanied by high fever and circulatory failure. We considered the possibility of pulmonary thromboembolism because of the thrombophilic condition due to COVID-19 and underlying malignancy, and markedly elevated serum D-dimer levels (5). However, high fever could not be explained with the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism, and we could not find any evidence of deep vein thrombosis after his recovery. Other possible causes that we considered were infectious diseases such as sepsis and COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis, radiation pneumonitis, or pseudoprogression of primary tumors. However, an unexpectedly prompt response to treatment with hydrocortisone and the favorable prognosis implicates the role of systemic inflammation due to hyperactivated immune systems rather than infectious diseases. Recall pneumonitis after ICI treatment or pseudoprogression of the primary tumors was unlikely because the opacity did not appear at the primary site of the tumor, which had been targeted with radiation therapy.
There have been increasing reports on cases of postCOVID-19 organizing pneumonia that progresses or reappears after the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and which responds well to corticosteroid treatment (6-10). Although bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy could not be performed due to the severe condition of the patient, the progressive pulmonary consolidation on CT and good response to corticosteroids in the present case are compatible with the pathology. However, systemic manifestations, such as high fever and acute-onset respiratory and circulatory failure are

1221

rare in the previous reports on post-COVID-19 organizing pneumonia. Thus, we speculated that ICI and/or G-CSF administered for cancer treatment may have modified the course and manifestation of post-COVID-19 organizing pneumonia in the present case.
ICIs activate T cells and may suppress viral infection (11, 12); however, the incidence of early death is high in patients who developed COVID-19 immediately after ICI treatment (13). It has been demonstrated that approximately 80% of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients treated with ICIs require hospitalization for pneumonia (14). With regard to GCSF treatment, its impact on COVID-19 remains controversial. A randomized clinical trial demonstrated that, in patients with COVID-19 and lymphopenia, recombinant GCSF treatment reduced the number of patients who developed critical illness or died (15). On the other hand, a report documented three patients with underlying malignant diseases and COVID-19, who exhibited an acute worsening of hypoxemia and hypotension within 72 hours after the administration of G-CSF (16). Another patient with nasopharyngeal cancer and COVID-19 developed progressive respiratory failure 5 days after the administration of G-CSF (17). Two retrospective, observational studies of cancer patients with neutropenia and COVID-19 demonstrated that the administration of G-CSF was positively associated with hospitalization, respiratory failure, and death (18, 19). These studies demonstrated that a longer duration of treatment and higher response to G-CSF was associated with poor outcomes (18, 19). G-CSF mobilizes not only neutrophils, but also various subsets of lymphocytes (20), which may lead to the deterioration of post-COVID-19 organizing pneumonia.
Interestingly, the patient has maintained a good partial response, despite the discontinuation of lung cancer treatment since his recovery from COVID-19. Spontaneous tumor regression has been reported to occur in 1 per 14,000 cancer cases, and has been linked to tuberculosis, influenza virus infection, and other infectious diseases (21, 22). Although the SARS-CoV-2 infection was aggravated by ICI treatment, the infection may have enhanced the effects of ICI on tumor regression.
Conclusion
Patients undergoing immunochemotherapy for carcinoma are at high risk for severe COVID-19 due to multiple factors, including hypercoagulability and chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression. Physicians should also be aware that ICI and/or G-CSF can cause overactivation of the immune system and may worsen COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 organizing pneumonia.

43 Abstract
44 The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein is synthesized as large precursor protein and 45 must be activated by proteolytic cleavage into S1 and S2. A recombinant modified vaccinia 46 virus Ankara (MVA) expressing native, full-length S protein (MVA-SARS-2-S) is 47 currently under investigation as candidate vaccine in phase I clinical studies. Initial 48 results from immunogenicity monitoring revealed induction of S-specific antibodies 49 binding to S2, but low-level antibody responses to the S1 domain. Follow-up investigations 50 of native S antigen synthesis in MVA-SARS-2-S infected cells revealed limited levels of S1 51 protein on the cell surface. In contrast, we found superior S1 cell surface presentation 52 upon infection with a recombinant MVA expressing a stabilized version of SARS-CoV-2 53 S protein with an inactivated S1/2 cleavage site and K986P and V987P mutations 54 (MVA-SARS-2-ST). When comparing immunogenicity of MVA vector vaccines, mice 55 vaccinated with MVA-SARS-2-ST mounted substantial levels of S broadly reactive 56 antibodies that effectively neutralized different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Importantly, 57 intramuscular MVA-SARS-2-ST immunization of hamsters and mice resulted in potent 58 immune responses upon challenge infection and protected from disease and severe lung 59 pathology. Our results suggest that MVA-SARS-2-ST represents an improved clinical 60 candidate vaccine and that the presence of plasma membrane-bound S1 is highly 61 beneficial to induce protective antibody levels.

66 Introduction
67 All COVID-19 vaccines licensed to date include the complete SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein 68 as key antigen to elicit protective immune responses. Trimers of this large viral surface protein 69 form the distinctive spikes of the coronavirus (1). Monomeric S is a glycosylated 70 transmembrane protein comprising a large N-terminal ectodomain and a short C-terminal 71 endodomain. The full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein is cleaved by a furin-like protease into 72 two almost equally sized polypeptides called S1 (N-terminus of S) and S2 (membrane-anchored 73 C-terminus of S). S1 harbors the receptor binding domain (RBD) which interacts with the 74 cellular receptor molecule angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serves, together with 75 other parts of S1, as an important target for antibodies that can interfere with host cell receptor 76 binding capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The S2 mediates fusion between the 77 virus and cell membrane, and is also an important target for antibodies that can interfere with 78 virus entry.
79 S-specific virus-neutralizing antibodies are a major component of the vaccine-induced immune 80 response protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection (2). COVID-19 vaccines with reported 81 efficacy deliver as an antigen either native S polypeptides (3-5) or modified versions of the full82 length S protein (6-9). The modified S antigens contain two proline amino acid substitutions in 83 the S2 protein between the fusion peptide and the first hinge region sequence to arrest the S 84 protein in the pre-fusion conformation (1). Two S vaccine antigens harbor additional mutations 85 to prevent S1/S2 cleavage by furin-like proteases (6, 8). While all of the different candidate 86 vaccines based on S antigens elicit protective immunity in humans, they seem to induce distinct 87 levels of vaccine efficacy and S-specific antibody responses (10). Structural features of the 88 various S antigens might account for these differences in vaccine immunogenicity and/or 89 vaccine efficacy and warrant further investigation. Moreover, recent studies demonstrated that 90 the persistency of immune responses induced by approved COVID-19 vaccines and/or infection
4

91 is limited. While all approved vaccine candidates provide a high level of protection against 92 severe disease and death, protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or transmission 93 declines due to the waning of S-specific antibodies and the emergence of variants. To address 94 this limitation, improved vaccination strategies that could be used as booster vaccines are 95 urgently needed.
96 Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a replication-deficient orthopoxvirus vaccine strain 97 has long served as an advanced vaccine technology platform for developing viral vector 98 vaccines against emerging infectious disease (10-14).
99 Recent work addressed the preclinical development of MVA vector vaccines against COVID100 19, including our candidate vaccine MVA-SARS-2-S (MVA-S) (15). Immunizations with 101 MVA-S in animal models demonstrated the safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of 102 this vector vaccine delivering the native full-length SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. Further, MVA-S 103 entered phase 1a clinical evaluation to assess the clinical safety and tolerability of two 104 administrations and two ascending dose levels in healthy adults (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 105 NCT04569383).
106 One objective of this study was to more closely examine the S-specific antibody responses 107 following MVA-S immunization. Preliminary data from this immunogenicity monitoring 108 suggested that most of the vaccine-induced native S-antigen-specific antibodies bound to the 109 S2 but not the S1 antigen domain. This interesting observation prompted us to construct a 110 vaccine vector delivering a modified stabilized version of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen, with an 111 inactivated S1/2 cleavage site, called MVA-SARS-2-ST (for stabilized S antigen, MVA-ST) to 112 compare with the original MVA-S in preclinical studies.
113 Here, we show that MVA-ST produces a full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein that is not 114 processed into S1 and S2 protein subunits, but anchored to the membrane of MVA-ST infected

115 cells. We found enhanced levels of cell-surface S1 antigen upon infection with MVA-ST 116 compared to MVA-S. Moreover, when comparatively tested as a vaccine in animal models, 117 MVA-ST not only elicited substantially higher levels of S1 binding and SARS-CoV-2 118 neutralizing antibodies, but also robustly protected vaccinated mice and hamsters against 119 SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection and lung pathology. Currently, MVA-ST is being 120 investigated in a phase Ib clinical trial as an optimized MVA vector candidate vaccine against 121 COVID-19.

137 Antibody response against different spike protein domains in human volunteers 138 vaccinated with MVA-S.
139 The MVA-based candidate vaccine MVA-S, encoding an unmodified, full-length SARS-CoV140 2 spike protein, is being tested in a phase 1a clinical study. This involved a prime-boost 141 intramuscular vaccination schedule comparing low-dose (107 infectious units (IU)) vs. high 142 dose (108 IU). The full prime-boost vaccination regimen was administered to 30 participants at 143 an interval of 28 days. We collected blood from these individuals at several time points, 144 including before vaccination (d0), after the first vaccination (d28) and at two time points after 145 the second vaccination (d42, d84).
146 To characterize the antigen binding capacities of the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, we 147 performed a high throughput, automated bead-based multiplex assay called Multi-CoV-Ab (16, 148 17), where four different SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens (trimeric full-length spike protein 149 (Spike Trimer); receptor-binding domain (RBD); S1 domain (S1), and S2 domain (S2)) are 150 expressed and immobilized on LUMINEX MAGPLEX beads. Seroconversion was estimated 151 by a comparison relative to a calibrator sample. To examine MVA-S-induced seroconversion, 152 we used the Trimer antigen assay (Figure 1A). All individuals vaccinated with the low dose 153 mounted low levels of trimer-binding antibodies that peaked on day 42, with a mean titer 154 expressed by 787.7 median fluorescence intensity (MFI). 33.3% (n=5/15) of the individuals 155 reached antibody titers relevant for seroconversion. In the high dose vaccination group, we 156 detected marginally increased trimer-specific antibody responses with a mean titer of 1274 MFI 157 peaking two weeks after the second vaccine dose, and also 33.3% (n=5/15) of the individuals 158 seroconverted (Figure 1A).

159 When evaluating serum reactivity against the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein we found 160 markedly lower quantities of antigen-binding antibodies (Figure 1B). Only 26.7% (n=4/15) of 161 the vaccinees receiving the high dose immunization produced an anti-RBD response (with a 162 peak mean titer of 232.9 MFI on day 42), and of these, only 2 individuals reached elevated 163 RBD-specific antibody levels compared to the calibrator. In the sera from low dose vaccinees, 164 we did not detect any RBD-specific antibodies.
165 Analyzing the IgG response directed against the S1 and S2 subdomains of the SARS-CoV-2 166 spike protein (Figure 1, C and D) revealed marginal levels of S1-specific antibodies in a few 167 individuals only, irrespective of the dosage used for vaccination (Figure 1C). In contrast, we 168 measured substantial quantities of S2-binding antibodies in sera from all vaccinees, irrespective 169 of the dosage used for vaccination (Figure 1D). Again, seroconversion was estimated by 170 comparison relative to a calibrator sample. To avoid any false positive results due to extensive 171 background fluorescence associated with the S2-subdomain, we determined cut-off values at 2172 fold day 0 MFI. The S2-specific antibody response peaked on day 84 in the low dose group, 173 with a mean titer of 4206.5 MFI. In the high dose group, half of the vaccinees exhibited a peak 174 on day 42 (mean titer of 3271.2 MFI), whereas the rest developed steadily increasing levels of 175 SARS-CoV-2-S2-binding antibodies until day 84 (mean of 2928.9 MFI). Altogether, these 176 results indicated that vaccination with the candidate vaccine MVA-S expressing a full-length 177 unmodified spike protein predominantly induces a S2-specific antibody response in humans.
178 Generation and characterization of the modified candidate vaccine MVA-ST.
179 To investigate the possible impact of fusogenic activity and proteolytic cleavage of the native 180 full-length S protein delivered by MVA-S, we generated a matching MVA vector vaccine 181 producing a modified version of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen, MVA-ST. To obtain an S-antigen 182 stabilized in a pre-fusion conformation we introduced five amino acid (aa) exchanges within 183 the 1273 aa S polypeptide, inactivating the S1/S2 furin cleavage site and creating two new
8

184 proline residues (K986P, V987P) between the first heptad repeat (HR1) and the central helix of 185 the S2 protein (Supplemental Figure 1, A-C). The recombinant virus MVA-ST was clonally 186 isolated in plaque purifications in DF-1 cell cultures and PCR analyses of the viral genome 187 confirmed the genetic integrity and genetic stability of the vector virus (Supplemental Figure 188 1, D-G). The suitability of MVA-ST for production at industrial scale under conditions of 189 biosafety level 1 was indicated by data from growth testing in DF-1 producer cells and in cell 190 lines of human origin (Supplemental Figure 2).
191 Synthesis of the stabilized ST antigen in MVA-ST infected cell cultures was demonstrated by 192 Western blot analysis, which confirmed the absence of proteolytic cleavage. A single protein 193 band with a molecular mass of 190 kDa was detected in cells infected with MVA-ST using 194 either S1- or S2-specific monoclonal antibodies (Figure 2, A and B). In contrast, lysates from 195 cells infected with the original recombinant virus MVA-S contained additional protein bands 196 that migrated at molecular masses corresponding to the sizes of the S1 and S2 cleavage 197 products.
198 Next, we used immunofluorescence staining with S2-specific primary antibodies to assess cell 199 surface expression and trafficking of the different S proteins in Vero cells infected with MVA200 ST compared to cells infected with MVA-S (Figure 2C). Similar to our findings with MVA-S, 201 we observed a reticular pattern with juxtanuclear accumulation of the stabilized S protein in 202 permeabilized and MVA-ST infected cells. Immunostaining without cell permeabilization 203 specifically revealed abundant S2 protein on the cell surface of either MVA-S or MVA-ST 204 infected cells.
205 To comparatively analyze and quantify predicted cellular localization of the S1 and S2 subunits 206 by confocal microscopy, we infected Huh-7 cells with either MVA-S or MVA-ST (Figure 2, D 207 and E). Infected cells were fixed 18 hpi and S located at the cell surface was labeled prior to 208 fixation using an anti-S1 human-derived monoclonal antibody (18). Subsequently, cells were
9

209 fixed, permeabilized and total S was labeled using an anti-S2 antibody from mouse and 210 secondary Alexa Fluor 488-/594-conjugated antibodies (18). As anticipated, we saw a similar 211 staining pattern for both recombinant viruses using S2-specific antibodies, indicating 212 comparable amounts of S2 protein on the cell surface of both MVA-S and MVA-ST infected 213 cells.
214 In MVA-ST infected cells, the S1-specific immunostaining also revealed ample amounts of S1 215 protein on the cell surface. Surprisingly, and in contrast, we observed significantly lower levels 216 of S1-specific cell surface staining in MVA-S-infected cells (Figure 2, D and E). Likewise, 217 analyzing infected cells for S1 cell surface expression using immunostaining and FACS 218 analysis detected significantly lower levels of S1 cell surface expression in cells infected with 219 MVA-S (14.4%), in contrast to S1-specific staining in 34.5% of viable human A549 cells 220 infected with MVA-ST. This was also confirmed when analyzing the fold change in S1 MFI 221 relative to mock in the live cell compartment (0.61-fold change for MVA-S, 2.40-fold change 222 for MVA-ST, Figure 2F).
223 MVA-ST induced S-specific immune responses in BALB/c mice.
224 To comparatively assess vaccine safety and immunogenicity, we vaccinated BALB/c mice 225 intramuscularly with 108 PFU of MVA-S or MVA-ST using a 21-day interval prime-boost 226 schedule (Supplemental Figure 3).
227 The induction of S-binding antibodies was analyzed by ELISA using different SARS-CoV-2-S 228 polypeptides as target antigens (full-length S, RBD, S1, or S2) (Figure 3, A-D). Initially, we 229 confirmed seroconversion by ELISA using wells coated with purified trimeric S protein. 230 Seroconversion was detected in 100% of vaccinated mice after prime-boost vaccination, with a 231 mean titer of 1:1125 for MVA-S and 1:1200 for MVA-ST (Figure 3A). All MVA-ST 232 immunized mice already mounted antibodies binding to RBD on day 18, with a mean titer of
10

233 1:1500 (Figure 3B). Only 16.7% (n=1/6) of MVA-S vaccinated animals produced measurable 234 amounts of RBD-specific antibodies, with a titer of 1:300. Boost vaccination on day 21 resulted 235 in lower levels of RBD-specific antibodies following MVA-S vaccination, with a mean titer of 236 1:1850, than the significantly increased levels induced by MVA-ST vaccination (mean titer of 237 1:30375).
238 In S1-ELISA assays, we found no or only low-level responses in sera of vaccinated mice after 239 prime immunization (Figure 3C). 37.5% (n=3/8) of mice vaccinated with MVA-ST mounted 240 S1-binding antibodies with a mean titer of 1:100. However, substantial levels of S1-binding 241 antibodies developed after the boost vaccination with MVA-ST, with a mean titer of 1:6075; in 242 contrast, mice that received MVA-S developed a significantly lower titer of 1:337. Marginal 243 levels of antibodies binding to S2-protein were measured after a single vaccination with MVA244 S or MVA-ST (Figure 3D). Boost vaccination significantly increased the amounts of S2245 binding antibodies for both candidate vaccines, with a mean titer of 1:728 for MVA-ST and 246 1:1350 for MVA-S vaccinated animals.
247 In addition, we analyzed antibody binding capacity against the Beta variant of SARS-CoV-2 248 using ELISA plates coated with synthetic Beta SARS-CoV-2 S-protein (Figure 3E). A single 249 MVA-S vaccination did not result in obvious levels of binding antibodies, whereas mice 250 vaccinated with MVA-ST mounted detectable levels of binding antibodies with a mean titer of 251 1:143. After boost vaccination, MVA-S vaccinated mice did show activation of antibodies 252 specific for the Beta variant spike protein, with a mean titer of 1:116. However, MVA-ST 253 booster immunization significantly increased these antibody levels, with mean titers of 1:3825.
254 To evaluate neutralizing antibodies, we performed PRNT50 as well as VNT100 assays (Figure 255 4). Immunization with MVA-S induced low levels of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS256 CoV-2 isolate Germany/BavPat1/2020 (henceforth called SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1), reaching a 257 mean titer of 1:3437 in the more sensitive PRNT50 assay and a mean titer of 1:81 in the more
11

258 demanding VNT100 assay (Figure 4, A and B). In comparison, MVA-ST prime-boost 259 vaccination resulted in significantly better SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 neutralization, with mean 260 titers of 1:6400 in PRNT50 and 1:848 in VNT100 assays (Figure 4, A and B).
261 Our candidate vaccines are based on the spike protein sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate 262 Wuhan HU-1 from 2020 (15). Thus, we used the mouse sera generated above to evaluate the 263 capacity of the antibody responses to neutralize infections with SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha 264 (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351) and Zeta (P.2) using the VNT100 assay (Figure 4C). Similar to previous 265 findings using this assay, MVA-S vaccination resulted in low levels of detectable neutralizing 266 antibodies against the original SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 (geometric mean titer 31). In accordance 267 with these results, only a few mice mounted neutralizing responses against the SARS-CoV-2 268 variants Alpha (2/6, mean titer of 1:46), Beta (1/6, mean titer of 1:8) and Zeta (1/6, mean titer 269 1:31). In sharp contrast, MVA-ST vaccination elicited robust levels of circulating antibodies 270 that neutralized the original SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 (6/6, mean titer of 1:1874) and the variant 271 viruses Alpha (6/6, mean titer of 1:1761), Beta (6/6, mean titer of 1:1002) and Zeta (6/6, mean 272 titer of 1:824).
273 To characterize the neutralizing capacities against the more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants Delta 274 (B.1.617.2) and the highly contagious Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), we again performed prime275 boost vaccination in BALB/c mice as above (Figure 4, D and E). Control mice that had been 276 either mock or non-recombinant MVA vaccinated did not mount any neutralizing antibodies 277 against Delta or Omicron. MVA-S vaccinated mice mounted low levels of Delta neutralizing 278 antibodies with a mean titer of 1:90. In contrast MVA-ST vaccination resulted in robust 279 activation of Delta neutralizing antibodies with a mean titer of 1:275. When analyzing 280 neutralization against Omicron, MVA-S vaccinated mice showed low titers resulting in a mean 281 titer of 1:8, compared to MVA-ST vaccinated mice, with a mean of 1:184. To ensure 282 comparability with the BALB/c vaccination experiments above, PRNT50 against the BavPat1
12

283 isolate was performed (Supplemental Figure 4). Altogether, these results indicate that 284 immunization with MVA-ST induces a superior anti-SARS-CoV-2-S humoral response 285 resulting in the generation of cross-neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2-S antibodies against all the 286 variants tested so far: Alpha, Beta, Zeta, Delta and Omicron.
287 To characterize the activation of SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immunity following prime288 boost vaccination in BALB/c mice, we monitored S1 epitope-specific CD8+ T cells using IFN289  ELISPOT assays and FACS analysis (Figure 5). Boost vaccinations with MVA-S activated 290 substantial numbers of S268-276 epitope-specific CD8+ T cells with mean numbers of 1571 IFN291  spot forming cells (SFC) in 106 splenocytes (Figure 5A). Comparable results were obtained 292 for boost vaccinations with MVA-ST (mean of 1349 IFN- SFC; Figure 5A). In agreement with 293 these data, FACS analysis of T cells stimulated in vitro with peptide S268-276 and stained for 294 intracellular IFN- showed robust frequencies of IFN- positive CD8+ T cells in splenocytes 295 from mice immunized with MVA-S (means of 1.51%) or MVA-ST (means of 1.53%) compared 296 to mock-vaccinated control mice (means of 0.01%) (Figure 5, B and C). Substantial numbers 297 of the activated IFN-+ CD8+ T cells also co-expressed TNF- (81% for MVA-S and 79% for 298 MVA-ST; Figure 5D). Of note, mice immunized with MVA-S or MVA-ST mounted similar 299 levels of SARS-2-S-specific CD8+ T cells and MVA-specific CD8+ T cells (Supplemental 300 Figure 5).
301 Protective capacity of MVA-S and MVA-ST upon SARS-CoV-2 respiratory challenge in 302 Syrian hamsters.
303 To further investigate the impact of prime-boost immunization against SARS-CoV-2-induced 304 disease, we used Syrian hamsters as a well-established preclinical model for efficacy testing 305 (Figure 6 and Figure 7). Two cohorts of hamsters were vaccinated within a 21-day interval 306 twice intramuscularly with 108 PFU candidate vaccine in each case, comparing MVA and 307 MVA-S then MVA and MVA-ST. Safety and immunogenicity were analyzed as established
13

308 before (Supplemental Figure 6). SARS-CoV-2-binding antibodies were analyzed by different 309 ELISA assays specific for trimeric S protein or S1 subunit antigen. Immunizations with non310 recombinant vector elicited no detectable S-specific antibodies in control hamsters (MVA; 311 Figure 6A). However, antibodies specific to trimeric S proteins could be detected in all hamsters 312 vaccinated with MVA-S (mean titer 1: 700) or MVA-ST (mean titer 1:728) already after single 313 vaccination. Boost vaccinations further increased the levels, resulting in comparable titers of 314 1:2250 for MVA-S and 1:1157 for MVA-ST vaccination. 315 Underlining the mouse model results, we observed a different pattern for vaccine-induced S1316 binding antibodies. Only 37.5% (n=3/8) of MVA-S vaccinated hamsters mounted S1-binding 317 antibodies after the first immunization (mean titer of 1:38), while boost vaccinations elicited 318 low-level seroconversion in 87.5% (n=7/8) of MVA-S vaccinated animals (mean titer of 1:112). 319 In sharp contrast, prime MVA-ST vaccination induced high levels of S1-binding antibodies 320 (100% seroconversion, mean titer of 1:2442), and boost vaccination on day 21 further increased 321 these levels to a mean titer of 1:4242 (Figure 6B). 322 Similarly, after prime immunization we measured low levels of SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1323 neutralizing antibodies in sera from 87.5% (n=7/8) of MVA-S vaccinated hamsters (mean titer 324 of 1:65, Figure 6C), whereas all hamsters immunized with MVA-ST mounted readily detectable 325 neutralizing antibodies (100% seroconversion) with an average titer of 1:321 PRNT50 at 3 326 weeks after priming (Figure 6C). 327 Compared to SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1, reduced neutralizing activity against Delta and Omicron 328 were measured. MVA-S vaccination resulted in marginal antibody titers neutralizing Delta 329 (mean titer of 1:71, Figure 6D). No detectable titers against Omicron were measured after prime 330 MVA-S vaccination (Figure 6E). Hamsters that had been vaccinated with MVA-ST mounted a 331 mean titer of 1:185.7 against Delta (Figure 6D) and a titer below the detection limit against 332 Omicron (mean titer of 1:33.9, Figure 6E). After the boost vaccination, sera from all MVA-S 333 vaccinated hamsters (100% seroconversion) revealed low neutralizing activity with minor titers
14

334 of about 1:100 PRNT50 against SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 (Figure 6C). One out of 7 animals 335 confirmed seroconversion against Delta, exhibiting a mean titer of 1:67 after boost vaccination 336 (Figure 6D). In MVA-S vaccinated animals no seroconversion was detected against Omicron 337 (Figure 6E). In contrast, in all sera from hamsters vaccinated with MVA-ST we detected 338 increased amounts of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 after 339 the boost immunization, with a mean titer of 1:529 PRNT50 (Figure 6C). For Delta a mean titer 340 of 1:500 was measured in these vaccinated animals (100% seroconversion, Figure 6D), whereas 341 no obvious titers of Omicron neutralizing antibodies were detected in MVA-ST animals (mean 342 titer of 1:46, Figure 6E). 343 Four weeks after the boost immunization, the animals were intranasally infected with 104 344 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 (Figure 7). Starting on day 3, MVA vaccinated control hamsters 345 demonstrated reduced body weights, and at 6 dpi all animals had lost approximately 10% of 346 their initial body weight. No body weight loss could be detected for hamsters immunized with 347 MVA-S or MVA-ST (Figure 7A). Control animals also showed characteristic clinical 348 symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 respiratory tract infection, including labored 349 breathing, reduced activity and scruffy fur. No MVA-S or MVA-ST vaccinated animals showed 350 any signs of clinical disease (Figure 7B). 351 To evaluate virus loads and pathological changes in lung tissues, we euthanized all animals at 352 6 dpi. Blood and swab samples were taken at necropsy, and lungs were harvested for further 353 analysis. Substantial amounts of viral RNA were detected in oropharyngeal swabs of control 354 animals (mean of 7.7x103 RNA copy numbers/µl, Figure 7C). Swab samples from hamsters 355 vaccinated with MVA-S contained marginally reduced levels of viral RNA (on average 3x103 356 RNA copy numbers/µl), whereas swabs from animals vaccinated with MVA-ST contained 357 significantly reduced levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (mean of 1.6x103 RNA copy numbers/µl, 358 Figure 7C).
15

359 Correspondingly, lung tissues from control hamsters harbored infectious SARS-CoV-2 (mean 360 of 2.9x103 TCID50/gram lung tissue; Figure 7D), whereas no infectious SARS-CoV-2 was 361 detected in the lungs of vaccinated hamsters (with the exception of tissue from one MVA-S 362 vaccinated animal containing 5.6x102 TCID50/gram lung tissue). These data were confirmed by 363 real-time RT-PCR analysis of virus RNA loads. In lung tissues from both MVA-S and MVA364 ST-immunized animals, we found lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA compared to control 365 hamsters (<3x101genome equivalents/ng total RNA; Figure 7E). 366 Only after SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 infection we did detect SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies in 367 control (MVA) hamsters with a mean titer of 1:16883 for S specific antibodies and 1:5600 for 368 S1 binding antibodies (Supplemental Figure 7, A and B). Thus, although all the control 369 hamsters became moribund, we observed detectable titers of SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 370 neutralizing antibodies that averaged to 1:632 by PRNT50 after challenge infection (Figure 7F). 371 Against Delta an average mean titer of 1:1013 was measured in control MVA-vaccinated 372 hamsters (Figure 7G). Lower titers reaching a mean of 1:204 were present against Omicron 373 detected by PRNT50 (Figure 7H). In line with data from viral load and clinical disease outcome, 374 we detected markedly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2-S specific antibodies in sera from 375 immunized hamsters. After challenge, we measured substantial levels of S binding antibodies 376 with mean titers of 1:38185 or 1:50194 after MVA-S or MVA-ST immunization (Supplemental 377 Figure 7B). S1 binding antibodies in MVA-S vaccinated hamsters reached a mean titer of 378 1:23528; MVA-ST vaccinated hamsters had a higher mean titer of 1:72900 (Supplemental 379 Figure 7A). MVA-S vaccination resulted in SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 neutralizing activities with 380 average PRNT50 titers of 1:1200, compared to MVA-ST mean titers of 1:1771 (Figure 7F). In 381 MVA-S vaccinated hamsters, a mean titer of 1:1475 against Delta and 1:468 against Omicron 382 were detected (Figure 7, G and H). After MVA-ST vaccination, hamsters mounted mean titers 383 of 1:1714 neutralizing Delta and 1:714 against Omicron (Figure 7, G and H).
16

384 To evaluate lung pathology in vaccinated and infected animals, we performed histological 385 analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained lung sections (Figure 8). Control hamsters (MVA) 386 had large areas of lung consolidation. Alveolar lesions were characterized by the accumulation 387 of neutrophils and mononuclear cells that expanded alveolar septae and filled alveolar lumina 388 (Figure 8, A and E). Inflammation was associated with necrosis of alveolar epithelia, fibrin 389 exudation and a prominent pneumocyte type II hyperplasia. A mixed inflammatory infiltrate, 390 epithelial degeneration and hyperplasia were found in bronchi and bronchioli. In addition, 391 animals showed marked vascular lesions, characterized by endothelial hypertrophy, 392 endothelialitis, mural and perivascular infiltrates, loss of vascular wall integrity, and 393 perivascular edema. 394 MVA-S vaccinated hamsters also revealed areas of inflammation and consolidation, although 395 the overall extent of alveolar, bronchial/bronchiolar and vascular lesions was less than in control 396 animals (Figure 8C). Lungs of MVA-ST vaccinated hamsters showed negligible or markedly 397 reduced lung pathology (Figure 8G). Almost all the animals in this group demonstrated only 398 mild to moderate inflammatory lesions confined to the airways and some vessels, while alveolar 399 lesions were absent or minimal, affecting less than 1% of the lung lobes. Only one animal 400 showed higher lesion scores in the alveolar and vascular compartment, affecting below 25% of 401 the entire lobe. 402 Semiquantitative scoring of alveolar, airway and vascular lesions showed a significant 403 reduction in all parameters in animals vaccinated with recombinant MVA vaccines compared 404 to the control group (Figure 8I). Importantly, MVA-ST vaccinated hamsters showed 405 substantially lower inflammation scores than MVA-S vaccinated animals. Using 406 immunohistochemistry, SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was detected in the lungs of all control 407 hamsters, but in none of the MVA-S or MVA-ST immunized animals (Figure 8, J and K). 408 MVA-S or MVA-ST vaccination provides protection from lethal SARS-CoV-2 disease 409 outcomes in K18-hACE2 mice.
17

410 To evaluate immunogenicity and protective efficacy in a lethal animal model, we used K18411 hACE2 mice. K18-hACE2 mice are highly susceptible to intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection 412 characterized through high viral loads in the lungs, severe interstitial pneumonia, and death by 413 day 6 or 8 post inoculation. Mice were vaccinated with MVA, MVA-S or MVA-ST using an 414 intramuscular prime-boost schedule as above.
415 As expected, we did not measure SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 neutralizing antibodies in control mice 416 vaccinated with MVA. Single vaccination with MVA-S or MVA-ST resulted in obvious titers 417 of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 with a mean titer of 1:880 for MVA418 S and 1:2880 for MVA-ST. Boost vaccination on day 21 further increased SARS-CoV-2 419 BavPat1 neutralizing antibodies to mean titers of 1:660 or 1:3840 in MVA-S or MVA-ST 420 vaccinated mice (Figure 9A). However, neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 Delta and 421 Omicron were lower compared to SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 following MVA-S and MVA-ST 422 vaccination (Figure 9, B and C).
423 Mice immunized with MVA-S mounted sufficient levels of Delta neutralizing antibodies after 424 prime or boost application (Figure 9B, mean of 1:208 or 1:575). MVA-ST vaccination resulted 425 in a mean titer of 1:675 after prime and 1:1400 after boost (Figure 9B). For Omicron, no 426 detectable titers of neutralizing antibodies were present in mice after single vaccination with 427 either candidate vaccine. MVA-S boost vaccination again did not result in obvious titers of 428 Omicron neutralizing antibodies (Figure 9C). Marginal titers of Omicron neutralizing 429 antibodies were present in sera of mice after boost vaccination with MVA-ST (Figure 9C, mean 430 titer of 1:75).
431 At 4 weeks after boost vaccinations, mice were intranasally challenged with a lethal dose of 432 3.6x104 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1. Control mice significantly lost weight and showed 433 clinical signs of disease starting on day 3, all succumbed to infection by day 6, whereas MVA434 S and MVA-ST vaccinated mice showed no weight loss or clinical disease (Figure 9, D-F). At
18

435 4 days post infection, substantial levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper 436 respiratory tract of control vaccinated mice (mean of 6.6x103 genome equivalents /µl). In MVA437 S vaccinated mice, we detected low but detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in 438 oropharyngeal swabs (mean of 27 genome equivalents /µl). MVA-ST vaccinated mice did not 439 produce detectable viral RNA levels in oropharyngeal swabs (Figure 9G).
440 When monitoring virus loads in the lung and brain homogenates of mice at times of death (day 441 6 pi (MVA vaccinated mice) or 8 days post-challenge (MVA-S/MVA-ST vaccinated animals)), 442 we failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 in the lungs and brains of MVA-S or MVA-ST 443 vaccinated mice, but found large amounts of infectious virus in the organs from control MVA444 vaccinated mice (Figure 9H). These data were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR analysis of virus 445 RNA loads. In the control MVA vaccinated mice, we detected substantial levels of viral RNA 446 with a mean of 1.19x107 or 1.14x108 genome equivalents/ng total RNA in lungs or brains. Both 447 MVA-S and MVA-ST-immunized animals exhibited lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA than 448 in control mice in the lungs (a mean of 3.7x102 genome equivalents/ng total RNA for MVA-S 449 and 1.31 for MVA-ST; Figure 7I) and in the brains (a mean of 9.73 genome equivalents/ng total 450 RNA for MVA-S and 1.58 for MVA-ST).
451 Neutralizing antibodies against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1, SARS-CoV-2 Delta and 452 Omicron were analyzed at the end of the experiment. Marginal titers of BavPat1- and Delta453 neutralizing antibodies were present in sera of control MVA vaccinated mice after SARS-CoV454 2 BavPat1 challenge infection (mean of 1:420 for BavPat1, mean of 1:168.75 for Delta; Figure 455 9, J and K). No titers of Omicron neutralizing antibodies were found in MVA vaccinated 456 animals (Figure 9L). However, robust titers of neutralizing antibodies were present in sera of 457 MVA-S and MVA-ST vaccinated mice after SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 challenge infection (Figure 458 9, J-L): Against BavPat1, MVA-S vaccination resulted in a mean titer of 1:2240; MVA-ST 459 vaccination resulted in an even higher mean titer of 1:5600.
19

460 Against Delta, MVA-S vaccination resulted in a mean titer of 1:1333. Confirming previous 461 results, antibody levels in MVA-ST vaccinated mice were markedly higher with mean titers of 462 1:2400. However, against Omicron, a lower mean titer of 1:133 was measured for both 463 candidate vaccines (Figure 9L).
464 Consistent with data from viral load in the lungs, control MVA vaccinated animals showed 465 pronounced lung pathology, which was associated with moderate to severe perivascular edema 466 and inflammation comprising lymphocytes, macrophages and small numbers of neutrophils 467 surrounding small and intermediate vessels. Considerable inflammatory changes were also 468 found in the alveolar and peribronchiolar compartments, characterized by moderate to marked 469 interstitial and luminal immune cell infiltrates with multifocal areas of completely obscured 470 alveolar architecture. In animals vaccinated with MVA-S, despite the absence of severe and 471 widespread inflammation in the alveolar compartment, substantial perivascular and 472 peribronchiolar inflammation was also present in the lungs. Interestingly, MVA-ST vaccinated 473 mice showed only very mild signs of pulmonary lesions after SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 challenge 474 infection (Figure 10). Our data so far showed that robust protective vaccination by a prime475 boost application of 108 PFU MVA candidate vaccines is associated with substantial titers of 476 neutralizing antibodies in K18-hACE2 mice.

483 Discussion 484 Here, we report that vaccination with a pre-fusion, stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S protein (ST) 485 expressed by recombinant MVA (MVA-ST) elicits a better humoral immune response and 486 provides protection upon SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 challenge infection compared to the original 487 recombinant MVA vaccine delivering the non-modified SARS-CoV-2 S antigen (MVA-S).
488 Although several approved vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are currently available, COVID-19 489 vaccine development still remains an important goal due to unsolved questions such as 490 longevity and duration of immunity, virus transmission after asymptomatic infection, and 491 arising virus variants of concern, VOC. Thus, the development of innovative vaccination 492 modalities that also confer robust and more broadly effective protection are urgently required. 493 In general, there are several strategies to further improve vaccine candidates. A promising 494 approach includes the presentation of a selected antigen. This may be of importance when 495 processable fusion proteins are used as immunogens in vaccine development, since their 496 metastability or processing also affects the kinetics of immune responses.
497 Based on our positive experience using a non-modified S protein for generating a MVA-based 498 candidate vaccine against MERS-CoV (11), we initially decided to use the same strategy to 499 develop a COVID-19 candidate vaccine. Our MVA-S candidate vaccine expressing the 500 authentic 2019 Wuhan Hu-1 S protein was confirmed to be immunogenic and protective in 501 preclinical evaluation when tested in a mouse model for COVID-19 (15). Comparable results 502 have been reported from the Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, which also 503 expresses a non-stabilized S protein and was confirmed to be immunogenic and protective in 504 different preclinical animal models (19-21). Of note, the Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV505 19 was approved as a COVID-19 vaccine for application in humans and more than two billion 506 doses of the vaccine have already been administered (22, 23).
21

507 In this current study we report on the evaluation of the COVID-19 candidate vector vaccine 508 MVA-S in a phase Ia clinical trial in humans. Here, we again confirmed advantageous safety 509 and tolerability (data not shown). However, preliminary results revealed a pattern of antibody 510 responses in individuals vaccinated with high or low doses of MVA-S, indicating a low S1511 specific antibody response irrespective of vaccine dosage, while these individuals mounted 512 substantial titers of S2 binding antibodies. Overall, levels of S-specific antibodies were shown 513 to be below the levels of a comparable study evaluating a MVA-based candidate vaccine against 514 MERS-CoV (11).
515 A recent study indicated that the efficiency of furin mediated cleavage in the S1/S2 polybasic 516 cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is enhanced compared to MERS-CoV (24). From these 517 preliminary in vitro results, we hypothesize that a lower furin-mediated cleavage in MERS518 CoV-S protein expressed by MVA results in S protein that is still maintained in a prefusion 519 state, still allowing S1 specific immune response activation. Since our recent data suggested 520 proper folding and authentic presentation of the trimeric spike protein expressed by MVA 521 vector virus (15), we hypothesized that processing involving furin-mediated cleavage of the S 522 protein into its membrane associated S2 subunit and the distal S1 subunit also occurs. 523 Proteolytic cleavage can be followed by shedding of S1 leaving the S2 subunit anchored within 524 the membrane (25). Our results again confirmed the authentic processing of the non-modified 525 spike protein with prominent S2 expression on the cell surface and obvious S1 shedding.
526 In previous studies, betacoronavirus S1 shedding had already been observed to inadvertently 527 influence the activation of S-specific antibodies (6, 26, 27). This has also been confirmed for 528 the activation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies after vaccination with the Oxford529 AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. The authors discuss that the shedding of cleaved S1 530 may contribute to a higher proportion of non-neutralizing relative to neutralizing antibodies 531 (28). This is in line with data from a recent study where Barros-Martins and colleagues
22

532 evaluated the impact of heterologous versus homologous ChAdOx1nCoV-19/BNT162b2 533 vaccination in humans. Here, individuals who received a homologous BNT162b2 vaccination 534 in a prime-boost schedule showed stronger antibody responses than those receiving 535 homologous ChAdOx1nCoV-19 immunizations (29). Since BNT162b2 is based on a stabilized 536 S protein, we hypothesized that S protein presentation influences immunogenicity, and that S1 537 dissociation from S2 influences the quantity and quality of MVA-S activated immune 538 responses. In another study, Dangi and colleagues confirmed that humans vaccinated with a 539 modified S protein exhibited a cross-protective immune response against heterologous 540 coronaviruses (30).
541 Several approaches have been used to stabilize various class I fusion proteins in their pre542 cleaved conformation through structure-based design. For betacoronaviruses it has been 543 suggested that presentation of the S protein in pre- or post-fusion conformation has a substantial 544 impact on the ratio of immune responses. In previous studies, two proline substitutions at the 545 apex of the central helix and heptad repeat 1 have been identified that could effectively stabilize 546 MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and human coronavirus HKU1 S proteins in the pre-cleaved 547 conformation (27, 31, 32). Such stabilized S proteins were confirmed to be more immunogenic 548 than wild-type S proteins (33, 34).
549 To evaluate the impact of structural processing of the labile S protein using our vector platform 550 technology, we generated a MVA candidate vaccine expressing pre-cleavage stabilized S 551 (MVA-ST). Modifications of full-length SARS-CoV-2-S protein expressed by MVA have 552 already been used in other studies (26, 30, 35). As expected, when tested in vivo in mice and 553 hamsters, we observed an improved antibody response after MVA-ST vaccination compared to 554 the original MVA-S candidate vaccine. In line with previous results (36), the general activation 555 of neutralizing antibodies to variant Omicron was markedly reduced compared to ancestral
23

556 BavPat1 and variant Delta. Of note, MVA-ST vaccination still induced marginally improved 557 levels of Omicron neutralizing antibodies compared to MVA-S.
558 The pattern of antibody responses in MVA-ST immunized mice clearly exhibited advantageous 559 activation of RBD-, S1- and S2-binding antibodies. RBD is located in the S1 subunit known 560 as the S protein ectodomain, and both are involved in binding to the specific cellular receptor. 561 Thus both RBD binding antibodies and those binding S1 elsewhere contribute to efficiently 562 blocking SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding. Moreover, since the fusion peptide region is located 563 within the S2 subunit, S2-binding antibodies are important for inhibiting fusion of the viral and 564 host membranes, which enables release of the viral genome into host cells.
565 Since coronaviruses can readily generate antibody-escape mutations in the RBD and S1 subunit, 566 activation of antibodies covering the entire S protein is considered desirable to ameliorate 567 vaccine induced immunity in such events. Indeed, the effectiveness of broadly reactive 568 antibodies has already been confirmed for COVID-19 where REGN-COV2, an antibody 569 cocktail mixture containing two neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain 570 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, efficiently reduced viral load in COVID-19 patients (37). 571 Thus, the activation of antibodies targeting different epitopes within the S protein could also be 572 effective against different SARS-CoV-2 VOC. This was confirmed by our findings that, 573 compared to MVA-S vaccination, superior activation of neutralizing antibodies specific for the 574 S protein of Alpha, Beta, and Gamma virus variants and against the more recent SARS-CoV-2 575 variants Delta and Omicron, was achieved in mice and hamsters vaccinated with MVA-ST. 576 The Omicron-characteristic immune evasion is based on a high number of amino acid 577 substitutions present in the RBD. Yet, there is a fraction of broadly reactive antibodies that bind 578 to sites inside and outside the RBD and potently neutralize Omicron (38).
579 Based on previous studies from other betacoronaviruses, and also from influenza viruses, we 580 hypothesize that this broadly neutralizing capacity may be explained by abundant presentation
24

581 of the prefusion S2 conformation. S2 has been confirmed to be more highly conserved than S1, 582 and represents a promising antigen to contribute to the induction of broadly protective immunity 583 against current and newly arising coronaviruses (27, 39, 40). In our study, we confirmed more 584 prominent presentation of S2 as a pre-cleavage-stabilized cell surface protein. This S2 prefusion 585 conformation, in contrast to the post-fusion S2 structure, might also contribute to more 586 effectively activating host immune responses (41, 42) also against VOC harboring high 587 numbers of mutations in S1. We also confirmed the characteristic pattern of S-specific humoral 588 immunity when we comprehensively tested our COVID-19 candidate vaccines in K18-hACE2 589 mice and the Syrian hamster model. Interestingly, despite these obvious differences in 590 activation of humoral immune responses, the activation of a S1-specific cellular immune 591 response appeared to be comparable following MVA-S and MVA-ST vaccination in mice. In 592 our case, the S1 subunit including the presumed immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 S H2Kd 593 epitope S269-278 is required to induce S1 epitope-specific CD8+ T cells (15).
594 However, since both the S proteins are initially processed via the trans-Golgi network, direct 595 MHC-I presentation should also be efficient in activating CD8+ T cell responses specific for 596 S1 epitopes. This is further confirmed by results from Western blot analysis, which detected 597 sufficient and comparable production of S1 antigen in the cell lysates of both MVA-S candidate 598 vaccines. From these data we hypothesize that S1 is properly processed by direct antigen 599 presentation resulting in sufficient activation of S1 specific CD8+ T cells. Here it will be of 600 interest to further characterize levels of S1- and S2-epitope-specific T cells in more detail, 601 especially concerning their role in protective efficacy. A robust activation of S1 epitope 602 specific T cells should also contribute to a protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2 603 variants including Omicron that has been confirmed to efficiently evade recognition by many 604 RBD-specific antibodies. Indeed, Omicron-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses are well 605 conserved suggesting negligible immune escape at the level of cellular immunity (43).
25

606 Thus, we hypothesize that robust MVA-ST mediated protection against variant SARS-CoV-2 607 including Omicron will rely on the activation of broadly reactive antibodies targeting conserved 608 antigenic sites within the S-protein and the induction of cellular immunity.
609 Intriguingly, when we evaluated protective efficacy against intranasal SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 610 infection, the clinical outcome of both MVA-S and MVA-ST vaccinated animals appeared 611 similar, since neither group showed any weight loss or morbidity. Since the primary goal of 612 current SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and approved vaccines is to prevent symptomatic 613 COVID-19 (2), our results from the infection models indicate that both MVA-COVID 614 candidate vaccines are suitable for achieving this. Reduced morbidity is matched by reduced 615 viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract of vaccinated animals, although MVA-ST 616 appeared to increase the rate of reduction. One can surmise that significantly reducing SARS617 CoV-2 virus load in the lungs results in moderating the severity of the disease. Of note, 618 compared to the MVA-S vaccinated hamsters, those vaccinated with MVA-ST also showed 619 significantly reduced viral shedding on day 6. This might also be the result of the broader 620 reactive antibody response combined with a robust activation of neutralizing antibodies leading 621 to rapid virus control in the upper and lower respiratory tract.
622 Of particular interest, when we characterized the vaccination effect in the hamsters in more 623 detail, postmortem at 6 dpi, we found that MVA-ST vaccinated animals seemed more robustly 624 protected from lung pathology, particularly in the alveolar compartment. Diffuse alveolar 625 damage resulting from SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 infection represents a clinically relevant 626 pathomorphological lesion associated with impaired gas exchange, potentially resulting in acute 627 respiratory distress syndrome. Here, in most of the MVA-ST vaccinated animals alveolar 628 lesions were completely absent or minimal. In the MVA-S vaccinated group, the extent of 629 alveolar inflammation and damage was also reduced compared to controls, correlating with the 630 lack of clinical symptoms. However, mild to moderate lesions involving up to 25-50% of the
26

631 lung lobe were still present in all these animals, suggesting incomplete protection of these 632 tissues.
633 The absence of substantial alveolar pathology and inflammation without any SARS-2-N antigen 634 expression in the lungs of MVA-ST vaccinated hamsters favors the idea that the risk of 635 developing Long COVID is also reduced. However, this needs to be confirmed in future studies. 636 Since the K18-hACE2 mouse model recapitulates the outcome of severe COVID-19 in humans, 637 efficacy testing of SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines in the K18hACE2 SARS-CoV-2 infection 638 model is of substantial value (32, 42). We confirmed the severe and lethal disease outcome in 639 this model for mice that had been vaccinated with non-recombinant MVA. Despite the absence 640 of death, disease, and even viral load in the lungs of MVA-S vaccinated mice, substantial 641 pulmonary pathology including vasculitis and bronchitis were observed. Of note, vasculitis has 642 been also described as one of the complications of COVID-19 in humans (43).
643 In contrast, such pathological outcomes were not detected at all in mice vaccinated with MVA644 ST. However, since the severity of disease in this model is also mediated by neurological 645 involvement, both the candidate vaccines appeared to readily protect against the lethal outcome 646 of disease presumably through rapidly inhibiting initial replication in the respiratory tract (44). 647 Despite this robust protection achieved in these mice, the observed differences in the outcome 648 of pathology in this model further support the advantage of the modified S protein.
649 Vice versa, our data also indicate that authentic S processing during viral infection plays an 650 important role in terms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis as an immune evasion strategy. This 651 hypothesis is supported by our results that MVA-S immunogenicity is markedly lower than that 652 of the MVA-ST candidate vaccine. Importantly, we confirmed that a pre-cleavage, stabilized S 653 protein activates a beneficial antibody response. These data suggest that a deeper understanding 654 of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and its potential immune evasion strategies is not only
27

655 important for better understanding the viral pathogenesis, but also for developing new 656 vaccination strategies. 657 Taken together, the availability of a vaccine that not only prevents the obvious development of 658 clinical disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also avoids excessive alveolar damage, 659 inflammation, and subsequent remodeling is highly desirable. 660 Here, we confirmed the improved efficacy of MVA-ST in preclinical models. These findings 661 merit clinical studies using the MVA-ST candidate vaccine to further characterize the immune 662 responses in humans, not only in homologous immunization cohorts but also in heterologous 663 schedules using mRNA or adenovirus vectors as primary vaccinations. It will also be of 664 particular interest to evaluate how long protective immune responses are maintained and 665 whether broader protection can be achieved. These studies are important due to the still ongoing 666 pandemic and the fact that we still lack data on the impact of vaccine-induced immune-response 667 durability on protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676

678 Study design and participants.
679 A phase 1 clinical trial was conducted to address safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine 680 candidate MVA-S in healthy adults (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04569383). The study 681 was conducted in Hamburg (Germany) at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf 682 (UKE). Study participants were divided into two dose groups that received either 1×107 IU (low 683 dose) or 1×108 IU (high dose) on days 0 and 28 (11).
684 Bead-based serological multiplex assay.
685 Serum samples were obtained by venipuncture from vaccinated individuals. Bead-based 686 serological multiplex assay was performed using the MultiCoV-Ab assay validated previously 687 (16, 17). MagPlex Microspheres with immobilized different parts of the spike protein based on 688 SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain (GenBank accession no. MN908947.3) were used: 689 purified trimeric spike protein (S), S1-domain, RBD (all produced in-house) and S2-domain 690 (Sino Biological). Serum samples were incubated at a dilution of 1:400 for two hours at RT. 691 Subsequently, the beads were washed using 100 µl of washing buffer (PBS supplemented with 692 0.05% (v/v) Tween20) per well with aid of a LifeSep magnetic separator unit (Dexter magnetic 693 technologies). After three washing steps, bound antibodies were detected using PE-coupled 694 secondary anti-human IgG antibodies (Dianova, Cat-No. 109-116-098, Lot-No. 148837, 695 3µg/mL), incubated for 45 min at RT. Samples were measured using the Bio-Plex 200 System 696 (Bio-Rad Laboratories), controlled by BioPlex manager software, version 5.0.0.531. Cut-off 697 (CO) samples with a known MFI value were generated as previously established (44) and 698 included on each plate as quality control.

700 To quantify the cellular localization of S1 and S2, Huh-7 cells were infected with MVA-SARS701 S or -ST (MOI 0.5) or transfected with plasmids encoding unstabilized S. 18 h post 702 transfection/infection, S located at the cell surface was labeled at 4°C prior to fixation using an 703 anti-S1 monoclonal antibody derived from human (generated and kindly provided by F. Klein, 704 Institute of Virology, University Hospital of Cologne, Germany (18)). Subsequently, cells were 705 fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 and total S was labeled using anti706 S2 antibody from mouse (GeneTex, Cat-No. GTX632604, clone 1A9, 1:100). Polyclonal goat 707 anti-mouse AlexaFluor 594 (Cat-No. A-11005) and goat anti-human AlexaFluor 488 (Cat-No. 708 A-48276) secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:200) were used to visualize spike709 specific staining by fluorescence. Nuclei were stained with 1 µg/ml of DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, 710 Cat-No. D9542) and cells were analyzed using the Leica SP2 confocal microscope (Leica) with 711 ×63 objective. All quantification of IF-related data was performed with ImageJ/Fiji v.1.51 (45). 712 To quantify surface S, optical sections of Huh-7 cells (500 nm/slice) were acquired in order to 713 project the entire cell. Pixel intensities were measured in S1 (surface) and in S2 (total S) 714 channels. The ratio between S1 and S2 values was calculated giving the relative surface 715 expression. Prior to each analysis cell borders were determined using standard selection tools.
716 SARS-2 S1 surface staining for flow cytometry.
717 A549 cells were infected with 1 MOI MVA-S /-ST, and MVA and incubated for 16 h at 37°C, 718 cells were harvested and plated onto 96-well U-bottom plates at 2x105 cells/well. Cells were 719 incubated with purified anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Fc block; BioLegend, clone 93, 1:500) for 15 720 min on ice. Cells were incubated with anti-S1 human monoclonal antibody (see above,) for 30 721 min on ice and then with goat anti-human IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor® 488 (Thermo Fisher 722 Scientific, Cat-No. A-48276, 1:3000) for 30 min on ice. Cells were then stained with fixable 723 dead cell viability dye Zombie Aqua (Biolegend, Cat-No. 423101, 1:1000). After staining, cells 724 were fixed using Fixation Buffer (Biolegend) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Data

727 Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50).
728 Serum samples were used to analyze neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 (Isolate 729 Germany/BavPat1/2020; Isolate hCoV-19/USA/PHC658/2021, Lineage B.1.617.2 Delta 730 variant; Isolate hCoV-19/USA/MD-HP20874/2021, Lineage B.1.1.529, Omicron Variant) 731 received from BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH as previously described with some modifications 732 (46). Heat-inactivated serum samples were serially diluted 2-fold in duplicates in 50 µl DMEM. 733 Then 50 l of virus suspension (600 TCID50) was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 734 1 h before placing the mixtures on VeroE6 cells, seeded in 96-well pates. After incubation for 735 45 min, 100 µl of 1:1 mixture of pre-warmed DMEM and Avicel RC-591 (Dupont, Nutrition 736 & Biosciences) was added and plates were incubated for 24 h. After incubation, cells were fixed 737 with 4% formaldehyde/PBS and stained with a polyclonal rabbit antibody against SARS-CoV738 2 nucleoprotein (Sino Biological, Cat-No. 40588-T62, 1:2000) and a secondary peroxidase739 labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Agilent Dako, Cat-No. P044801-2, 1:1000). The signal was 740 developed using a precipitate forming TMB substrate (True Blue, KPL SeraCare, Cat-No. 741 5510-0030) and the number of infected cells per well was counted by using ImmunoSpot® 742 reader (CTL Europe GmbH). The reciprocal of the highest serum dilution allowing reduction 743 of >50% plaque formation was calculated as the serum neutralization titer (PRNT50) using 744 BioSpotTM Software Suite.
745 SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization test (VNT100).
746 The neutralizing activity of mouse serum antibodies was investigated based on a previously 747 published protocol (47). Briefly, samples were serially diluted in 96-well plates starting from a 748 1:16 serum dilution. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37°C together with 100 PFU of SARS-
31

749 CoV-2. Cytopathic effects on VeroE6 cells were analyzed 4 days (BavPat1, Alpha, Gamma) or 750 6 days (Zeta) after infection. Neutralization was defined as absence of the cytopathic effects 751 compared to virus controls. For each test, a positive control (human monoclonal antibody (18, 752 48)) was used in quadruplicate as an inter-assay neutralization standard.
753 Challenge-infection experiments in Syrian hamsters and K18-hACE2 mice.
754 For SARS-CoV-2 challenge-infection, animals were kept in individually ventilated cages 755 (IVCs, Tecniplast) in approved BSL-3 facilities. All animal and laboratory work with infectious 756 SARS-CoV-2 was performed in a biosafety level-3e laboratory and facilities at the Research 757 Center for Emerging Infections and Zoonoses (RIZ), University of Veterinary Medicine, 758 Hanover, Germany. 759 All animals were infected via intranasal route with 1x104 (hamsters) or 3.6x104 (mice) tissue 760 culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2 (Isolate Germany/BavPat1/2020, NR761 52370) received from BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH under anesthesia. After challenge infection 762 hamsters and mice were monitored at least twice daily for well-being, health constitution and 763 clinical signs using a clinical score sheet (Supplemental Table S2). Body weights were checked 764 daily.
765 Virus.
766 SARS-CoV-2 (Isolate Germany/BavPat1/2020, NR-52370; Isolate hCoV767 19/USA/PHC658/2021, Lineage B.1.617.2 Delta variant, NR-55611; Isolate hCoV768 19/USA/MD-HP20874/2021, Lineage B.1.1.529, Omicron variant, NR-56461) received from 769 BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH were propagated in VeroE6 cells (ATCC #CRL-1586) in DMEM 770 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 771 1% L-glutamine at 37°C. All infection experiments with SARS-CoV-2 were performed in
32

772 biosafety level 3 laboratories at the RIZ, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, 773 Germany or the Institute of Virology, Philipps University Marburg, Germany.
774 Measurement of viral burden.
775 Lung tissue samples of immunized and challenged hamsters or mice excised from the right lung 776 lobes, and brain tissue excised from the right brain of mice were homogenized in 1000 µl 777 DMEM containing antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin, Gibco). Tissue was homogenized 778 using the TissueLyser-II (Qiagen), and aliquots were stored at -80°C. Virus titers were 779 determined on Vero cells as median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50 units). Briefly, Vero 780 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and serial 10-fold dilutions of homogenized lung samples 781 in DMEM containing 5% FBS. After incubation for 96 hours at 37°C, cytopathic effects in 782 Vero cells were evaluated and calculated as TCID50 unit per gram or ml using the Reed-Muench 783 method. For samples without cytopathic effect, data points were set to half of detection limit 784 for statistical analysis purposes.
785 Statistical analysis.
786 Data were prepared using GraphPad Prism 9.0.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego CA, 787 USA) and R 4.2.1 and expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) or median ± 788 interquartile range. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test to 789 compare three or more groups. A P value < 0.05 was used as the threshold for statistical 790 significance.

Whereas acute-COVID-19 severity and outcome were previously correlated with Notch4 expression on regulatory T (Treg) cells, here we show that the Treg cells in MIS-C are destabilized through a Notch1-dependent mechanism. Genetic analysis revealed that MIS-C patients were enriched in rare deleterious variants impacting inflammation and autoimmunity pathways, including dominant-negative mutations in the Notch1 regulators NUMB and NUMBL leading to Notch1 upregulation. Notch1 signaling in Treg cells induced CD22, leading to their destabilization in a mTORC1-dependent manner and to the promotion of systemic inflammation. These results establish a Notch1-CD22 signaling axis that disrupts Treg cell function in MIS-C and point to distinct immune checkpoints controlled by individual Treg cell Notch receptors that shape the inflammatory outcome in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

61 Abstract 62 Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) evolves in some pediatric 63 patients following acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 by hitherto unknown mechanisms. 64 Whereas acute-COVID-19 severity and outcome were previously correlated with Notch4 65 expression on regulatory T (Treg) cells, here we show that the Treg cells in MIS-C are 66 destabilized through a Notch1-dependent mechanism. Genetic analysis revealed that 67 MIS-C patients were enriched in rare deleterious variants impacting inflammation and 68 autoimmunity pathways, including dominant-negative mutations in the Notch1 regulators 69 NUMB and NUMBL leading to Notch1 upregulation. Notch1 signaling in Treg cells 70 induced CD22, leading to their destabilization in a mTORC1-dependent manner and to 71 the promotion of systemic inflammation. These results establish a Notch1-CD22 signaling 72 axis that disrupts Treg cell function in MIS-C and point to distinct immune checkpoints 73 controlled by individual Treg cell Notch receptors that shape the inflammatory outcome in 74 SARS-CoV-2 infection.

76 Introduction 77 COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV78 2), has resulted in massive morbidity and mortality worldwide (1, 2). Acute infection is 79 associated in some subjects with pneumonia and marked hypoxia, leading to acute 80 respiratory distress syndrome as well as other life-threatening complications (3-5). This 81 inflammation critically involves a dysregulated immune response characterized by intense 82 activation of innate and adaptive immunity associated with features of a cytokine storm 83 (6, 7). While most patients recover from this acute infection, a subset develops persistent 84 symptoms related to different organ system dysfunction including the respiratory, 85 cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems (8). 86 A special case in point is the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. While most 87 children remain asymptomatic or develop mild infection, some develop a multi-system 88 inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) approximately one month after initial infection 89 (9-13). These patients exhibit severe immune dysregulation characterized by intense 90 cytokine production and lymphocyte activation associated with fever and end-organ 91 dysfunction including mucocutaneous, cardiovascular, hematologic, and especially 92 gastrointestinal systems (14-21). IFNg has been identified as a key cytokine in MIS-C with 93 increased levels associated with disease severity and organ system involvement (22-25). 94 The patients also exhibit robust T cells activation with T cell receptor repertoire skewing 95 (24-29). There are defining characteristics of MIS-C that remain perplexing, including the 96 substantial delay between the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C (9, 10, 12). Unlike 97 children with acute COVID-19 pneumonia, most patients with MIS-C are previously 98 healthy and are able to mount a robust immune response to SARS-CoV-2 with

99 neutralizing antibodies to the virus (11, 18, 30). This constellation of features in MIS-C 100 suggests that an evolving hyperinflammatory immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is part 101 of the pathophysiology of this syndrome. Indeed, studies based on relatively small 102 number of patients suggest that a genetic predisposition may contribute to the immune 103 dysregulation in MIS-C (31, 32). 104 Notch signaling pathways have emerged as important regulators of the immune system 105 by influencing both Treg and Tconv cells responses (33, 34). In mammals, the Notch 106 family is composed by 4 Notch receptors (Notch1-4) and 5 ligands (Delta-like1, 3, and 4 107 and Jagged1 and 2) (35). Recent studies have outlined a prominent role for NOTCH4 in 108 the immune dysregulation in acute COVID19 and related respiratory viral illnesses (36). 109 Notch4 is upregulated on lung tissue Treg cells in an IL-6-dependent manner to subvert 110 their tissue repair function in favor of an inflammatory response (36-39). The NOTCH4 111 locus is associated with critical illness in COVID-19 (40). However, the immune 112 dysregulatory mechanisms operative in post-acute COVID19 syndromes including MIS113 C remain unclear. 114 In this study, we show that MIS-C patients exhibit robust T cells activation in association 115 with increased Notch signaling in Treg cells. In particular, while NOTCH4 is also 116 upregulated on circulating Treg cells of children with acute COVID19 as a function of 117 disease severity, the Treg cells in MIS-C additionally upregulate NOTCH1 expression, a 118 pathway previously implicated in T helper cell type 1 (Th1)-skewed immune 119 dysregulation, autoimmunity, graft versus host disease and solid organ rejection (41, 42). 120 Gene enrichment using whole genome/exome sequence analysis employing Fisher 121 testing and Monte-Carlo simulation revealed the enrichment in MIS-C patients of rare

122 mutations impacting pathways of inflammation and autoimmunity, many of which 123 contained Notch-related genes. Consistent with these results, loss of function mutations 124 were identified in the negative NOTCH1 regulators NUMB and NUMBL (43). In vitro 125 experiment revealed that this loss of function mutations promotes Notch1 expression. 126 Moreover, in mice either expressing an active form of Notch1 in Treg cells 127 (Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+) or lacking NUMB expression in these cells (Foxp3EGFPCreNumb/), 128 treatment with Poly I:C to simulate viral infection induced systemic inflammation. Notch1 129 signaling in Treg cells induced the B cell inhibitory receptor CD22 (44, 45), which 130 promoted systemic inflammation in association with the expression of the a4b7 gut 131 homing receptor. CD22 destabilized Treg cells and impaired their suppressive function in 132 an mTORC1-dependent manner. Treatment of Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ or 133 Foxp3EGFPCreNumb/ mice with an anti-CD22 mAb suppressed the development of 134 systemic inflammation following Poly I:C treatment by restoring the Treg cells suppressive 135 function. These findings point to the mobilization of Treg cell-specific tissue inflammatory 136 licensing modules involving different Notch receptors that is operative in MIS-C and point 137 to interventions along the Notch1-CD22 axis as therapeutic strategy in MIS-C. 138

139 Results 140 Increased CD4+ T cell activation and Treg cell destabilization in MIS-C. To elucidate 141 the immune dysregulatory mechanisms operative in MIS-C, we studied an international 142 cohort of 45 children with MIS-C and 50 children with COVID-19 from centers in the United 143 States, Italy and Turkey (Table S1 and Patient Cohorts section in Methods). For 144 comparison, 5 children with Kawasaki disease (KD), 12 adults with COVID-19, and 18 145 pediatric healthy controls were also evaluated. All MIS-C patients met the Centers for 146 Disease Control (CDC) Case Definition for MIS-C (46), while 93% fulfilled the WHO case 147 definition (47-49). Fever was universal in MIS-C patients and rash (49%), conjunctivitis 148 (58%), and GI symptoms (96%) were also common. Children with MIS-C were highly 149 inflamed (median CRP 16.0 mg/dL, IQR 7.8-24.0), lymphopenic (median absolute 150 lymphocyte count 0.91 x103/mL, IQR 0.53-1.35) and coagulopathic (median D-dimer 3.1 151 mcg/mL, IQR 1.5-6.2). Over 90% of MIS-C patients demonstrated positive SARS-CoV-2 152 serologies. 18/45 (40%) were considered to have severe MIS-C defined by admission to 153 the intensive care unit (ICU), need for vasopressor support, and/or development of 154 coronary artery aneurysms. The demographics and key clinical findings in the respective 155 patient groups are delineated in Table S1. 156 To further delineate the CD4+ T cell dynamics in MIS-C, we carried out single-cell RNA 157 sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on CD4+ T cells from the peripheral blood of four 158 healthy controls, three MIS-C patients sampled prior to treatment and another five MIS-C 159 patients sampled post-treatment. We first mapped our transcriptomic data to a reference 160 human PBMC dataset using Azimuth (50), thereby delineating 6 subsets of CD4+ T cells 161 (Fig. 1 A and B). We further performed a graph-based clustering analysis using Seurat,

162 which uncovered 16 clusters. Eight of these clusters (Clusters 1 to 8) were enriched in 163 cells annotated as CD4 naïve by Azimuth and expressing genes associated with a naïve 164 CD4+ T cell profile (e.g., CCR7 and SELL), 5 (Clusters 10 to 14) were enriched in 165 activated CD4+ T cells (CD69), including one with high NF-kB signaling (Cluster 10; 166 NFKB1). The final 3 clusters encompassed a mix of naïve and activated cells, including 167 one cluster delineated by viral sensing gene transcripts (Cluster 9; IFIT2, IFIT3), one 168 cluster enriched in Treg cell transcripts (Cluster 15; FOXP3) and another with mitotic cells 169 (Cluster 16; TRBC1) (Fig. S1A-F). Prior to treatment, MIS-C patients exhibited prominent 170 expansion of cluster 10, enclosing both cells annotated as Tconv and Treg cells by 171 Azimuth. Cluster 10 was characterized by increased NFKB1 expression, and NF-kB 172 signaling and contracted following immunomodulatory therapy (Fig. S1A-F). 173 To further decipher differences in CD4+ T cell transcriptomic programs between patient 174 groups, we also performed pseudobulk differential analysis (DEA) with a focus on both 175 Treg (cells found in Cluster 15 or delineated as Treg cells by Azimuth) and Tconv cells 176 (cells found in clusters 9 to 14 and delineated as activated Tconv by Azimuth). We 177 aggregated gene expression data at the patient level for Treg cells and activated Tconv, 178 and performed pairwise comparisons of MIS-C pre-treatment, post-treatment and control 179 groups using DESeq2. The DEA were followed by gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) 180 against the MSigDB Hallmark collection and using the ranked log2 fold changes as input, 181 which reinforced our prior observations of NF-kB pathway activation in pre-treatment MIS182 C samples, not only in Tconv but also in Treg cells (Fig. 1 C-H and Fig S1G-H ). Pathways 183 that were up regulated in the MIS-C pre-treatment group included mTORC1, whose 184 hyperactivity has been previously noted to mediate Treg cell destabilization (Fig. 1 C-H

185 and Fig S1G-H) (51, 52). These results indicated that MIS-C is associated with enhanced 186 Tconv activation and Treg dysregulation. 187 Increased NOTCH1 expression on CD4+ Treg and Tconv cells in MIS-C. Previous 188 studies have demonstrated a key role for Notch signaling-mediated Treg cell 189 dysregulation in licensing tissue inflammation (36, 38, 41, 42). For example, NOTCH4 is 190 upregulated in lung tissue Treg cells during SARS-CoV2 and influenza infections, leading 191 to enhanced tissue inflammation and disease severity (36). We analyzed the expression 192 of different Notch receptors on CD4+ Treg and Tconv cells in pediatric subjects with mild 193 and severe COVID19 and those with MIS-C. As comparison groups we included healthy 194 children, adults with severe COVID19 and children with KD, some of whose clinical 195 features overlap with those of MIS-C (16, 31, 48, 49). There was marked increase in 196 NOTCH1 expression on both Treg and Tconv cells of patients with MIS-C but not on those 197 of other subject groups (Fig. 2A-C, Fig S2A). NOTCH4 expression was also selectively 198 increased on the circulating Treg cells of adult and pediatric subjects with severe COVID199 19 and with MIS-C but not on their Tconv cells. NOTCH4 was also not upregulated on 200 Treg cells of patients with mild COVID19 or with KD (Fig. 2D-F, Fig S2B). NOTCH1 201 expression in MISC was associated with increased intracellular expression of NOTCH1 202 cytoplasmic domain (N1c) in Treg cell (Fig. 2G). In contrast, NOTCH2 expression was 203 increased on NOTCH1+ Treg and Tconv cells of MIS-C subjects albeit at a lower 204 magnitude than that of NOTCH1, while there was no difference in the NOTCH2 single 205 positive Treg and Tconv cell populations between MIS-C and healthy controls (Fig. S2C, 206 Fig. S3 A and B, E-F). Expression of NOTCH1 and NOTCH4 on Treg cells of MIS-C 207 patients was non-overlapping, suggesting that they may represent distinct Treg cell

208 populations possibly arising in different tissues (Fig. S3E-F). Also, there was no 209 difference in NOTCH3 expression between the circulating Treg and Tconv cells of 210 different patient populations and control subjects (Fig. S2D and Fig. S3C and D). Overall, 211 these results identified increased NOTCH1 expression on Treg and Tconv cells as a 212 distinguishing feature of pediatric patients with MIS-C. 213 Further analysis revealed that MIS-C patients present a decrease of naive Tconv and 214 Treg cells associated with an increase of activated T cells (Fig. S4 A to B). As in previous 215 studies (7), we found increased serum levels of IP-10, IL-1b, IL-6 and IFNl2/3 in MIS-C 216 and in severe COVID-19 compared to controls (Fig. 2H). Also, Treg and Tconv cells of 217 patients with MIS-C versus severe COVID-19, KD and control subjects had increased 218 IFN-g production (Fig. S4, C and D). Notably, IFN-g expression was selectively increased 219 in Treg cells of MIS-C subjects, while IFN-g expression in Tconv cells was common to 220 both severe COVID-19 and MIS-C (Fig. S4, C and D). We analyzed the capacity of 221 different cytokines found increased in the sera of MIS-C subjects to induce NOTCH1 222 expression on cell-sorted CD4+CD25+CD127- human Treg cells from control subjects. IL223 1b and IL-6, and to a lesser extent IFN-g and IP-10 all induced increased NOTCH1 224 expression on human Treg cells (Fig. 2I). MISC patients from North America and Europe 225 were overall closely matched in their immunological analyses, with only differences found 226 in NOTCH4, IP-10 and IFNL1 between these two cohorts (Fig.S5 A-F). Together, these 227 results linked the upregulation of NOTCH1 expression on CD4+ Treg and Tconv cells with 228 the development of MIS-C. 229 Identification of Notch pathway genetic variants in MIS-C. To investigate underlying 230 genetic factors that may predispose to MIS-C versus acute pediatric COVID-19, we

231 performed gene-enrichment tests for rare variants (stop-gain/start-loss, frameshift 232 deletions/insertions and canonical splicing mutations) using 8626 pathways from Gene233 Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases 234 (8,299 and 327 respectively). We collected genome and exome sequences on 39 MIS-C 235 and 24 acute pediatric COVID-19 subjects, which we compared with 8 different datasets 236 comprising 4,682 exomes collected at the Boston Children's Hospital, including 4 rare 237 disease categories, obesity, myopathy, autism-ADHD and Immune 238 deficiency/dysregulation (53) (see Methods section). All samples were processed using 239 the Variant Explorer (VExP) Pipeline with the same set parameters to avoid bias in the 240 selection of the rare variants (54). We performed a Fisher test for each group to test for 241 enrichment in the respective GO and KEGG pathways. Furthermore, we validated these 242 results by Monte-Carlo simulation testing as an unbiased stochastic approach to test for 243 enrichment in genetic variants along individual pathways in the MIS-C group versus the 244 sum total of the clinical comparison groups used for the Fisher tests, as described in the 245 Methods section. Several inflammation and autoimmunity pathways were significantly 246 enriched in rare mutations (10 in 280,000 chromosomes) in MIS-C versus acute 247 pediatric COVID-19 and the other comparison groups (Fig. 3A and B, Dataset 1). A 248 number of those pathways contained NOTCH related genes. Specific NOTCH pathway 249 mutations predicted to be damaging and linked to those pathways were identified included 250 NOTCH2, NOTCH4 and RBPJL (Dataset 2). Additionally, and in agreement with a 251 previous report (55), we also detected rare heterozygous mutations in some genes 252 associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, including AP3B1, PRF1,

253 LYST and DOCK8, in patients with MIS-C (Dataset 2). Overall, these results supported 254 the presence of an underlying genetic predisposition for MIS-C.

255 To validate the above findings from our initial cohort, we screened 88 additional patients

256 with MIS-C from the U.S. multicenter Overcoming COVID-19 Network for mutations in

257 Notch-related genes (see methods in Supplement) (9, 56). Rare damaging mutations

258 were identified in NUMB and NUMBL, encoding closely conserved eponymous proteins

259 that negatively regulate Notch receptor signaling and trafficking and which are expressed

260 by human Treg and Tconv cells (Fig S1D and E) (43, 57-59). We further analyzed three

261 mutations found in different patients that localized to the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB)

262 domain of NUMB (NM_001005745.1:c.280C>T; p.Leu94Phe), NUMBL

263 (NM_004756.5:c.236G>T,NP_004747.1:p.Ser79Ile)

and

NUMBL

264 (NM_004756.5:c.262G>A,NP_004747.1:p.Val88Met) (Fig. 4A and Dataset 3). These

265 mutations, which were either not found in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)

266 (NUMBLeu94Phe and NUMBLSer79IIe; gnomAD=0) or very rarely so (NUMBLVal88Met;

267 gnomAD=4), were predicted to impair NUMB and NUMBL regulatory functions (43, 58,

268 59). This prediction was tested by analyzing the impact of the respective NUMB/NUMBL

269 mutations on NOTCH1 expression and function. Transgenic expression of the respective

270 mutant protein in CRISPR-Cas9-generated NUMB/NUMBL-deficient human embryonic

271 kidney 293 (HEK293) cells revealed that their expression was similar to wild-type NUMB

272 (NUMBWT) and NUMBL (NUMBLWT) proteins (Fig. 4B and C). However, whereas

273 transgenic NUMBWT and NUMBLWT decreased NOTCH1 expression in HEK293 cells, the

274 NUMBLeu94Phe, NUMBLSer79IIe and NUMBLVal88Met mutants failed to do so. Similarly,

275 transgenic NUMBWT and to a lesser extent NUMBLWT decreased nuclear NOTCH1

276 cytoplasmic domain (N1c) expression whereas the mutant proteins failed to do so (Fig. 277 4D and E). Co-transfection studies revealed that the NUMBLeu94Phe behaved as a 278 dominant negative mutation that suppressed the capacity of NUMBWT to decrease 279 NOTCH1 and NOTCH1c expression (Fig. 4D). The NUMBLSer79IIe and NUMBLVal88Met also 280 behaved as dominant negative mutants in antagonizing the decrease in NOTCH1c (N1c) 281 expression induced by NUMBLWT (Fig. 4 E). Studies on the PBMCs of patients with the 282 NUMB and NUMBL mutations showed upregulation of NOTCH1 expression on the Treg 283 cells of all three patients (Fig. S6 A-C). Expression of N1c reflected the functional impact 284 of these mutations as revealed in the vitro testing (Fig. 4D and E), with the different 285 mutations falling along a spectrum of NUMBLeu94Phe > NUMBLSer79IIe > NUMBLVal88Met (Fig. 286 S6 A-F). These results established that the identified NUMB/NUMBL mutations were 287 functionally deleterious and that MIS-C subjects may harbor mutations in the Notch 288 pathway that contribute to disease pathogenesis. 289 Poly I:C-induced multiorgan inflammatory disease in Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice. To 290 further delineate the mechanisms by which increased NOTCH1 signaling in CD4+ T cells 291 promotes MIS-C, and in view of the critical role played by Treg cells in licensing Notch1292 dependent immune dysregulation (41, 42), we employed a mouse model in which the 293 intracellular domain of Notch1 (N1c) is conditionally expressed from the Rosa26 locus 294 (R26N1c/+) in Treg cells using a Foxp3 promoter-regulated Cre recombinase fused with 295 EGFP (Foxp3EGFPCre) (Fig. 5A) (41). Treatment of Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice with 296 polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), a proxy model of infection with RNA viruses (36, 297 60-62), resulted in progressive weight loss and multi-organ inflammation. In contrast, Poly 298 I:C-treated control Foxp3EGFPCre were minimally affected (Fig. 5B-D). Analysis of CD4+ T

299 cells of Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice revealed that their activation phenotype recapitulated 300 that of CD4+ T cells of MIS-C patients, including increased memory markers 301 (CD44+CD62L-) and heightened IFNg production by both Treg and Tconv cells (Fig. 5E302 G). 303 Most MIS-C patients present gastrointestinal symptoms (Table S1) (14) (13). Notably, the 304 Treg and to a lesser extent the Tconv cells of the Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice had 305 increased expression of the gut-homing integrin a4b7 (Fig. 5H). Increased expression of 306 integrin a4b7 (ITGB7) was also observed on the circulating Treg cells of MIS-C but not 307 acute pediatric COVID-19 subjects, in agreement with a critical role of Notch1 in driving 308 the expression of this marker (Fig. 5I). Consistent with this finding, MIS-C patients 309 exhibited an increase in CD62L-CD38+ mucosally imprinted Treg cells (Fig. S7A) (63, 310 64). sc-RNA seq analysis demonstrated increased ITGB7 transcripts (Fig. 5J and Fig. 311 S7B). Expression of integrin a4b7 on Treg cells of MIS-C subjects declined post312 treatment, in synchrony with decreased Notch1 and CD22 expression (Fig. 5K-M). These 313 results indicated that increased Notch1 activity in Treg cells predisposes to multi-organ 314 inflammation in the context of a viral trigger and promotes Treg cell gut homing. 315 Notch1-mediated CD22 upregulation on Treg cells promotes multi-organ 316 inflammation. To delineate the mechanisms by which Notch1 signaling in Treg cells 317 promotes multi organ inflammation in the context of a viral trigger, we analyzed the 318 transcriptome of Notch1c-expressing Treg cells for pathways involved in the immune 319 dysregulation (41). We found upregulation of CD22, a member of the Siglec family of 320 lectins normally found in B cells, where it acts to regulate B cell receptor signaling (45). 321 In particular, CD22 directs B cells to the intestinal lymphoid and mucosal tissues by

322 upregulating the expression of the gut homing receptor a4b7 (44). Flow cytometric 323 analysis of Treg cells of Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice revealed increased CD22 expression 324 upon treatment of the mice with Poly I:C (Fig. 6A). Expression of CD22 in Treg cells was 325 abrogated upon Treg cell-specific deletion of Rbpj, the gene encoding the Notch 326 canonical pathway transcriptional co-factor RBPJ (Fig. S8A). Analysis of peripheral blood 327 Treg cells of MIS-C subjects revealed increased expression of CD22 that strongly 328 correlated with NOTCH1 expression on these cells (Fig. 6B). CD22 expression was also 329 increased in patients with NUMB/NUMBL mutations in accord with the impact of the 330 mutation (Fig. S6 G-I). In contrast, CD22 was minimally expressed on CD4+ Tconv cells 331 of control, acute COVID-19 and MIS-C subjects, and it did not correlate with Notch1 332 expression on these cells signaling (Fig. 6B and C). These results indicated that CD22 333 was upregulated on Treg cells with active NOTCH1 signaling. 334 The functional relevance of CD22 expression on Treg cells was analyzed by performing 335 in vitro Treg cell suppression assays on Treg cells pooled from different mice, which 336 revealed profoundly defective suppressive function of CD22+ Treg cells of 337 Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice compared to Treg cells of Foxp3EGFPCre control mice. This 338 defect was corrected upon treatment of Treg cells with the anti-CD22 mAb (Fig. 6D). 339 Similarly, the suppressive function of MIS-C Treg cells was profoundly deficient compared 340 to that of Treg cells of healthy controls, which was corrected upon treatment of the cells 341 with the anti-CD22 mAb (Fig. 6E). 342 To determine the role of CD22 expression on Treg cells in the multi organ inflammatory 343 disease triggered by Poly I:C treatment of Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice, we examined the 344 impact of therapy with a neutralizing anti-CD22 mAb on disease outcome in these mice.

345 Anti-CD22 mAb treatment prevented the weight loss and the multi-organ inflammation 346 induced by Poly I:C treatment (Fig. 7A-C). It downregulated the activation of splenic 347 CD44+CD62L- Tconv cells and the expression by Treg and Tconv cells of IFNg (Fig. 7C348 F). Anti-CD22 mAb treatment also downregulated the expression by splenic Treg cells of 349 a4b7 (Fig. 7F). Anti-CD22 mAb treatment did not deplete Treg cells (Fig. 7G). In contrast, 350 B cell depletion with an anti-B cell specific anti-CD20 mAb failed on its own to protect 351 against disease or to abrogate protection by anti-CD22 mAb treatment (Fig. S8B and C). 352 Analysis of gut lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) revealed increased infiltration with 353 activated (CD44+CD62L-) Tconv and Treg cells with increased expression of IFNg that 354 was similarly downregulated upon treatment with the anti-CD22 mAb (Fig. S8D and E). 355 Overall, these results indicated that anti-CD22 mAb treatment suppressed both the gut 356 and systemic inflammation induced by Poly I:C treatment of Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice. 357 To further link the above results with our human studies, we employed another mouse 358 model in which a floxed Numb allele was conditionally deleted in Treg cells 359 (Foxp3YFPCreNUMBD/D) (Fig. S9A and B). Treatment of Foxp3YFPCreNUMBD/D mice with 360 Poly I:C intraperitoneally resulted in progressive weight loss similar to what was observed 361 in Poly I:C-treated Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice. In contrast, Poly I: C-treatment of control 362 Foxp3YFPCre had no effect (Fig. S9C and D). Analysis of CD4+ T cells of 363 Foxp3YFPCreNUMBD/D mice revealed that their activation phenotype recapitulated that of 364 CD4+ T cells of MIS-C patients, including increased memory markers (CD44+CD62L-) 365 and heightened IFNg production by Tconv cells (Fig. S9E and F). Moreover, Treg cells of 366 Poly I:C-treated Foxp3YFPCreNUMBD/D mice also showed upregulation of Notch1, N1c, 367 CD22 and a4b7 that recapitulated the Treg cell phenotype of MIS-C patients and Poly

368 I:C-treated Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice (Fig. S9G-J). Finally, treatment of 369 Foxp3YFPCreNUMBD/D mice with an anti-CD22 mAb prevented disease development 370 following Poly I:C treatment, downregulated Notch pathway and gut homing markers and 371 suppressed CD4+ T cell expansion and activation and IFNg expression in both the spleen 372 and the gut (Fig. S9A-M). Overall, these results indicated that Notch1-dependent 373 induction of CD22 expression on Treg cells plays a crucial pro-inflammatory role in Poly 374 I:C-treated Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice. 375 To determine the mechanisms by which CD22 subverted Treg cell function, we analyzed 376 the steady state transcriptome of a pool of CD22+ Treg cells of Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice 377 compared to control Foxp3EGFPCre Treg cells or CD22- Treg cells of Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+. 378 KEGG/GO pathway analysis showed increased expression of genes involved in the 379 regulation of the immune response, T cell migration and Notch signaling (Fig. S10A-F). 380 Furthermore, we analyzed by flow cytometry the phenotypes of CD22+ colonic and splenic 381 of Treg cells Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/+ mice isolated at steady state and following Poly I:C382 treatment in comparison with those of Treg cells of similarly treated Foxp3EGFPCre mice. 383 The CD22+ Treg cells exhibited decreased expression of Helios and NRP-1 both at steady 384 state and after Poly I:C treatment in the face of similar expression of markers of T cell 385 activation including CD44, suggesting their decreased stability (Fig. S10G and H). In 386 agreement with this conclusion, Foxp3 expression also decreased in CD22+ Treg cells 387 following Poly I:C treatment. Treatment with anti-CD22 mAb reversed those defects in 388 both colonic and splenic Treg cells (Fig. 8A and Fig. S10H and I). 389 CD22 regulates B cell receptor signaling by forming a molecular scaffold that enables 390 coordinated docking of different downstream signaling pathways (65). Analysis of CD22+

391 Treg cells revealed enhanced activation of T cell receptor-coupled pathways compared 392 to control Treg cells, with increased phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated 393 kinases (ERK) and the phospholipase C gamma 1 (pPLCg1) (Fig. 8B). Downstream of 394 the PI3-kinase pathway, phosphorylation of the kinase AKT at residue T308, a target of 395 upstream phosphoinositide-dependent kinases, and the mammalian target of rapamycin 396 complex 1 (mTORC1) substrate S6 kinase were also increased (Fig. 8C) (66, 67). 397 Treatment with an anti-CD22 mAb downregulated S6 phosphorylation, thus indicating 398 active intracellular signaling by CD22 in Treg cells (Fig. 9A and B). Anti-CD22 mAb 399 treatment corrected the decreased MFI of Foxp3 found at the end of the In-vitro Treg 400 suppressive assay, indicative of reversal of CD22+ Treg cell instability (Fig. 9C and D). 401 Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin reversed the regulatory defect in CD22+ 402 Treg cells and the associated loss of Foxp3 expression (Fig. 9E to G). These results 403 indicated that CD22 positively enhanced T cell receptor signaling in Treg cells leading to 404 their destabilization and loss of regulatory function by an mTORC1-dependent 405 mechanism. 406

407 Discussion 408 In this study, we demonstrate that MIS-C entails the mobilization of a Treg cell-specific 409 pathway involving Notch1-CD22 signaling that promotes immune dysregulation and 410 which can be demonstrated both in human subjects and in proxy mouse models. Patients 411 with MIS-C but not children or adults with acute COVID-19 demonstrated increased 412 NOTCH1 expression on circulating CD4+ Treg and Tconv cells, all of which declined 413 precipitously following anti-inflammatory therapy. The pathogenic function of this pathway 414 was confirmed by the identification of dominant negative mutations in PTB domains of 415 NUMB and NUMBL in MIS-C subjects that resulted in increased NOTCH1 expression. It 416 was also supported by the demonstration of a role for Notch pathway-related mutations 417 in MIS-C using Monte Carlo simulation and Fisher Test. Uniquely, MIS-C subjects 418 exhibited increased CD22 expression on Treg but not Tconv cells which could be 419 demonstrated in mice to involve Notch1 signaling via the RBPJ-k canonical pathway. 420 CD22 blockade was sufficient to inhibit the immune dysregulation triggered by Notch1 421 signaling in Treg cell in the Poly I:C proxy viral infection model, highlighting the critical 422 role of this molecule in MIS-C disease pathogenesis. 423 Our previous studies have identified NOTCH4 to be specifically upregulated on circulating 424 Treg cells in adult subjects with COVID-19; their origin could be traced in mouse models 425 of viral infection to the lung (36). NOTCH4 was similarly upregulated on circulating Treg 426 cells of pediatric subjects with acute COVID-19, while both NOTCH4 and NOTCH1 were 427 upregulated on those of MIS-C subjects. However, expression of NOTCH1 and NOTCH4 428 on MIS-C Treg cells was mutually exclusive, suggesting that the respective Treg cell 429 populations were ontogenically distinct. These findings suggest that NOTCH4 and

430 NOTCH1 regulate distinct checkpoints in the evolution of immune dysregulation following 431 SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections. Thus, NOTCH4 appears critical for licensing lung 432 inflammation following SARS-CoV2, influenza and related viral infections (36). In contrast, 433 increased NOTCH1 expression on Treg and Tconv cells, with at least some of the latter 434 being derived from destabilized NOTCH1+ Treg cells, may favor the evolution of Th1435 skewed systemic inflammation (41, 42). Overall, our studies provide a mechanistic 436 framework for the evolution of autoimmunity in MIS-C by establishing Notch pathway437 dependent Treg cell dysfunction as a critical step in this process (16, 17, 25) 438 Mouse studies revealed that a critical step by which Notch1 signaling in Treg cells 439 promotes systemic inflammation involves its induction of CD22, an inhibitory receptor 440 previously associated with B cells, where it functions as a regulator of B cell receptor 441 signaling. More recently, CD22 has been described to direct the homing of B cells to the 442 gut lymphoid and mucosal tissues by virtue of its upregulation of the gut homing integrin 443 a4b7 (44). Consistent with these findings, treatment of mice whose Treg cells express a 444 gain of function Notch1 mutant with an anti-CD22 blocking antibody rescued their gut and 445 systemic inflammation following treatment with Poly I: C. CD22 impaired the in vitro Treg 446 cell suppressive function, an effect that was reversed by treatment with the anti-CD22 447 blocking antibody. Notwithstanding its function as an inhibitory receptor, Treg cells 448 expressing CD22 demonstrated increased T cell receptor signaling with increased 449 mTORC1 activity, leading to defective Treg cell suppressive function that was reversed 450 by treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. 451 MIS-C is a rare complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection (68), suggesting a genetic 452 predisposition to this disorder. In that regard, mutations in a number of immune regulatory

453 genes have been described in MIS-C, including SOCS1, XIAP and CYBB as well as HLA454 class I alleles and rare heterozygous mutations in genes associated with hemophagocytic 455 lymphohistiocytosis (25, 27, 32, 55). We found variants in a number of Notch pathway 456 genes in patients with MIS-C. Importantly, dominant negative loss of function mutations 457 in NUMB and NUMBL found in MISC subjects resulted in increased NOTCH1 expression 458 and NOTCH1 signaling, consistent with the pathogenic function of these mutations in this 459 pathway in promoting MIS-C in the context of a systemic viral infection such as with 460 SARS-CoV2. 461 Collectively, these results allow for the construction of a model that traces the evolution 462 of MIS-C. An initial infection with the SARS-CoV2 virus results in the expansion of 463 NOTCH4 and NOTCH1 Treg cells, the latter favored by rare genetic variants found in the 464 susceptible host. A subset of NOTCH1+ Treg cells upregulates CD22, which severely 465 impairs their regulatory function and drives their homing to the gut where they promote 466 inflammation, possibly instigated by persistence of SARS-CoV2 in the gastrointestinal 467 tract and/or in reaction to the gut microbiota (14). This cascading immune dysregulatory 468 process may be amplified by heightened responses among some children to pathogen469 and damage-associated signals (21), which aggravates the systemic spread of 470 inflammation and the broad disruption of tissue Treg cell function. Importantly, Notch471 related immune dysregulation may extend to involve other disease states associated with 472 inflammation including other viral infections, inflammatory bowel disease and graft versus 473 host disease (41, 42, 44, 69). This dysregulation is reversible by anti-inflammatory 474 therapy that targets cytokines involved in Notch1 induction. Our results also suggest that 475 blockade of CD22 or treatment with the mTORC1/2 inhibitor rapamycin may provide an

476 alternative therapy in those patients who prove resistant to standard of care anti477 inflammatory therapy. 478 Acknowledgment 479 We would like to acknowledge David A.

518 Experimental Procedures 519 Patient Cohorts Contributing to the Flow Cytometry, Transcriptomic, and 520 Functional Studies: 521 MIS-C and Pediatric COVID-19: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from children 522 with COVID-19 (n=9) and MIS-C (n=23) who were prospectively recruited from Boston 523 Children's Hospital (BCH) as part of the Taking on COVID-19 Together Study and the 524 Kawasaki Disease (KD) Biorepository between 5/2020 and 4/2021. In addition, blood 525 samples were also collected from children cared for at the Marmara University Hospital 526 in Istanbul, Turkey (8 COVID-19, 8 MIS-C from 12/2020 to 1/2021), Istanbul University527 Cerrahpaa, Istanbul, Turkey (20 COVID-19, 2 MIS-C from 7/2020 to 1/2021), Gaslini 528 Institute in Genoa, Italy (4 MIS-C from 12/2020 to 3/2021), and the Bambino Gesù 529 Children's Hospital in Rome, Italy (13 COVID-19, 12 MIS-C from 3/2020 to 4/2021). The 530 clinical characteristics of children with MIS-C and pediatric COVID-19 are reported in 531 Table S1. All Patients with MIS-C met the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Case 532 Definition for MIS-C (46). Patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or 533 vasopressor support or those who developed coronary artery aneurysms (z-score  2.5) 534 were classified as having severe MIS-C. 535 Children with COVID-19 presented with either a fever, respiratory illness, and/or known 536 COVID-19 exposure and were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive by polymerase chain 537 reaction (PCR). Moderate pediatric COVID-19 was defined by a supplemental oxygen 538 requirement and care on the pediatric ward while severe disease required ICU admission 539 and/or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) or mechanical ventilation. All other 540 children with COVID-19 were defined as having mild cases.

541 Adult COVID-19: Twelve patients previously described (Harb et al, 2021) were used in 542 this study. 543 Kawasaki Disease: Five children with KD provided peripheral blood samples through the 544 KD Biorepository at BCH from 10/2020 to 1/2021 (Table 1). These patients fulfilled the 545 clinical criteria for either complete or incomplete KD as outlined by the American Heart 546 Association (AHA)(70). Further, all of these patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by 547 both PCR and serology and had no known close contacts with COVID-19. 548 Controls: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from pediatric control subjects 549 recruited from Boston Children's Hospital (n=6), Istanbul University-Cerrahpaa (n=7), 550 and Gaslini Institute (n=5). Clinical characteristics of the control study subjects can be 551 found in Table S1. 552 Sample Processing: Peripheral blood samples were obtained at study enrollment in either 553 sodium heparin or EDTA tubes. At each site, PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll density 554 gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. 555 Gene Pathway Analyses using the Fischer and Monte-Carlo tests. Whole genome or 556 whole exome sequences were obtained from patients with MIS-C and children with 557 COVID-19. These patients were recruited from the Taking on COVID-19 Together Study 558 at Boston Children's Hospital (30 with MIS-C and 21 with COVID-19) as well as the 559 Marmara University Hospital (9 with MIS-C and 3 with COVID-19). 560 In addition, whole exome and genome sequencing data obtained from 1,885 families 561 (4682 samples) at the Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research were used for gene562 enrichment test [Manton Center for Orphan Disease Research: 563 https://www.mantonfoundation.org/]. Data were divided in 4 groups depending in their

564 phenotypes: obesity (86 samples), myopathy (310 samples), autism-ADHD (1296 565 samples) or rare diseases (2990 samples). Rare diseases were subdivided depending on 566 the sequencing provider, Broad Institute (1006 samples), GeneDx (715 samples), Boston 567 Children's Hospital (545 samples) and others (724 samples). 162 families (385 samples) 568 with immunodeficiency, allergic dysregulation, autoimmunity, and recurrent infections 569 obtained from Boston Children's Hospital repositories were also included in our analysis. 570 Patient Screening for NOTCH-related Genes: Blood samples from patients with MIS-C 571 enrolled in the Overcoming COVID-19 Immunobiology Study we obtained from 20 large 572 pediatric sites in the U.S.A and were sent for whole exome sequencing (88 MIS-C from 573 6/2020 to 5/2021). DNA was isolated from whole blood using the Gentra Puregene Blood 574 Kit (Qiagen) or by GeneDx using IDT xGen probes. Libraries for whole exome sequencing 575 were prepared using Agilent Technologies SureSelectXT2 Homo Sapiens All Exon V6 576 Kit. Paired end sequencing was performed with an Illumina HiSeq-2000, generating 150 577 base reads. Sequencing alignment to the hg19/GRCh37 reference build was performed 578 using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (71). Variant calling and candidate variant analysis 579 were completed by utilizing the Boston Children's Hospital Genomic Learning System, as 580 previously described (53). Minor allelic frequencies for the specified variants were 581 identified by using the Genome Aggregation Database (72). 582 Mice. The following mouse strains were obtained from the JAX Laboratories: 583 Foxp3EGFPCre (B6129S-Tg (Foxp3-EGFP/icre)1aJbs/J), Rosa26N1c/+. Rbpj1fl/fl (B6.129P2584 Rbpjtm1Hon/HonRbrc) mice were a kind gift of Tasuku Honjo.
585 Single-cell RNA sequencing. Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed in plain RPMI 586 (HyClone) pre-warmed to 37°C, washed in PBS (HyClone) and resuspended in FACS

587 buffer (PBS with 1.5% FBS (Genesee Scientific) and 2.5 mM EDTA (Invitrogen)) for CD4 588 T cell enrichment through negative selection (Miltenyi Biotec). Samples were studied in 2 589 independent experiments: experiment 1 included 3 pediatric controls, 1 pre-treatment 590 MIS-C patient, and 4 post-treatment MIS-C patients; experiment 2 included 1 pediatric 591 control, 2 pre-treatment MIS-C patients, and 1 post-treatment MIS-C patient. Detailed 592 procedures are described in Supplemental Materials section. 593 Single-cell RNA sequencing clustering analyses. Sequencing data from each 10x run 594 were processed with the CellRanger pipeline (10x Genomics) for demultiplexing and gene 595 alignment (73). The resulting raw count matrices were imported in R (v4.0.2 and above) 596 using Seurat (v4.0.3) (50). Data from all 3 runs were merged into one Seurat object. 597 Genes detected in <1 per 10,000 cells were filtered out, leaving a transcriptomic coverage 598 of 21,675 genes. High quality cells with >1400 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), >700 599 genes, a log10(gene) to log10(UMI) ratio >0.84 and mitochondrial to nuclear gene ratio 600 <0.08 were retained for downstream analyses. Quality control revealed no significant 601 batch effect: similar distributions were observed for the metrics mentioned above across 602 different runs and experiments. Detailed procedures are described in Supplemental 603 Materials section. 604 Pseudobulk differential expression analyses (DEA). For pseudobulk differential 605 expression analyses (DEA), gene expression level data was aggregated at the patient 606 level for each subset of interest, namely Tregs and activated Tconv. For this analysis, we 607 considered as Treg any cell assigned to Seurat Cluster 15 (FOXP3-expressing cells) or 608 annotated as Treg by Azimuth, which added up to 1,925 Treg cells across all 12 patients. 609 Similarly, we considered as activated Tconv any cell assigned to Seurat Clusters 9 to 14

610 and annotated as CD4 TCM, CD4 TEM, CD4 CTL or CD4 Proliferating by Azimuth (6,674 611 cells). Detailed procedures are described in Supplemental Materials section.
612 Gene pathway analysis using the Fischer and Monte-Carlo tests. To identify if a 613 pathway is relevant to MIS-C or acute-COVID-19 (mild and severe pediatrics patients), 614 a comparison between MIS-C or acute-COV19 and the eight databanks described 615 above was performed as detailed in the Supplemental Materials section. 616 CRISPR/Cas9 Knock-out generation. HEK293 cells were transfected with 617 CRISPR/Cas9 knockout plasmids NUMB/NUMBL (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) using a 618 CalPhos Mammalian Transfection kit (Takara), following the manufacturer protocol. 619 CRISPR positive cells were isolated by FACS and plated at very low density to induce 620 the formation of clonal colonies. Individual clones were then isolated and tested for 621 knockout efficiency by flow cytometry. 622 In vitro NOTCH1 induction: Human Treg cells from Healthy Donor were isolated by cell 623 sorting (Sony Sorter, MA900) based on CD3, CD4, CD25high, CD127Low. Treg cells were 624 seeded at 1×104cells in 96-well plates then stimulated with CD3/CD28 Dynabeads 625 (ThermoFisher) alone or in presence of recombinant IL-1b, IP-10, IL-6, IFN-g and IFN-l2 626 (10g/ml; Peprotech) for 72h. Notch1 expression on Foxp3+ Treg cells was then 627 assessed by Flow cytometry. 628 NUMB and NUMBL mutagenesis and cells transfection. A plasmid pCMV6-AC-Numb629 GFP encoding for human NUMB (NM_001005745) or human NUMBL (NM_004756) were 630 purchased from OriGene (RG209744). The directed NUMB (c.280 C>T, p.Leu 94 Phe) 631 and NUMBL (c.236G>T, p.Ser79Ile; c.262G>A p.Val88Met) mutagenesis plasmids were 632 generated with standard cloning techniques by using pCMV6-AC-Numb-GFP as a

633 template. NUMB/NUMBL-deficient HEK293T were cultured in 10% FBS DMEM medium 634 (Gibco), supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin 635 (Invitrogen). The day before transfection, the NUMB/NUMBL-deficient HEK293 cells were 636 seeded at a density of 5x105 cells per well of 6 well plates. The next day, HEK293 cells 637 were transiently transfected with 2 µg of the respective plasmids encoding either wild type 638 or mutant NUMB or NUMBL using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Merck Millipore) 639 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48h of transfection, cells were collected 640 for Flow cytometry analysis. 641 Cytokine measurements. IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IFNa, IFNb, IFNg, IFNl, CXCL10 and TNF 642 were measured using Legendplex (Biolegend) per manufacturer's protocol. 643 Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) mouse model. Mice were treated 644 intraperitoneally with 2.5 mg/kg of Poly I:C HMW (InvivoGen) every two days for 12 645 consecutive days. The weight of the mice was recorded daily. Mice were euthanized and 646 analyzed at day 13. For blockading CD22 mice were treated with an anti-CD22 antibody 647 every two days for 12 consecutive days (InVivoMAb anti-mouse CD22; Clone: Cy34.1, 648 Bioxcell). The antibody was given intra-peritoneally at 20 µg of antibody in PBS in a final 649 volume of 100 µl or isotype control mAb (clone MOPC-21; Bioxcell). For the CD20 650 depletion experiment, the mice were given intraperitoneally 10µg of anti-CD20mAB (clone 651 MB20-11; Bioxcell) or isotype control mAb (clone MOPC-21; Bioxcell) every 2 days, six 652 days before the start of the experiment. 653 Histopathology staining. Paraffin-embedded lung, colon and liver sections were stained 654 with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Paraffin-acid-Schiff staining (PAS). The lung colon 655 and liver pathology were scored by blinded operators, as described (74).

656 Flow cytometric analysis of mouse and human cells. Antibodies against murine and 657 human antigens used for flow cytometric analyses are described in Table S2. The 658 specificity and optimal dilution of each antibody were validated by testing on appropriate 659 negative and positive controls or otherwise provided on the manufacturer's website. 660 Intracellular cytokine staining was performed as previously described (41). Dead cells 661 were routinely excluded from the analysis based on the staining of eFluor 780 Fixable 662 Viability Dye (1:1000 dilution) (Thermofisher). Stained cells were analyzed on a BD LSR 663 Fortessa cell analyzer (BD Biosciences) and data were processed using Flowjo (Tree 664 Star Inc.).
665 Transcriptome Profiling. Treg cells were isolated from either Foxp3EGFPcre or 666 Foxp3EGFPCre Rosa26N1c/+ mice by cell sorting, and their RNA was isolated using Qiagen 667 RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA was then converted into double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), 668 using SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit (Clontech). dsDNA was then fragmented 669 to 200-300 bp size, using M220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris), and utilized for 670 construction of libraries for Illumina sequencing using KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Kapa 671 Biosystems). Libraries were then quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS (High Sensitivity) 672 Assay Kit on Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer. Detailed procedures are described 673 in Supplementary Material section. 674 In vitro suppression assays. Mouse and human Treg cell suppressive assay were 675 performed as described (74). Treg cells of Foxp3EGFPcre and Foxp3EGFPCre Rosa26N1c/+ 676 mice were cell sorted based on CD4, YFP and/or CD22 expression and were used as 677 suppressor cells. Responder cells were co-cultured with Treg cells, at a 1:1 ratio, and 678 stimulated at 37ºC 5% CO2 for 3 days with 2 g/ml of coated anti-CD3 and 1 g/ml of

679 soluble anti-CD28 in presence of increased dose of anti-CD22 mAb or Rapamycin in 96680 well, round-bottomed plates in triplicates. For human suppression assays Treg cells 681 (CD3+CD4+CD127-CD25High) and CD4+ Tconv (responder) cells were isolated from 682 PBMCs by cell sorting. Responder cells were co-cultured with Treg cells, at a 1:1 ratio, 683 and stimulated at 37ºC 5% CO2 for 3 days with 2 g/ml of coated anti-CD3 and 1 g/ml 684 of soluble anti-CD28 in presence of 1 g/ml anti-CD22 mAb or 1 ng/ml Rapamycin in 96685 well, round-bottomed plates in triplicates. The responder cells were then analyzed for 686 CellTrace dye dilution by flow cytometry. 687 Analysis of TCR signaling by phosphoflow. Total spleen from either Foxp3EGFPCre or 688 Foxp3EGFPCreR26N1c/N1c mice were stimulated at 37°C in non-supplemented RPMI 1640 689 using pre- formed complexes of biotinylated anti-CD3 mAb (clone 145-2C11, BD, 30 690 g/ml), anti-CD4 mAb (GK1.5, BD, 30 g/ml) and streptavidin (60 g/ml) during 1 to 5 691 min. Reaction was stopped and cells were permeabilized using a Foxp3/transcription 692 factor staining buffer (eBiosciences) and Perm buffer III (BD Biosciences). Cells were 693 stained with antibodies described in Table S2. Samples were acquired on a Fortessa 694 cytometer (BD) and data were analyzed using the FlowJo software. 695 Statistical analysis. Student's two-tailed t-test, one- and two-way ANOVA and repeat 696 measures two-way ANOVA with post-test analysis and log-rank test of groups were used 697 to compare test groups, as indicated. Linear Regression was used for correlation 698 analysis. For analysis of the human data, summary statistics were calculated using 699 number (percentage) for binary and categorical data and mean (standard deviation) or 700 median (interquartile range) for continuous data depending on the normality of the 701 distribution.

Abstract: Consecutive mRNA vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 reinforced both innate and adaptive immune responses. However, it remains unclear whether the enhanced innate immune responses are mediated by epigenetic regulation and, if so, whether these effects persist. Using mass cytometry, RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq, we show that BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination upregulated antiviral and IFN-stimulated gene expression in monocytes with greater effects after the second vaccination than those after the first vaccination. Transcription factor-binding motif analysis also revealed enriched IFN regulatory factors and PU.1 motifs in accessible chromatin regions. Importantly, although consecutive BNT162b2 mRNA vaccinations boosted innate immune responses and caused epigenetic changes in isolated monocytes, we showed that these effects occur only transiently and disappear 4 weeks after the second vaccination. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that a similar gene signature was impaired in the monocytes of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. These results reinforce the importance of the innate immune response in the determination of COVID19 severity but indicate that, unlike adaptive immunity, innate immunity is not unexpectedly sustained even after consecutive vaccination. This study, which focuses on innate immmune memory, may provide novel insights into the vaccine development against infectious diseases.

Main text: Introduction Since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in December 2019, nearly 300 million people have been infected, and by the end of 2021, more than 5 million people had died. Over 40% of the world's population has been vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as part of the effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the available vaccines, messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines that encode the SARSCoV-2 spike protein, including the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna), were among the first administered and have shown significant efficacy (1).
SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce the SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific antibody and Tcell responses (2-4). The boost in antibody production provided by revaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine and the long-term persistence of memory B- and T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 indicate the formation of adaptive immune memory (3, 5). Interestingly, the innate immune response is also reinforced after the second vaccination, as shown by an observed increase in the frequency of CD14+CD16+ monocytes and enhancement of the interferon (IFN)stimulated gene response in a myeloid cell cluster (CD14+BDCA1+PD-L1+ cells), which is a heterogeneous mix of classical monocytes, a classical dendritic cell (DC) subtype, and intermediate monocytes (5). However, it is unclear whether the enhanced innate immune responses after the second vaccination are associated with innate immune memory, and if so, how long the memory persists in the immune cells.
Innate immune memory, also termed "trained immunity," is an immunological memory that involves functional changes in innate immune cells after infection or vaccination, showing increased response to restimulation, which is similar to B- and T-cells' adaptive immune
6

memory (6-8). Trained immunity is characterized by epigenetic reprogramming in innate immune cells such as monocytes (9, 10) and natural killer (NK) cells (11) after infection or vaccination. Particularly, the live-attenuated bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine (9, 12), influenza vaccine (13, 14), and inactivated mucosal vaccine (15) induce epigenetic changes in monocytes, exerting protective effects against viral infections. Despite these findings, it is still unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce a similar alteration.
In this study, we reveal that BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine induces epigenetic changes in monocytes after the first vaccination, which result in an enhanced type I IFN response at the time of the second vaccination. Importantly, however, we show that this effect is transient and diminishes 28 days after the second vaccination.
Results The vaccinated cohort displays typical adaptive immune signatures and notable innate immune responses To investigate the immune response induced by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, healthy health care workers with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and no previous vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled (n = 11, all male, age range: 31-42 years) (Supplemental Table 1). The participants received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine injected into the deltoid muscle at a 3-week interval (30 µg/dose, Day (D) 0 and D21). Blood samples were collected prior to the first vaccination (D0) and on D1, 10, 20, 22, 31, and 49 after the initial vaccination (Figure 1A).
To confirm that the results from studying this cohort would be applicable to the general situation among the wider population, previously demonstrated changes in the adaptive immune
7

response were confirmed before evaluating the innate immune response: immunization with two doses of BNT162b2 significantly increased the levels of serum neutralizing antibodies and serum IgG, IgA, and IgM class antibodies, which bind to the spike protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD) regions of SARS-CoV-2 (Supplemental Figure 1, A and B), and the results of an IFN-g enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay indicated that immunization enhanced the T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptides (Supplemental Figure 1C). These results indicated that the vaccination cohort participants responded to the vaccination as expected.
To further investigate the immune responses after the first and second vaccinations, we measured the serum levels of 21 cytokines and chemokines related to antiviral and inflammatory responses using a bead-based immunoassay before (D0) and after (D1 and D22) the vaccinations (Supplemental Figure 2A). We observed robust induction of IFN-g and CXCL-10 in serum after the second vaccination compared to after the first vaccination (Supplemental Figure 2B). These cytokines and chemokines play an important role in promoting the innate immune responses involved in the effective development of humoral immunity after the boost immunization (16). Collectively, the enhanced immune response resulting from the boost immunization suggests that the innate immune responses may change after the initial vaccination.
The type I IFN response of monocytes is more robust at the time of the second vaccination than at the time of the first We next investigated the effect of the vaccine on immune cell populations after the first and second vaccine doses with cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) using white blood cells (WBCs) collected from four participants among those described in the previous subsection at all seven time points described in the study design (Supplemental Figure 3A). Self-organizing map
8

(FlowSOM) clustering of CyTOF data was used to classify the WBCs into ten major immune subsets (Supplemental Figure 3B). In the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) population, the proportion of myeloid cells (monocytes and DC) only showed an increasing trend on the day after the first and second vaccinations compared with the day before vaccination (Supplemental Figure 3C). We next classified monocytes into classical monocytes (cMono), intermediate monocytes (intMono), and nonclassical monocytes (ncMono) (Supplemental Figure 3D). The proportion of cMono was significantly more elevated after the second vaccination than after the first vaccination (Figure 1B). The expression levels of type  IFN receptor (IFNab_R2) on cMono were also more significantly upregulated on the day after the second dose than on the day after the first dose (Figure 1C). Additionally, the expression levels of Fcg receptor 1 (FcgR1) and ICAM-1 (CD54), previously found to be induced on monocytes by IFNs or inflammatory cytokines (17-19), were more highly expressed on monocytes after the second dose than after the first dose (Supplemental Figure 3, E and F). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine stimulated monocytes more strongly after the second immunization than after the first immunization.
To evaluate the enhanced immune responses of monocytes in more detail, we performed transcriptome analysis of monocytes before and after the first (D0 vs. D1) and second (D20 vs. D22) vaccination (Figure 1D). The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after the first vaccination (D1) relative to prevaccination (D0) was 165 (upregulated, 144; downregulated, 21), whereas the number of DEGs after the second vaccination (D22) was 724 (upregulated, 532; downregulated, 192) (Figure 1E). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the upregulated genes revealed many immune response terms common to the samples obtained after the first and second vaccinations (D1 and D22), such as antiviral and type  IFN responses (Figure 1F). These
9

genes, including CXCL10, IL6, FCGR1, and ICAM1, were more significantly upregulated on D22 than on D1 (Supplemental Figure 4), consistent with the data from the bead-based immunoassay of serum and CyTOF analysis. These results indicate that the antiviral and type I IFN-specific innate immune transcriptional responses are enhanced in monocytes after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination and that this response is more notable and widespread after the second vaccination than after the first vaccination.
The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine induces transient epigenetic changes in monocytes To investigate whether the enhanced type I IFN signaling in monocytes observed after the second vaccination resulted from epigenetic reprogramming, we performed a transposaseaccessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) assay to assess genomewide chromatin accessibility (19). We were particularly interested in assessing whether any changes in monocyte persisted after the second vaccination. To perform this analysis, we isolated monocytes from the PBMCs obtained from five participants, including the four subjects for CyTOF and RNA-seq analysis, before and after each vaccination dose (D0, D1, D20, D22, and D49) (Figure 2A) and detected 1544, 1045, 1070, and 1473 differentially accessible regions (DARs) on D1, D20, D22, and D49 compared with D0, respectively (Figure 2B). The hierarchical clustering of the normalized peak reads illustrated changes in the chromatin accessibility of monocytes after vaccination (Figure 2C). Enrichment analysis of all the nearest genes in a cluster showed terms related to innate immune responses in clusters 1 and 2 , especially cluster 1 (Figure 2D and Supplemental Figure 5A). Additionally, protein-protein interaction (PPI) enrichment analysis among genes in cluster 1 revealed a densely connected network of immune responses, such as IFN signaling and response to virus (Figure 2 E and
10

Supplemental Figure 5B). Especially, the modules in MCODE2 showed a strong association with type I IFN-mediated antiviral responses: IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 7 is the master regulator of type I IFN production (20), and ISG factor 3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1, STAT2, and IRF9) activates downstream type I IFN signaling and induces the expression of antiviral effector ISGs (IFN induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) 1, myxovirus resistance protein 1 (MX1), IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) 2, IFIT3, and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2)) (21). In contrast, in clusters 3 and 4, the term and PPI networks related to innate immune responses were not detected (Supplemental Figure 5, C and D). Cluster 1 showed the chromatin accessibilities of several antiviral and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that increased at D1, decreased at D20 but remained higher than those at D0, and increased again at D22 (Figure 2F). Interestingly, we observed a reduction in the chromatin accessibility at D49 back to the levels at D0 (Figure 2, C and F), indicating that these epigenomic changes did not persist.
Furthermore, hypergeometric optimization of motif enrichment (HOMER) motif searches among open peaks revealed that IFN-stimulated response element-like motifs were more accessible on D1, D20, and D22 and that transcription factor (TF)-binding motifs associated with IRFs and PU.1 were enriched in monocytes at the same timepoints (Figure 2G). These TFbinding motifs, known to cooperate with each other to activate antiviral defense programs (22), were most significantly enriched after the second vaccination (D22) (Figure 2G). Notably, they were enriched in open peaks on D20 but not on D49 (Figure 2G). Additionally, PU.1 and multiple AP-1 member motifs, including Fosl2, Jun-AP1, and JunB, were significantly detected in closing peaks on D49 according to HOMER analysis (Supplemental Figure 5E). These results suggest that epigenetic reprogramming in monocytes may be involved in the enhanced innate
11

immune response seen after the second immunization. Additionally, they indicate that these primed immune responses, including the type I IFN response of monocytes, returned to prevaccination levels 28 days after the second immunization.
Epigenetic changes in monocytes are linked to their functions To clarify the functional effects of the epigenetic changes on monocytes, we isolated monocytes from the PBMCs of participants prior to the first vaccination, at D20, and at D49 and stimulated the isolated monocytes with R848. R848 is a ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR8, which mimics viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (such as single-stranded RNA, which is present during SARS-CoV-2 infection). After 24 h of stimulation, we measured the levels of secreted cytokines in culture supernatants using bead-based immunoassays (Figure 3A). In the culture supernatant, the level of IFN-a2, a type I IFN, was elevated to a greater extent at D20 and returned almost to baseline at D49 (Figure 3B). Additionally, the same trend was observed for type II and III IFNs (IFN-g and IFN-l2/3, respectively) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL1b, IL-6, TNF-a, and GM-CSF) (Supplemental Figure 6A), although not for IFN-b, another type I IFN (Figure 3B). These results revealed that the initial vaccination enhanced TLR7/8 responses in monocytes.
To investigate changes in the rapid type I IFN response before and after vaccination, we examined antiviral and ISG expression at multiple points. We stimulated monocytes isolated from the PBMCs of participants with R848 for 6 and 24 hours and quantitated the gene expression at each time point using real-time PCR. The target gene expression at 24 hours was not significantly different before and after vaccination; however, the rapid type I IFN response at 6 hours was stronger in monocytes on D20 (Figure 3C and Supplemental Figure 6B). In
12

particular, APOBEC3A, IFITM1, GBP1, GBP5, and FCGR1 responded rapidly in monocytes isolated on D20; however, these enhanced responses were attenuated in monocytes isolated on D49 (Figure 3C and Supplemental Figure 6B). These effects are consistent with the chromatin accessibility changes between D20 and D49 revealed by ATAC-seq (Figure 2F). These results indicate that the initial vaccination with the mRNA vaccine induced epigenomic changes in monocytes and that the second vaccination increased the innate immune response, at least partly, via regulation of DNA accessibility at specific inflammation-related loci; however, these changes were not sustained at longer time points after the second vaccination.
Type I IFN responses of monocytes are impaired in unvaccinated severe COVID-19 patients We showed that innate immune responses, particularly antiviral and IFN responses, were induced in monocytes by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. However, the biological relevance of these innate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. We aimed to identify IFN signatures associated with COVID-19 severity using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients and to investigate the similarity between these gene clusters and those induced by BNT162b2.
To explore the importance of the innate immune system in the prevention of severe disease, we analyzed the expression of genes associated with disease severity in the PBMCs of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n =8 per group) and unvaccinated healty donors (HDs) without SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 5) (Fugure 4A, Supplemental Table 2). After applying quality control filters and merging the samples, 119,293 high-quality single cells were obtained for the scRNA-seq analysis and
13

manually classified into 13 clusters (Supplemental Figure 7, A and B). A total of 19,289 single innate immune cells (myeloid cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC)) were ultimately included, which were classified into five clusters (cMono, intMono, ncMono, DC, and pDC) (Supplemental Figure 7, C and D). We detected 2187, 698, and 658 significant DEGs between patients with ARDS-complicated COVID-19 patients and non-ARDS COVID-19 patients in the cMono, intMono, and ncMono clusters, respectively. The expression of antiviral genes and ISGs was upregulated in COVID-19 patients compared with that in the HDs (Supplemental Figure 7E); however, these expression levels in patients with ARDS were downregulated compared with those in non-ARDS patients (Fugure 4B), indicating that an impaired type I IFN response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with severe COVID-19, consistent with previous reports (23-25).
The innate immunity-related genes downregulated during severe COVID-19 are associated with those upregulated by mRNA vaccination Next, we investigated the similarities between the gene signatures associated with COVID-19 severity and those induced by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, as revealed in our vaccine cohort study described above. A total of 413 (22.7%), 184 (10.1%), and 175 (9.62%) genes among the DEGs (1820 genes) identified in the monocytes from the vaccine cohort were also present among the DEGs observed in the cMono, intMono, and ncMono in the COVID-19 cohort, respectively (Supplemental Figure 7F). Interestingly, the genes upregulated by BNT162b2 showed strong commonality with those downregulated in monocytes of ARDS patients with COVID-19, while the genes downregulated by BNT162b2 shared little overlap with those in COVID-19 patients' monocytes (Figure 4C). In particular, several genes that play an important role in antiviral
14

responses, such as APOBEC3A (26, 27), GBP family genes (28, 29), and IFITM family genes (30, 31), were identified in the shared gene set (Figure 4D, E, and F). Indeed, enrichment analysis of DEGs in monocytes revealed that innate immune responses, such as response to virus and IFN signaling, were enriched for up- and downregulated genes in the vaccine cohort and the COVID-19 cohort, respectively (Supplemental Figure 7G). These findings suggest that the innate immune responses of monocytes induced by BNT162b2 mRNA may be involved in the prevention of COVID-19 severity.
Discussion In this study, consecutive vaccination with BNT162b2 mRNA was found to enhance both adaptive and innate immune responses; however, the enhancement of innate immunity was not sustained. The genes that upregulated after vaccination were strongly related to those downregulated during severe COVID-19 infection.
Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, it was hypothesized that long-term enhancement of the innate immune response, known as "trained immunity," via the epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells after BCG vaccination may contribute to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity (32). In this study, ATAC-seq of monocytes showed increased accessibility of chromatin regions associated with ISG expression after the second vaccination, but these changes disappeared after only 4 weeks later. Thus, this observation may indicate innate immune cells displaying a form of "short-term epigenetic memory" (33, 34). In particular, we observed a transient enhancement of type I IFN responses after vaccinations. Type I IFNs play an important role not only in the host defense against viruses (35), but also in the development and maintainance of adaptive immunity, including B- and T-cell responses (36, 37).
15

Regarding the humoral immune response, type I IFNs directly activate B cells, promoting antibody production during viral infections (38). Similarly to the effect observed during viral infection, the enhanced innate immune responses resulting from mRNA vaccination are associated with the production of neutralizing antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 (5). On the other hand, persistent type I IFN production may lead to failure to maintain higher antibody titers (39) or improper autoantibody production resulting in autoimmune disease (40). Although the enrichment analysis on the gene set in cluster 4 of ATAC-seq showed no significant pathways associated with immune responses, chromatin accessibility at the CXCL13 locus was still increased 28 days after the second vaccination, suggesting that the innate immune memory induced by mRNA vaccines may promote B cell maturation and antibody responses and help develop a rapid host defense against natural infection (41, 42). Taken together, these results indicate that the innate immunity induced by mRNA vaccines may not be directly involved in the long-term prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection but instead play an important role in driving adaptive immunity, including the production of antigen-specific antibodies. However, there is insufficient evidice to explain if the short-term innate immune memory induced by mRNA vaccines remains; thus, further research is needed to address this question.
To investigate the factors contributing to the severity of COVID-19, we assessed the role of innate immunity in severe disease using a cohort of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients. In this unvaccinated cohort, the expression of IFN-stimulated genes in monocytes was markedly reduced in patients presenting with ARDS. Type  IFN is an important cytokine for the activation of Th1 and NK cells, which function to eliminate virus-infected cells (43). Indeed, impaired type  IFN responses (23) and preexisting autoantibodies against type  IFN (44, 45) have been shown to be associated with the severity of COVID-19. On the other hand, it has also been
16

reported that hypoxemia complicated with ARDS causes monocytopenia and suppression of type I IFN signaling in mice (46) and that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 (47) and nucleocapsid proteins (48) suppress type I IFN signaling in vitro. These suggest that the lower type I IFN responses to SARS-CoV-2 may be both a cause and a consequence of severe COVID-19. In any event, type I IFN signaling is essential as a viral restriction mechanism; its successful response may help limit the occurence of other risk factors for severe COVID-19 such as cytokine storm (49). Interestingly, the gene set downregulated in patients with COVID-19 with ARDS was similar to the gene set strongly induced in monocytes by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine; this means that the innate immune responses induced by mRNA vaccines may compensate for the decreased IFN responses in patients with severe COVID-19. Therefore, to ensure the prevention of severe COVID-19 after a second or third vaccination dose, activating and sustaining innate immune responses, including the IFN response, may be important. Further investigations are needed to assess not only the dynamics of neutralizing antibody titers but also the effects on innate immunity, such as the IFN response, to determine the optimal dosing intervals for mRNA vaccines.
It is important to take into consideration interactions between innate and adaptive immune responses. In fact, polyfunctional CD4 T cells producing IL-2, IFN-g, TNF-a, and/or IL-4 remained abundant in the peripheral blood immediately before the second vaccination (5). In mice, the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine induced the remaining antigen-specific tissueresident T cells to produce IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-2 in the lung or spleen immediately before the second vaccination (50). It is possible that these differences in adaptive immunity could be responsible for the epigenomic changes and the enhancement of innate immune responses in monocytes just after the second vaccination. However, despite these changes in adaptive
17

immunity observed after the second vaccination (D42) (5), we could not detect an increase in chromatin accessibility in monocytes involved in the innate immune responses at D49, as described above. Further investigation is warranted to reveal the involvement of persistent epigenetic changes (13, 51) in the systemic immune responses to an mRNA vaccine.
Our report has the following limitations. The first is that the sample size was small; therefore, individual effects may have affected the analysis results. Second, all participants were male and sex was therefore not considered in our study. Females have a stronger humoral immune response to the vaccine than males, and higher antibody titers are reportedly induced by BNT162b2 in females (52). Additionally, the IFN-a2 plasma levels induecd by BNT162b2 are likely higher in females than in males (5). Further investigations are warranted to understand the impact of these differences in immune responses between females and males on epigenetic reprogramming in innate immune cells. Third, this study was a short-term observation, extending 49 days after the first immunization. It has been reported that the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection gradually decreases after the second vaccination (53) and that a third dose of mRNA vaccine improves the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 due to enhanced adaptive immune responses (54, 55). However, it is unclear how the epigenomics of the innate immune system changes during subsequent vaccination and whether this contributes to the booster effect; therefore, further longitudinal observation will be needed. Forth, our transcriptional and epigenomic analyses were not performed at single-cell level. A previous report has shown that the responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine vary between monocytes subsets (5). In our study, whether the similar gene signatures found between the vaccine cohort and COVID-19 cohort are shared among the same monocyte subsets remains an open question. Finally, we only analyzed circulating monocytes.
18

Long-lasting innate memory is observed in tissue-resident macrophages (8). In our study, it remains unclear whether the mRNA vaccines act on tissue-resident macrophages resulting in long-term innate immune memory.
We provide evidence of activating alterations in innate immune response-related genes with epigenetic changes in monocytes induced by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and reveal that these effects are transient (Supplemental Figure 8). In the future, considering the importance of innate immune responses against viral infections, clarifying the long-term effects of consecutive mRNA vaccine doses on innate immune memory may lead to new strategies to combat viral infections.
Methods Research participants We recruited participants into two cohorts. All participants were enrolled after providing written informed consent, and the study was approved by the local ethics committee of Osaka University Hospital (IRB no. 20118-4) or Osaka University (IRB no. 734-9).
For the first cohort, to evaluate the immune response induced by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, participants were recruited from March 15, 2021 to June 7, 2021 on Osaka University Hospital. All the participants were healthy health care workers with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and no previous vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 (n = 11, all male, age range: 31-42 years). We collected serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and white blood cells (WBCs) from them on D0, 1, 10, 20, 22, 31, and 49. These volunteers were then immunized with two doses (30 µg/dose) of the mRNA vaccine at 3-week intervals according to the normal protocols of the facility.
19

For the second cohort, to analyze the single-cell transcriptome of peripheral blood cells, unvaccinated COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 8) or without ARDS (n = 8) who were admitted to Osaka University Medical Hospital between December 2019 and October 2021 and unvaccinated healthy donors (n =5) different from the firist cohort were included. We collected PBMCs from COVID-19 patients when they were admitted to our hospital. For the COVID-19 patients with ARDS, PBMCs were collected during ARDS status.
Isolation and storage of serum and PBMCs For serum collection, peripheral blood samples were allowed to stand for 15 min at room temperature, centrifuged at 1000×g for 15 min, and stored at -80°C until use. PBMCs were isolated from fresh whole blood collected in heparin-coated tubes by density gradient centrifugation using Leucosep (Greiner Bio-One, 227288-013) according to the instruction manual, and isolated PBMCs were stored in CELLBANKER cell freezing medium (Nippon Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd., 11910) at -80°C until use.
Serum SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody quantification The concentration of serum SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) was measured using an iFlash3000 (Shenzhen Yhlo Biotech Co., Ltd., YH-C6111) fully automated chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) analyzer and an iFlash-2019-nCoV NAb Kit (Shenzhen Yhlo Biotech Co., Ltd., YH-C86109) according to the manufacturer's protocols. This kit consists of a one-step competitive assay to measure the binding inhibition activity by antibodies against the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),
20

which serves as a receptor for viral entry. The 4-point calibrator in this kit was used to generate a calibration curve. The results are reported as inhibitory activity in arbitrary units/milliliter (AU/mL), and the cutoff value was set at 10.0 AU/mL (10 AU/mL: positive, <10 AU/mL: negative). All the above processes were automated, and the results were obtained in a highthroughput manner by simply loading 150 L of each serum sample into the iFlash3000.
Serum SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific antibody measurement IgG, IgA and IgM against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunits S1 and S2 and the spike RBD in serum collected from vaccinated participants (n = 11) were quantified by a multiplex beadbinding assay using Milliplex technology (Millipore, HC19SERM1-85K, HC19SERG1-85K, HC19SERA1-85K) following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 25 µL of diluted serum sample (1:100) was mixed with 25 µL of bead mixture (3 antigen-immobilized beads and 3 control beads) in a 96-well plate containing 25 µL of assay buffer per well. After incubation on a plate shaker (600 rpm) for 2 h at room temperature, the plates were washed 3 times with wash buffer using a Handheld Magnetic Microplate Washer (Bio-Rad), and 50 µL of PE-conjugated anti-human IgG, IgA, or IgM was added to each well. After incubation on a plate shaker (600 rpm) for 90 min, the plates were washed 3 times with wash buffer as described above, and then sheath fluid was added to each well for reading on a Bio-Plex 200 System (Bio-Rad). Fifty events per bead were counted, and median fluorescent intensity (MFI) data were analyzed with Bio-Plex Manager Software with default parameters (Bio-Rad) (version 6.2). The MFIs of the background wells were subtracted from the MFIs of the sample wells. The results were evaluated relative to the degree of increase in the MFIs compared to the MFIs before vaccination.
21

Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific T-cell responses were assessed using a human IFN-g/IL-4 Double-Color FluoroSpot assay (CTL, hT2003F) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 150,000/well PBMCs collected from vaccinated participants (n = 11) were incubated with 2.0 µg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S1 scanning pools (MABTECH, 3629-1) for 48 h at 37°C and in 5% CO2. The plates were analyzed using an ImmunoSpot S6 MACRO Analyzer (CTL), and the number of spot-forming units (SFU) was automatically calculated using ImmunoCapture software (version 7.0.7.3). The number of spots in negative control wells was subtracted from the number of spots in test wells, and the results are displayed as SFUs.
Serum cytokine measurements Cytokines in serum obtained from vaccinated participants (n = 11) were quantified using a LEGENDplex Human Anti-Virus Response Panel (13-plex) (BioLegend, 740390) and a Human B-Cell Panel (13-plex) (BioLegend, 740527) according to the default protocols. In brief, the samples and standards were incubated with premixed beads on a plate shaker (800 rpm) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with 1× wash buffer, they were reacted with a detection antibody on a plate shaker (800 rpm) for one hour at room temperature, and then PE-conjugated beads were added and reacted on a plate shaker (800 rpm) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with 1× wash buffer, the samples were read on a flow cytometer using a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences). The FCS files were analyzed using the LEGENDplex Data Analysis Software Suite (BioLegend), an online cloud-based program (https://legendplex.qognit.com/).
Immune profiling of peripheral whole blood using mass cytometry
22

A Maxpar Direct Immune Profiling Assay (Fluidigm, Cat# 201325) was used for immune profiling of peripheral whole blood according to the manufacturer's protocol. In addition to the 30 premixed marker antibodies, antibodies specific for 13 markers, IFN-a/bR2, IFN-a/bR1, neuropilin-1, ICAM-1, Fcg-RI, CXCR1, FCAR, CD147, CD44, semaphorin 4D, semaphorin 6D, CXCR2, and PD-L1, were added (Supplemental Table 3). In brief, whole blood was incubated with a 100 U/mL heparin solution (Sigma Aldrich, Cat# H3149) to reduce nonspecific antibody binding at room temperature. After 20 min, aliquots consisting of 270 µL of whole blood and 3 µL of each additional antibody were placed in heparin-coated tubes containing a dry antibody pellet and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After staining, red blood cells were lysed with 250 µL of Cal-Lyse lysing solution (Invitrogen, Cat# GAS010S100) and 3 mL of Maxpar Water (Fluidigm) for 10 min each at room temperature. After lysis, the cells were washed 3 times with Cell Staining Buffer (CSB) (Fluidigm). Then, the cells were fixed with 1 mL of 1.6% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and incubated with 125 nM Cell-ID Intercalator-Ir dissolved in Maxpar Fix and Perm Buffer (Fluidigm). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the cells were washed with CSB and Cell Acquisition Solution (CAS) (Fluidigm) and resuspended in CAS containing 0.1x EQ Four Element Calibration Beads at a cell concentration of 1×106 cells/mL. After filtering the cells through a 35 µm cell strainer, data were acquired using a Helios (Fluidigm). The acquired FCS files were normalized with CyTOF Software (version 7.0.8493).
Mass cytometry data analysis Mass cytometry data analysis was conducted in R (version 4.0.3) using the following packages. FlowSOM clustering and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) were
23

performed using Catalyst (version 1.14.1). WBC-level clustering was performed using the markers CD3, CD4, CD8a, CD19, CD14, CD16, CD11c, CD56, CD161, CD123, TCRgd, CD66b, HLA-DR, FcgR1_CD64, and CD294. To exclude DCs from monocytes, clustering was performed using CD11c, CD14, HLA-DR, CD16, FCAR_CD89, CD38, CD294, CD45, ICAM1_CD54, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD147, FcgR1_CD64, and Sema4D. Monocyte clustering was performed using CD11c, CD14, CD16, HLA-DR, CD38, CD45RA, CD45RO, FcgR1_CD64, PD-L1, and ICAM-1_CD54. All plots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.3.5). Statistical tests were performed using rstatix (version 0.7.0). The R script is available on Github: https://github.com/jonasns/tmVac
Monocyte isolation Monocytes were isolated from frozen PBMCs collected from participants in the vaccine study by an indirect magnetic labeling system using a Pan Monocyte Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 130096-537) following the manufacturer's protocol. This kit is capable of simultaneously isolating classical monocytes (CD14++CD16-), intermediate monocytes (CD14++CD16+), and nonclassical monocytes (CD14+CD16++). In brief, frozen PBMCs were thawed and washed twice with RPMI 1640 (NACALAI TESQUE, 30264-85) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, 10500064). After resuspension in PBS supplemented with 2 mM EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, the PBMCs were incubated at 4°C for 5 min with FcR Blocking Reagent and BiotinAntibody Cocktail, a cocktail of monoclonal anti-human antibodies against antigens that are not expressed on human monocytes. After the reaction, anti-biotin microbeads were added to the PBMCs and allowed to react for 10 min at 4°C. Unlabeled monocytes were collected by depletion of the magnetically labeled cells using a MACS cell separation system (Miltenyi
24

Biotec). The purity of the isolated monocytes was assessed by a flow cytometer using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Isolated monocytes were used for the analysis of RNA-seq (n = 4), ATAC-seq (n = 5), and the restimulation experiment (n = 4) as described below.
RNA-seq of isolated monocytes Total RNA was extracted from the monocytes isolated from PBMCs (Day 0, Day 1, Day 20, and Day 22) as described above using a miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 217004) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, isolated monocytes were homogenized with QIAzol Lysis Reagent (QIAGEN, 79306), followed by separation of the aqueous phase using chloroform. The separated sample was mixed with 1.5 volumes of 100% ethanol, and the mixture was transferred into an RNeasy Mini spin column. After washing the column with Buffer RWT and Buffer RPE in turn, total RNA was eluted from the column by RNase-free water. The quality and quantity were assessed using an Agilent2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Full-length cDNA was generated using a SMART-Seq HT Kit (Takara Bio, 634436) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An Illumina library was prepared using a Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, FC-131-1096) according to the SMARTer Kit instructions. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina) in 101-base paired-end mode.
RNA-seq preprocessing The quality of raw paired-end sequencing reads was assessed using FastQC (56) with default parameters (version 0.11.7; https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Lowquality (<20) bases and adaptor sequences were trimmed with Trimmomatic software (57)
25

(version 0.38) with the following parameters: ILLUMINACLIP: path/to/adapter.fa:2:30:10, LEADING: 20, TRAILING: 20, SLIDINGWINDOW: 4:15, and MINLEN: 36. The trimmed reads were aligned to the hg38 reference genome using the RNA-seq aligner HISAT2 (58) (version 2.1.0). The HISAT2-resultant.sam files were converted into.bam files with Samtools (59) and used to estimate the abundance of uniquely mapped reads with featureCounts (60) (version 1.6.3). The raw counts were normalized to transcripts per million (TPM) (61).
RNA-seq data analysis Based on the normalized counts, we performed comparison analyses among samples by hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis, and scatter plot and heatmap construction. A tree diagram was produced by hierarchical clustering with the Wald method using each pair of Euclidean distances. A 2-D plane based on the first and second principal components was created by PCA. The Pearson's correlation coefficients of each gene were calculated, and scatter plots of comparisons between samples were constructed. Using the stats (version 3.6.1) and gplots (version 3.0.1.1) R packages, a heatmap was created by calculating the Z scores of the TPMs for each gene. Analysis of the differential gene expression in monocytes was performed on samaples colleted immediately before and after vaccination (Day 1 versus Day 0 and Day 22 versus Day 20). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in monocytes were detected using DESeq2 (62, 63) (version 1.24.0) with the thresholds of |log2FC (fold change)| > 1 and an adjusted p value (p.adjust) < 0.05 calculated by the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) method (64). Gene Ontology terms with p.adjust < 0.05 determined by the BH method were extracted with DAVID (65, 66) (version 1.22.0).

ATAC-seq of isolated monocytes Samples for ATAC-seq analysis were prepared from monocytes isolated from PBMCs (Day 0, Day 1, Day 20, Day 22, and Day 49) as described above. Libraries were prepared using an ATAC-Seq Kit (Active Motif, 53150) according to the manual. In brief, 100,000 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in ice-cold ATAC lysis buffer. After centrifugation at 500×g for 10 min at 4°C, the pellets were resuspended with Tagmentation Master Mix and incubated at 37°C for 30 min in a thermostatic mixer (800 rpm). After incubation, the samples were mixed with DNA Purification Binding Buffer and 3 M sodium acetate and transferred to a DNA purification column. After washing the column with wash buffer containing 80% ethanol, the samples were eluted with DNA Purification Elution Buffer. Following purification, we performed PCR amplification of tagmented DNA using 25 µM i7/i5 Indexed Primers, 10 mM dNTPs, 5× Q5 Reaction Buffer, and 2 U/µL Q5 Polymerase under the following PCR conditions: 72°C for 5 min; 98°C for 30 s; and ten cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 63°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min. After PCR amplification, the samples were purified using SPRI bead solution and eluted with 20 µL of DNA Purification Elution Buffer. The library quality and quantity were checked using a LabChip GX Touch HT (PerkinElmer) with an HT NGS 3K Reagent Kit (PerkinElmer), and the fragment size distribution was measured using qPCR with a KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina) in 150-base paired-end mode.
ATAC-seq preprocessing
27

FastQC (56) (version 0.11.5; https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) was used to check the overall sequence data quality with default parameters. Low-quality (< 20) bases and adapter sequences were trimmed by Trimmomatic software (57) (version 0.38) with the following parameters: ILLUMINACLIP: /path/to/adapter.fa:2:30:10, LEADING:20, TRAILING: 20, SLIDINGWINDOW: 4:15, and MINLEN: 36. Bowtie2 (67) (version 2.3.4.2) was applied to align the data to the hg38 human reference genome using the "-N 1 -X 2000 -U /path/to/sample_1_fq.gz,/path/to/sample_2_fq.gz" options. Samtools (58) was used to sort and remove the reads mapped to blacklisted regions of signal artifacts (68). The Samtoolsresultant.bam files were used to perform peak calling with MACS2 software (69) using the "-q 0.01-nomodel" options. The peaks of all samples were merged with "bedtools merge" (70). The abundance of the mapped reads was estimated with featureCounts (60) (version 1.6.3). The raw read counts were normalized to the trimmed mean of M values (TMM).
ATAC-seq data analysis Based on the normalized counts, we conducted comparative analyses of all samples by hierarchical clustering, PCA, correlation analysis and heatmap construction. Hierarchical clustering by the Wald method using each pair of Euclidean distances resulted in a tree diagram. Each sample was projected onto a 2-D plane of the first and second PCA axes. Scatter plots were constructed by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficients of each peak between a pair of samples. Heatmaps were created by calculating Z scores of the count data using the stats (version 3.6.1) and gplots (version 3.0.1.1) R packages. We then compared groups of samples to detect differential peak regions using the edgeR package (71) (version 1.24.0) with the threshold of |log2FC| > 1 and p.value < 0.05. The nearest genes from each peak were annotated by the
28

ChIPpeakAnno R package (72). Gene enrichment analysis of the nearest genes was performed using the Metascape online platform (73). Motif analysis of the differential peak regions was conducted with HOMER software (74).
Restimulation of isolated monocytes and quantification of cytokines in supernatants After isolating monocytes from PBMCs collected before (Day 0) and after (Day 20 and Day 49) vaccination as described above, 1×105 cells per well were cultured with RPMI 1640 (NACALAI TESQUE, 30264-85) and 100 ng/mL R848 (InvivoGen, tlrl-r848) in 96-well flat bottom plates (Nunc) for 6 h or 24 h at 37°C and in 5% CO2. After centrifugation at 300×g for 5 min, the supernatant was transferred to another plate to perform a cytokine quantification assay, and the cells were resuspended in 350 µL of buffer RL containing 143 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (NIPPON Genetics Co. Ltd., FG-81250) for RNA extraction and subsequent qPCR. These samples were stored at -80°C until use. Cytokines in the supernatant were quantified using a LEGENDplex Human Anti-Virus Response Panel (13-plex) (BioLegend, 740390) as described above for serum cytokine quantification.
RNA extraction and qPCR for isolated monocyte restimulation RNA was extracted from monocytes stimulated with R848 as described above using a FastGene RNA Premium Kit (NIPPON Genetics Co., Ltd., FG-81250) and reverse transcribed with SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen, 11766500) following the manufacturer's instructions. qPCR was performed using PowerTrack SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, A46109) with a QuantStudio 7 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For all samples,
29

we determined the target quantity from a standard curve and normalized it to glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 4.
Preprocessing and Single-cell RNA-seq of COVID-19 patients samples PBMCs for scRNA-seq were obtained from patients with COVID-19 (ARDS complicated, n = 8; non-ARDS complicated, n = 8) and healthy donors (n = 5) as described above. Single-cell suspensions were loaded on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller according to the manufacturer's instructions for Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kits (v1.1 Chemistry), using a Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5 Library & Gel Bead Kit v1.1 (10x Genomics, PN1000167), Chromium Next GEM Chip G Single Cell Kit (10x Genomics, PN-1000127) and Single Index Kit T Set A (10x Genomics, PN-1000213). Following gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM) generation, cDNA with a cell barcode and unique molecular index (UMI) was produced from each encapsulated cell in an oil droplet by reverse transcription. After amplification of cDNA, the fragmentation, end repair, and polyA tagging steps were performed. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 in paired-end mode (read1: 26 bp; read2: 91 bp). The libraries were processed using Cell Ranger 5.0.0 (10x Genomics). Count matrices were constructed using dropEst (75) from BAM files obtained by alignment with STAR (76) using the GRCh38 human reference genome. Cells with less than 1,000 UMIs or more than 20,000 UMIs and cells containing more than 10% reads from mitochondrial or hemoglobin genes were filtered. Furthermore, for each sample, doublets identified by Scrublet (77) were removed.
Single-cell RNA-seq data analysis
30

The Seurat package in R (v3.2.2) was used to perform scaling, transformation, clustering, dimensionality reduction, differential expression analysis, and visualization (78). The SCTransform function was used to scale and transform the data, and linear regression was used to remove unwanted variability according to percentage mitochondrial reads. We identified "anchors" using the FindIntegrationAnchors function between individual datasets based on 3,000 shared highly variable genes (HVGs), which were identified using the SelectIntegrationFeatures function, and then we created a batch-corrected expression matrix of all cells by applying these anchors to the IntegrateData function. We performed PCA and UMAP dimension reduction with 30 principal components (79). We used the FindNeighbors function to calculate a nearestneighbor graph using the 30 dimensions of the PCA reduction and then used the FindClusters function for clustering. We determined the cellular identity by finding DEGs for each cluster using the FindMarkers function with the parameter "test.use=wilcox", and we obtained 13 cell clusters by comparing those markers to known cell type-specific genes. To analyze the subcluster of innate immune cells including myeloid cells, we extracted and reintegrated CD14+ monocytes, CD16+ monocytes, dendritic cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, following the procedure described above, except that 2,000 shared HVGs were used. After integration, clustering and cluster annotation were performed as described above, and five cell clusters were obtained. We performed differential expression analysis between COVID-19 patients with ARDS and nonARDS COVID-19 patients with the three subsets of monocytes (classical monocytes, intermediate monocytes, and nonclassical monocytes) using the FindMarkers function with the parameter "test.use=wilcox". Significant DEGs were defined with p.adjust < 0.05 calculated by the BH method (64). Gene enrichment analysis of the DEGs was performed using the Metascape online platform (73).

Restimulation of monocytes isolated from PBMCs on D0, D20, and D49 with R848 for 6 or 24 h (n =4 per group). All four individuals included in the ATAC-seq analysis (in Fig. 2) were included in the restimulation experiment. R848 is a ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR8, which mimics singlestranded RNA viral pathogens. (B) Concentrations of type I IFNs (IFN-a2 and IFN-b) in the culture supernatant after stimulation of isolated monocytes with R848 (100 ng/mL) for 24 h (D0, D20, and D49; n = 4 per group). Type I IFN levels were measured by a bead-based immunoassay. Each dot represents an individual. (C) Antiviral and IFN-stimulated gene (APOBEC3A, IFITM1, ISG15, GBP5, TNFSF10, and WARS) expression levels were quantified by qPCR before and after stimulation of isolated monocytes with R848 (100 ng/mL) for 6 and 24 h (left bars, D0; middle bars, D20; right bars, D49; n = 4 per group). The gene-expression levels were normalized to those of GAPDH. Each dot represents an individual. White, orange, and blue bars show no stimulation, 6 and 24 h after stimulation, respectively.

40 Abstract: 41 Background: We assessed the performance of CoronaCHEK lateral flow assay on samples from 42 Uganda and Baltimore to determine the impact of geographic origin on assay performance. 43 Methods: Serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ individuals (Uganda: 78 samples from 78 44 individuals and Baltimore: 266 samples from 38 individuals) and from pre-pandemic individuals 45 (Uganda 1077 and Baltimore 532) were evaluated. Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated to 46 identify factors associated with a false-positive test. 47 Results: After first positive PCR in Ugandan samples the sensitivity was: 45% (95% CI 24,68) at 48 0-7 days; 79% (95%CI 64,91) 8-14 days; and 76% (95%CI 50,93) >15 days. In samples from 49 Baltimore, sensitivity was: 39% (95% CI 30, 49) 0-7 days; 86% (95% CI 79,92) 8-14 days; and 50 100% (95% CI 89,100) 15 days post positive PCR. The specificity of 96.5% (95% CI 97.5,95.2) in 51 Ugandan samples was significantly lower than samples from Baltimore 99.3% (95% CI 52 98.1,99.8), p<0.01. In Ugandan samples, individuals with a false positive result were more likely 53 to be male (PR 2.04, 95% CI 1.03,3.69) or individuals who had a fever more than a month prior 54 to sample acquisition (PR 2.87, 95% CI 1.12,7.35). 55 Conclusions: Sensitivity of the CoronaCHEK was similar in samples from Uganda and Baltimore. 56 The specificity was significantly lower in Ugandan samples than in Baltimore samples. False 57 positive results in Ugandan samples appear to correlate with a recent history of a febrile illness, 58 potentially indicative of a cross-reactive immune response in individuals from East Africa.

59 INTRODUCTION

60

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes

61 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1), which has been detected on all continents and

62 continues to be a public health emergency globally (2). Critical to public health efforts to

63 combat the pandemic are accurate serologic assays to differentiate exposed from unexposed

64 individuals (3). Many studies investigate the performance of these assays on samples from Asia

65 (4), Western Europe (5), and the United States (6). However, little information is available on

66 the performance of these assays in an African setting, though initial studies provide evidence of

67 potential problems (7), particularly among febrile patients infected by other infectious

68 pathogens (8).

69

Serologic assays used for the detection of antibodies to different viral infections can

70 vary in performance based on the origin of the samples being tested, as has been seen in HIV

71 (9), HCV (10), and HSV-2 (11). It is thought that these differences in specificity result from host

72 genetics of the source population and the frequency and distribution of the infectious agents

73 exposed to the population (12). We sought to compare the performance of the CoronaCHEK

74 Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) on samples from Uganda and the United States to assess the impact of

75 geographic origin on the performance of this assay. Samples from known SARS-CoV-2 infected

76 individuals with known duration of infection and pre-pandemic samples were tested to

77 evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and to identify factors associated with a

78 false positive result.

80 METHODS

81 Ethics statement:

82

The use of samples from Baltimore was approved by The Johns Hopkins University

83 School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB00247886, IRB00250798, and IRB00091667).

84 The use of samples from Uganda was approved by the Uganda Virus Research Institute's

85 Research Ethics Committee (GC/127/20/04/773, GC/127/13/01/16), Western Institutional

86 Review Board, protocol 200313317 and the Uganda National Council for Science and

87 Technology (HS637ES). The parent studies were conducted according to the ethical standards of

88 the Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association, where all subjects provided written

89 informed consent. All samples were de-identified prior to testing.

90

91 Sample sets:

92

To assess sensitivity, samples from subjects known to be SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ from Uganda

93 and the United States with known duration from first PCR+ date were evaluated. Samples from

94 78 PCR+ individuals at different time intervals were identified at the Uganda Virus Research

95 Institute in Entebbe, and Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. None of the Ugandan

96 individuals were hospitalized and all had mild disease. Samples (n=266) from the United States

97 were from 38 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, attending the Johns Hopkins Hospital in

98 Baltimore, Maryland in the United States (13).

99

To assess the specificity of the assay, pre-pandemic samples were tested. This included

100 1077 stored samples from the Rakai Community Cohort Study, collected between 2011 and

101 2013 (14). The Ugandan samples included 543 individuals who reported having been febrile

102 within the month prior to sample acquisition and 534 individuals who did not report a febrile

103 illness, matched by age and gender. The 532 pre-pandemic samples from the US were remnant

104 CBC samples collected from Johns Hopkins Hospital Emergency Department (JHH ED) patients

105 collected between December 2015 and January 2016 (15).

106

107 Laboratory Testing and Statistical Analysis:

108

All samples were analyzed with the CoronaCHEK LFA (Hangzhou Biotest Biotech Co Ltd)

109 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sensitivity by duration of infection and specificity

110 among pre-pandemic samples were assessed for the presence of either IgM or IgG bands for

111 any reactivity. Statistical analysis was performed with STATA 14.2 (Statacorp College Station,

112 Texas, USA), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for sensitivity and specificity were

113 calculated with the Clopper-Pearson exact method. Bivariate Poisson regression models were

114 used to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) for factors associated with a false-positive test among

115 pre-pandemic samples.

116

117 RESULTS

118

There were significant differences in the performance for the CoronaCHEK LFA between

119 samples from Uganda and Baltimore (Table 1). When comparing any reactivity (IgM or IgG)

120 there was no significant difference in reactivity by duration of infection. Though 100% of

121 samples from Baltimore were seropositive by 14 days after their first time point, this was not

122 the case for the Ugandan samples. Specificity, when considering any reactive band as a false

123 positive result, was significantly lower in Ugandan samples at 96.9% (CI 95.2, 97.5) than in those

124 from Baltimore, 99.3% (CI 98.1, 99.8), p<0.01. When limited to Ugandan samples collected

125 from individuals with no reported febrile illness in the month prior to sample collection

126 (n=500), the specificity was still significantly lower 96.8% (CI 95.0,98.1) than in those samples

127 from Baltimore, p<0.05.

128

There were four and 38 false positive results in Baltimore pre-pandemic samples and

129 Ugandan samples, respectively. All four from Baltimore were all faint IgM bands while 82%

130 (31/38) of the false positive samples from Uganda had only reactive IgM bands. Of the seven

131 pre-pandemic Ugandan samples that were IgG reactive, two were also reactive for IgM.

132 Ugandan samples were significantly more likely to misclassify if they came from men (PR 2.04,

133 95% CI 1.03, 3.69, p=0.04) or the individual had reported fever more than a month prior to

134 sample collection (PR 2.87, 95% CI 1.12, 7.35, p=0.028). There was a trend to test positive if

135 they had reported pneumonia-like symptoms (PR 2.34, 95% CI 0.98, 5.59, p=0.056). Other

136 factors not associated with a false positive result included age, community type, and HIV status

137 (Table 2). There were too few misclassified samples from Baltimore to assess factors

138 associated with misclassification within this population.

139

140 DISCUSSION

141

This study demonstrates differential performance of the CoronaCHEK LFA on samples

142 collected from Uganda compared to those collected from Baltimore. Though sensitivity for both

143 IgG and IgM in samples from Baltimore was 100% by 14 days after the subjects first PCR+ date,

144 unlike samples from Uganda, this difference was not significantly different. Specificity was

145 significantly lower in the Ugandan pre-pandemic samples compared to those from Baltimore,

146 though this difference was all associated with the IgM band. False positive results in Ugandan

147 samples were higher among men and those who had reported a febrile episode more than a

148 month prior to sample acquisition. Of the false positive results detected, the vast majority

149 were IgM reactivity.

These results demonstrate that the performance characteristics of serological assays for

151 SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection cannot be extrapolated to different populations without

152 adequate validation studies. This study supports the need for validation studies on SARS-CoV-2

153 serologic assays in Africa, an area where little data exists (16). Though a lower specificity was

154 found in Ugandan samples than those from Baltimore, the specificity of 96.5% was much

155 greater than the 85% found for the Euroimmun IgG S1 ELISA in pre-pandemic samples from

156 Benin (8). As shown in the study by Mboumba Bouassa (7), our study demonstrated that the

157 main cause for false positive results was a reactive IgM test. If one ignores the presence of an

158 IgM band, the specificity of the CoronaCHEK increased to 99.4% (95% CI 98.7, 99.7) for Ugandan

159 samples and 100% (95% CI 99.3, 100) in Baltimore samples, with no loss of sensitivity at 14 days

160 post first positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2.

161

There are a number of limitations of our study. First, the samples from Uganda of SARS-

162 CoV-2 infected patients were limited, with only six samples within the first week post first PCR

163 positive test and no serial samples for a given individual. Additionally, these samples from

164 known infected Ugandan individuals had limited symptoms, while the Baltimore samples from

165 known SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals were all hospitalized subjects. The pre-pandemic

166 samples from Baltimore were not matched to those from Uganda based on symptomology,

167 though historically, individuals attending the ED in the United States have a high prevalence of

168 fever and viral infections (17). Samples from the JHH ED do have a high burden of chronic viral

169 infections, as demonstrated by a seroprevalence of 6%, 12% and 50% for HIV, HCV and HSV-2

170 respectively (18).

171

In summary, the geographical origin of the samples appeared to impact the

172 performance of the CoronaCHEK LFA. IgM reactivity was the main cause for the false positive

173 results. Given that IgM responses generally appear a couple days before IgG, it may be useful

174 not to measure IgM at all in serological studies given the improvement in specificity. Further

175 evaluations of serologic assays are needed to find appropriate tools for sero-surveillance in an

176 African setting.

6 Key Novel Findings 1. Comparison CLL vs MBL vs normal - 45% of CLL and 9.5% of MBL fail to seroconvert with 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine 2. Neutralization assay - SARS CoV-2 IgG levels <1000 AU/mL rarely associated with neutralization activity. 3. COVID-19-specific T-cell function by FluoroSpot IFN-g and IL-2 production 4. IgG, A, M class and IgG subclass: correlations by univariate and multivariate analysis - IgM (OR 7.29 p<0.0001), IgG2 and IgG3 subclass univariate significance 5. Correlation with therapy - ICT, targeted therapies, and those on Ig replacement 6. High risk of vaccination failure for all CLL, including early-stage disease, and MBL
Key Points CLL and MBL show significantly impaired anti-spike antibody, viral neutralization, with cellular immune response to COVID-19 vaccination Failure to seroconvert is associated with low IgM, IgG2, IgG3, and recent therapy; many CLL and MBL patients remain COVID-19 vulnerable

Abstract Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with immunocompromise and high risk of severe COVID-19 disease and mortality. Monoclonal B-Lymphocytosis (MBL) patients also have immune impairment. We evaluated humoral and cellular immune responses in 181 patients with CLL (160) and MBL (21) to correlate failed seroconversion (<50AU/mL SARSCoV-2 II IgG assay, antibody to spike protein, Abbott Diagnostics) following each of 2 vaccine doses with clinical and laboratory parameters. Following first and second doses, 79.2% then 45% of CLL, and 50% then 9.5% of MBL respectively remained seronegative, indicating 2 vaccine doses are crucial. There was significant association between post-dose 2 antibody level with pre-vaccination reduced IgM (p<0.0001), IgG2 (p<0.035), IgG3 (p<0.046), and CLL therapy within 12 months (p<0.001) in univariate analysis. By multivariate analysis, reduced IgM (p<0.0002) and active therapy (p<0.0002) retained significance. There was no significant correlation with age, gender, CLL duration, IgG, IgA or lymphocyte subsets. Anti-spike protein levels varied widely and were lower in CLL, than MBL, and both lower than normal donors. Neutralization activity showed anti-spike levels <1000AU/mL were usually negative for both an early viral clade and the contemporary Delta variant. There were 72.9% of CLL and 53.3% of MBL who failed to reach anti-spike levels >1000AU/mL. In a representative subset of 32 CLL patients, 80% had normal T-cell responses by IFN and IL-2 FluoroSpot assay. Failed seroconversion occurred in 36.6%% of treatment-naive patients, 52.9% treatment-naive with reduced IgM, 78.1% on therapy, and 85.7% on ibrutinib. Vaccination failure is very common in CLL, including early-stage disease.

Introduction
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is almost invariably associated with some degree of immune failure, that typically worsens over the course of the disease.1-3 About 85% of CLL patients ultimately develop hypogammaglobulinemia, but also a wide range of both humoral and cell-mediated immune defects.2,3 This predisposes to higher risk of infection4,5 and second malignancy.6-8 There is a higher frequency and severity of viral diseases such as herpes zoster,9,10 and for some, such as rhinovirus,11,12 there is impaired ability to clear the virus.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona-virus-type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single-stranded RNA virus that causes human infection, and COVID-19 disease manifestations, range from asymptomatic through to severe respiratory failure and death.13 COVID-19 has a major impact in patients with CLL.14,15 Data from the European Research Initiative on CLL (ERIC) show in CLL patients with confirmed COVID-19, 79% developed severe disease and require hospitalization and 36.4% died.16 Even in recent waves of the disease, mortality rates of 11% have been typical.17 Prolonged live virus shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has also been documented in CLL.18,19
Since the advent of COVID-19 vaccines, CLL patients have been included in national and global vaccination programs. Early data indicate that failure of seroconversion and probable ongoing COVID-19 susceptibility is a problem in CLL.20-22 For many, SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely resulting in major immediate risk of morbidity and mortality. We sought to better understand the immune impairments that predict failure of seroconversion by analyzing B and T-cell immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines and correlating with a wide range of

clinical, therapeutic, and biological characteristics including quantification of immunoglobulins (G, A, M, IgG subclasses), lymphocyte subsets, and COVID-19-specific neutralization antibody and T-cell responses.
Methods
The study was approved by the Northern Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number: LNR/14/HAWKE/181) and all patients provided an informed consent. The diagnosis of CLL and MBL were according to iwCLL guidelines.23 Vaccination occurred through the Australian Government vaccination program (www.health.gov.au) where the main initial vaccine availability was internationally and domestically produced Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca AZ), and more recently, Comirnaty (Pfizer) and Spikevax (Moderna) mRNA vaccines.24 Blood samples (FBC, biochemistry, immunoglobulins G, A, M, IgG subclasses, phenotyping and COVID-19 antibody levels) were taken pre-vaccination, then following vaccination doses 1 (D1) and 2 (D2) approximately 2 to 4 weeks following each dose. CLL therapy was avoided unless essential or given in the periods when there was no community COVID-19 transmission.25
IgG (6.5-16g/L), A (0.4-3.5g/L) and M (0.53-3g/L) were performed on the Siemens Atellica. IgG subclasses (IgG1, 3.82-9.29g/L; IgG2, 2.42-7g/L; IgG3, 0.22-1.76g/L; IgG4, 0.04-0.86g/L) were performed using Optilite IgG subclass kits (The Binding Site). Analysis of IgG and IgG subclass data excluded all patients on immunoglobin replacement therapy (IgRT). Flow

This chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay detects IgG antibodies to the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 antigen-coated paramagnetic microparticles bind to the IgG antibodies against the virus' spike protein in human serum and plasma samples. The resulting chemiluminescence in relative light units (RLU) following the addition of acridinium labeled anti-human IgG (mouse, monoclonal) in comparison with the IgG II calibrator/standard indicates the strength of response, which reflects the quantity of RBD IgG present. Fifty arbitrary units per milliliter (50AU/mL) and above in this test are considered positive. For this study, we also examined the degree of anti-spike protein response with arbitrary strata of <50 (negative), 50-249 (weak), 250-999 (moderate), 10004999 (strong), 5000-9999 (high), and >10000 (very high).
SARS-CoV-2 live virus neutralization assay:
HEK-ACE2/TMPRSS cells (Clone 24)26 were seeded in 384-well plates at 5×10^3 cells per well in the presence of the live cell nuclear stain Hoechst-33342 dye (NucBlue, Invitrogen) at a concentration of 5%v/v. Two-fold dilutions of patient plasma samples were mixed with an equal volume of SARS-CoV-2 virus solution (1.25×10^4 TCID50/mL) and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour before adding 40l in duplicate to the cells (final MOI = 0.05). Viral variants used included the variants of concern; Delta (B.1.617.2), as well as `wild-type' control virus (B.1.319/D614G strain) from an early circuiting 2020 clade (B.1). Plates were incubated for

24 hours post infection and entire wells were imaged by high-content fluorescence microscopy, cell counts obtained with automated image analysis software, and the percentage of virus neutralization was calculated with the formula: %N = (D-(1-Q)) × 100/D, as previously described.26 An average %N>50% was defined as having neutralizing activity. In studies of convalescent patients, 96% of COVID-19 infected, convalescent patients reach a titer of 1/40 at their peak and is therefore used as the benchmark titer in this study.26 The mean titer of the WHO G serology standard in this assay for the above B1 clade virus is 1/637.
IFNg/IL-2 Fluorospot Assay
PBMCs isolated from whole blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation were seeded in T-cell interferon gamma (IFN)/interleukin-2 (IL-2) dual color fluorospot plates (Mabtech). For patients with a CD3% within the normal reference interval, 250,000 cells per well were plated. For patients outside the reference interval, the cell number was normalized according to the patient's CD3%, derived by flow cytometry on whole blood, to give either 100,000 (for low CD3%) or 220,000 (for high CD3%) T cells in a maximum of 400,000 cells per well. Where a patient's CD3% was less than 20%, the maximum 400,000 cells per well was plated. Cells were incubated with an overlapping peptide pool spanning the complete S protein (2µg/mL; Miltenyi) for 18h at 37C. Negative control wells lacked peptides and PHA (10µg/mL; Vector Laboratories) was used as a positive control. Plates were developed according to the manufacturer's instructions and read on a Mabtech Iris fluorospot reader. All tests were performed in duplicate, and the mean value was used for data representation.

Statistical analyses
All analyses were conducted using SAS V9.4. The proportion of patients in various categories for response to COVID-19 vaccine and clinical variables are presented with exact 95% confidence limits. The association between COVID-19 vaccine response (negative/positive) after the second dose of vaccine and clinical variables was estimated using univariate logistic regression models, modelling the odds of a negative response, fitted with conditional exact methods to obtain exact P-values and 95% confidence limits. Exact methods were employed due to the small patient numbers in some categories. Multivariate logistic regression models, modelling the odds of a negative response after the second dose of vaccine, were fitted including multiple clinical variables found to be significant in univariate models. If two clinical variables were highly correlated (e.g. treatment within last 12 months and currently on treatment) only one variable was included. In addition, a final model was fitted including only terms statistically significant in the more inclusive multivariate model. Note, any analyses where pre-vaccination IgG levels (or IgG subclasses) were considered, patients currently treated with IgG replacement therapy were excluded.
Results Patient characteristics
From 1st March through to 22nd October 2021, a total of 235 patients, 206 CLL and 29 MBL, were assessed. Statistical analysis only included patients with post D2 vaccine response available, i.e., 160 CLL and 21 MBL, in total 181 patients. The patient baseline demographic

characteristics are shown in Table 1. The median age was 71.5 years for CLL, and 71 years for MBL. The proportion of males for CLL was 56.3%, and for MBL was 38.1%. The time from CLL diagnosis to vaccination ranged from <1 to 32 years with a median of 10 years.
There were 82 patients with CLL who were treatment-naïve, 40 previously treated in complete or partial remission, 6 with progressive disease pending therapy, and 32 on active therapy. Of the later there were 21 on ibrutinib, 2 on FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab), 1 bendamustine plus rituximab, 4 venetoclax (1 venetoclax/ibrutinib), and 4 on other therapies. The majority (both CLL and MBL) 149 received AZ while 23 received Pfizer, and 1 received Moderna for both D1 & D2, while for 8 patients, the type of vaccination was unclear. No difference in anti-spike antibody efficacy was identified with the different vaccines. No patients had COVID-19 infection prior to vaccination. There were no thromboembolic events cerebral or otherwise with the AZ vaccine, and no episodes of pericarditis or myocarditis reported with Pfizer.
Antibody responses
Antibody responses to COVID-19 spike protein (anti-S antibody) using the SARS-CoV-2 II IgG assay Abbott Diagnostics assay as qualitatively negative or positive (i.e. IgG level<50AU/mL or 50AU/mL) after D1 and D2 respectively are shown in Table 2. In CLL patients (n=160), 79.2% were negative after D1 and 45.0% remained negative after D2. For the 21 MBL patients, 40.0% and 9.5%, respectively were negative after each dose, compared to 0% and 0% of 25 normal controls (i.e. 100% of 25 normal controls seroconverted after D1) (Table 3 and Figure 1A). No patient or control had an anti-nucleocapsid antibody response prior to vaccination, consistent with absence of COVID-19 infection (data not shown).

Correlations with anti-S protein serologic response
Statistically significant associations were identified between failure to achieve an anti-S response with pre-vaccination low IgM (odds ratio [OR] 7.29, p<0.0001), low IgG2 (OR 2.52; p=0.035), low IgG3 (OR 2.68; p=0.046) and therapy within the prior 12 months (OR 5.20; p<0.0001) (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 1). We did not find statistically significant associations with age, sex, or duration of CLL. Neither IgA (OR 1.69) or total IgG (OR 1.84; p=0.16) reached statistical significance. All analysis of IgG and IgG subclasses excluded patients on IgRT. There was no correlation with the CLL or MBL clonal population level, nonclonal B-cell numbers, total CD3+, nor CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells, and nor with memory CD4+ or memory CD8+ T-cell populations (data not shown). There was no correlation with CLL cytogenetics or immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes (IGHV) mutational status.
Therapy in the prior 12 months was strongly associated with poor antibody response, with 74.4% failing to seroconvert (OR 5.20; p <0.0001) (Figure 2A and Supplementary Table 2). Some patients (n=6) with disease progression had their therapy deferred to minimize COVID-19 risk. For patients on active CLL-directed therapy, 78.1% remained seronegative after 2 vaccine doses (Supplementary Table 2). For those on active Btk-inhibition, mostly ibrutinib, 18 out of 21 failed to seroconvert (85.7%), and for those treated in the last 12 months, so did 7 of 9 receiving anti-CD20 (77.8%), 3 of 4 FCR, and 3 of 4 venetoclax. Interestingly, 2 of 2 patients on low dose prednisone (5mg daily) only for autoimmune cytopenia, and never on CLL-directed therapy had no seroconversion. Of CLL patients on IgRT for hypogammaglobulinemia with recurrent or severe infections, 77.3% (OR 5.18; p=0.002) failed to seroconvert (Figure 2A and Supplementary Table 2).

There were 82 (51.3%) treatment-naive patients 30 (36.6%) of whom failed to seroconvert. 52.9% of patients with reduced IgM as the only immunoglobulin class reduction failed to seroconvert.
Multivariate analysis of serologic response in patients with CLL
In a multivariate analysis, we evaluated parameters associated with failure to seroconvert, namely pre-vaccination IgG2 and IgG3 levels (not on IgRT), IgM levels and on-going treatment. Pre-vaccination IgM levels (OR 9.31; p=0.0002) and on-going therapy (OR 13.09; p=0.0002) remained predictors of negative serologic response. Pre-vaccination IgG2 (OR 1.19; p=0.69) and IgG3 (OR 2.11; p=0.13) lost significance in multivariate analysis.
Variation in anti-spike protein titers in CLL, MBL and normal
Anti-S levels in CLL demonstrated both a high proportion of negative results, and low levels compared to healthy controls (Figure 1). There was a wide range of anti-S levels from zero to >40,000. We divided these into six strata from negative to very high (Methods and Table 3) and measured neutralizing antibody in each stratum.
Neutralization assay and anti-spike antibody levels
Neutralizing capacity of 30 patients (5 patients from each stratum) measured against both the original D614G and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants are shown in Figure 3A and Supplementary Table 4. Of the 30 patients, neutralizing activity against the D614G strain was present in 12 (40%); 11 of those 12 had anti-S levels >1000, while 1 was 95AU/mL. Of the 30 patients, neutralizing activity against the Delta variant was seen in 9 (30%) and 8 had

Anti-S levels >1000, and 1 was 875AU/mL. Hence, the majority of patients with neutralizing antibody had an anti-S level of >1000. Only 3 of 18 patients with anti-S level <1000 had detectable neutralizing activity.
In view of the almost invariable absence of neutralizing activity with anti-S level <1000AU/mL, we evaluated the parameters associated with failure to achieve an anti-S level of >1000. The data are shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 3. After D2, 73.0% of CLL and 53.3% of MBL failed to reach an anti-S level >1000. Statistically significant associations between an anti-S level <1000, and IgM, IgG3 and treatment within the last 12 months remained, and IgA became statistically significant. The OR for total IgG was 2.75 (p=0.060), for IgM 2.81 (p=0.024), for IgA 3.30 (p=0.043), and for IgG3 3.84 (p=0.046). For patients on active therapy, 90% failed to achieve anti-S level >1000 (OR on therapy vs naïve/prior therapy 4.27, p=0.0659).
Cell-mediated and COVID-19 specific T cell response
COVID-19 specific IFN and IL-2 responses were measured in 31 patients by the FluoroSpot assay across a range of anti-S antibody and clinical settings, many from the cohort with neutralizing assay results (Figure 3B). Overall, COVID-19 peptide stimulated T-cells from freshly collected blood samples showed essentially normal function in most patients. There was no correlation with either anti-S antibody production, nor with neutralizing activity. Of the 31 patients, 25 (80%) had a normal response, albeit of variable intensity, while 6 (20%) had a weak or negative response. Good T-cell function was present in several patients with prior and current therapy. There was no clear correlation between T-cell function and any clinical or therapeutic parameter.

Discussion
CLL patients are virtually all immunocompromised to some extent1,2 and while SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have proven successful in protecting the general community, early data suggest that many patients with CLL fail vaccination20-22. In this study we examined patients across the spectrum of CLL, from those with a small peripheral blood clone, MBL27,28, to early stage CLL through to advanced stage and heavily treated CLL. Patients who fail to mount an antibody response likely remain COVID-19 susceptible and vulnerable to severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death.15 We therefore focused on this vulnerable group who failed to seroconvert examining both the humoral and cell-mediated immune response.
The study demonstrates a high proportion of CLL patients fail to achieve a positive anti-S level greater than the assay threshold of 50AU/mL, with 79.2% and 45% failing seroconversion after D1 and D2, respectively (Table 2). In MBL, 50% and 9.5% remained seronegative after D1 and D2. By contrast, a group of normal controls all achieved a positive anti-S level after D1, with much higher levels after D2. This emphasizes the importance of 2 vaccine doses in patients with CLL, and MBL. All patients with MBL by definition, and a high proportion of early stage CLL have few or no clinical problems with their disease, and many have minimal if any infection risk prior to COVID-19. Many of these patients do not mount a COVID-19 vaccine antibody response. In view of the indolent nature of their CLL, COVID-19 is now likely their highest risk of morbidity and mortality, far exceeding that from the CLL (or MBL) itself.

Parameters associated with failure to achieve a positive anti-S level in univariate analysis were pre-vaccination reduced IgM, IgG2, IgG3, and CLL therapy within 12 months (p <0.0001, 0.035, 0.046 and <0.001 respectively). There was no significant correlation with age, gender, CLL duration, IgG, IgA or lymphocyte subsets. Patients aged 65 years and older had a potentially meaningful higher risk of vaccine failure with an OR of 1.34, overall similar to data reported by Parry et al.20 and Herishanu et al.21.
Evaluating total IgG only in patients not on IgRT, the OR for pre-vaccination IgG was 1.84 but did not reach significance (p=0.17). There was a novel correlation with IgG2 and IgG3 and failure to seroconvert, but not IgG1, raising the interesting hypothesis that IgG2 and IgG3 may be more important than IgG1 for COVID-19 vaccine response.29 Furthermore, the lack of difference with response and IgG1 may contribute to why total IgG did not reach significance. Unlike 2 other studies20,21, we did not find significance with IgA, but this did emerge as significant when considering anti-S level >1000AU/mL as a strong serologic response.
Clinical variables significant in univariate analyses were considered in a multivariate model. Reduced IgM, prior treatment in the last 12 months, currently on treatment, current/prior IgG replacement therapy, reduced IgG2 and reduced IgG3 were all statistically significant at the p<0.05 level by univariate analysis. Due to the high correlation between any treatment in the last 12 months and currently on treatment, only "currently on treatment" was included in the model and enabled direct comparison with Israeli data21. Consistent with Herishanu et al.21, currently on treatment (OR 13.09; p=0.0002) and IgM (OR 9.31; p=0.0002), but not IgA, were predictors of serologic responses to vaccines. We did not find association between total IgG and vaccine responses. The OR for pre-vaccination IgG3 was

2.11 did not reach significance (p=0.13). Low IgG2 and low IgM were highly correlated as 45% of CLL patients had both (Supplementary data Table 5).
The strong association of failure to respond to vaccination with a low IgM level, often as a sole immunoglobulin class abnormality, is of concern as this is present in over a half of all CLL patients at diagnosis and in early-stage disease.2 This highlights the large numbers of CLL patients at ongoing risk, but also the importance of IgM and the primary immune response in developing antibodies.
Regarding CLL patients on therapy, as also demonstrated by others, there was a very strong association with vaccination failure in 74.4% (OR 5.20, p<0.001) of patients treated within the last 12 months, and 78% of those currently on active therapy failing to respond. Indeed, we found markedly impaired vaccine response with all forms of therapy with 18/21 ibrutinib,30 7/9 CD20 antibody,31 3/4 FCR and 3/4 venetoclax all failing to seroconvert.
Patients requiring IgRT as expected had very low vaccine response with 77.3% (OR 5.18; p=0.002) failing to develop antibodies. In Australia, the criteria for IgRT access for CLL patients are the presence of both hypogammaglobulinemia, and "recurrent or severe infection". Hence this group is a surrogate for the "history of severe infection" group reported by Parry et al.20 and with a highly comparable response and failure rate.
Anti-S levels varied widely with many low, and of note lower in CLL, than in MBL, and in turn both were lower than healthy donors. Neutralization assays performed across the wide range of anti-S levels showed that neutralization activity was almost entirely restricted to those with an anti-S level >1000AU/mL. Using 1000AU/mL as the threshold of response,

73.0% of CLL and 53.3% of MBL failed to achieve this level. Also of note was that viral neutralization titers appeared weaker for the now globally dominant Delta variant compared to the original D614G strain. This is not unexpected as the vaccines were designed for D614G, but it is reassuring that significant activity against the Delta variant was demonstrated. T-cell responses appeared relatively intact, including those having received prior FCR and those on active therapy.32 Some patients appeared to have adequate T-cell numbers but failed to respond. Similarly, we found no significant correlation with total CD3+, nor CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells, and nor with memory CD4+ or memory CD8+ T-cell populations (data not shown).
Using an anti-S level >1000AU/mL as the threshold, parameters associated with negative response remain reduced pre-vaccination IgM, IgG3, and CLL therapy within 12 months (p<0.024, 0.046, and 0.041 respectively), but not for IgG2 (p=0.98). Interestingly and conversely, the association between reduced pre-vaccination IgA and failure to respond (OR 3.30, p=0.043) becomes statistically significant, and hence coincides with data reported by Parry et al.20 and Herishanu et al.21. Both those two reports employed the Roche Elecsys® electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for measuring serologic responses while we used the Abbott Diagnostics assay. Differences in assay performance33,34 may contribute to discrepancies between our data and those of Parry et al.20 and Herishanu et al.21.
CLL and immunocompromised individuals are unable to clear certain viruses such as rhinovirus.11,12 For the much more serious COVID-19, long-term shedding of live virus has now been documented in CLL.19,35 The failure to develop anti-S antibodies or neutralizing activity is likely a major contributing factor to develop long-term viral replication and shedding.35 While the incidence of this issue remains unclear, its occurrence has major

implications for CLL patients, their families, friends, and the broader community for infection control.
Some CLL patients do respond to vaccination as a recent second report from the Israeli group36 demonstrates, and this remains intact for at least 6 months. However, among CLL patients who fail to respond to 2 dose vaccinations, the response rates to third or more doses are likely to be low, and with low levels of anti-S,37 and this is consistent with our experience to date. Nevertheless, third and perhaps fourth vaccine doses are the easiest and most immediately available option and supported by our T-cell FluoroSpot data suggesting a functional T-cell anti-COVID-19 response in most patients. These T cell responses, especially CD8+ T cells, may be important in protection against severe lung disease, and T and B cell memory are important in durability of the vaccine response, probably especially in the ageing.38,39 Nevertheless, it is clear that there will be a significant group for whom no amount of vaccination will result in seroconversion.
For patients who fail to seroconvert, the ongoing management is likely to remain a challenge for some time and will almost certainly rely on passive immunity. In some settings, hyperimmune COVID-19 immunoglobulin40 is available but supply is likely to remain limited. Immunoglobulin replacement therapies may soon have anti-S antibodies detectable, however, the level of antibody and whether it confers any protective activity will be difficult to establish. Furthermore, the antibody levels will reflect vaccination rates in source plasma which is known to be low even in some settings with unrestricted vaccine access. Monoclonal antibody (MAb) preparations recently developed such as sotrovimab41 and the antibody combination (REGEN-COV casirivimab and imdevimab)42 are currently used in the setting of COVID-19 infection rather than prophylaxis due to the relatively short

half-life (eg casirivimab and imdevimab, 32 and 27 days, respectively) of these MAb. The very recent data on the high-neutralization MAb cocktail, AZD7442 (co-administered tixagevimab and cilgavimab)43 engineered for a prolonged half-life of 9-12 months will make this and similar agents more practical as a prophylactic therapy for those patients who are unable to achieve protective antibodies by vaccination.
In conclusion, the rate of vaccination failure is very high in CLL, especially those on therapy, but also includes many with early-stage disease, and also individuals with MBL, i.e. patients for whom disease-related immune impairment previously had minimal clinical impact. Our data show there is a significant gap between seroconversion with anti-S antibody positivity and the presence of neutralizing antibodies, the latter of which are present in a much smaller proportion of MBL and CLL. It will be important to establish which elements of the immune system best predict Covid-19 protection as many appear to have an intact T-cell response. In any event, the standard precaution measures of masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, and vaccination of close family, friends and contacts will remain important and every CLL patient should remain conscious of these relatively simple precautions. The data from third and more vaccine doses will be important to evaluate as the information becomes available, as will the evaluation of MAbs and other potential passive immune strategies.

Abstract Objectives: To compare risk factors for COVID-19 mortality among hospitalized Hispanic, Non-
Hispanic Black, and White patients.
Design: Retrospecitve cohort study Setting: Five hosptials within a single academic health system Participants: 3,086 adult patients with self-reported race/ethnicity information presenting to
the emergency department and hospitalized with COVID-19 up to April 13, 2020.
Main outcome measures: In-hospital mortality Results: While older age (multivariable OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.05-1.07) and baseline hypoxia
(multivariable OR 2.71, 95% CI 2.17-3.36) were associated with increased mortality overall and across all races/ethnicities, Non-Hispanic Black (median age 67, IQR 58-76) and Hispanic (median age 63, IQR 50-74) patients were younger and had different comorbidity profiles compared to Non-Hispanic White patients (median age 73, IQR 62-84; p<0.05 for both comparisons). Among inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19 mortality, there was a significant interaction between the Non-Hispanic Black population and interleukin-1-beta (interaction p-value 0.04).
Conclusions: This analysis of a multi-ethnic cohort highlights the need for inclusion and
consideration of diverse popualtions in ongoing COVID-19 trials targeting inflammatory cytokines.

Introduction
Reports from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Brazil have highlighted racial disparities in the COVID-19 pandemic.1-4 National studies from the UK and Brazil have found race to be an independent predictor of death.3,4 In the United States, Black and Hispanic individuals have disproportionately high rates of infection, hospitalization, and mortality.1,2,5,6 These disparities have been attributed to greater representation of Black and Hispanic persons in essential services, and a higher burden of comorbidities in minority communities, among others.
While Black and Hispanic individuals in the US have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, the majority of published studies investigating COVID-19 mortality risk factors have been in cohorts of individuals with predominantly European or Asian ancestry.7-11 Few US studies have directly examined mortality risk factors and their effect sizes in Black or Hispanic compared to White individuals.1,12 Rigorous analysis to establish risk factors and molecular predictors for each population is urgently needed.
We sought to identify race/ethnic-specific clinical and immune factors of mortality using a diverse cohort of White, Black, and Hispanic COVID-19 patients admitted to a single health system in New York. In addition to baseline characterization, we conducted stratified and interaction term analyses to identify risk and immune factors that may affect outcomes of each patient population. The systematic analyses revealed population-specific effects of multiple risk factors that were previously unknown, highlighting the importance of including diverse patient populations and tailored consideration in precision medicine for COVID-19.

Results
Study population
There were 4,997 adult patients with COVID-19-related emergency department (ED) visits on or before April 13th, 2020, of whom 3,086 (61.8%) were hospitalized. Hospitalization rates were significantly lower for Non-Hispanic (NH) Black patients compared to other groups (NH Black 56.5%; NH White 63.4%; Hispanic 64.3%, Asian 62.6%; Other 63.6%; p<0.001). Hospitalized patients were significantly older (median age 66 vs. 50, p<0.001) and were more likely to have comorbidities such as hypertension (35.5% vs. 13.5%, p<0.001), diabetes (24% vs. 7.8%,
p<0.001), and chronic kidney disease (11.9% vs. 3.1%, p<0.001) (Supplemental Table 1). The
clinical characteristics of non-hospitalized patients are summarized by race/ethnicity in
Supplemental Table 2.
The hospitalized cohort included 3,086 adult patients. We excluded 78 patients with missing race or ethnicity data, 144 Asian patients, and 458 patients with other or unspecified
race/ethnicity from the comparative/stratified analyses based on power considerations (Figure 1). The remaining 2,406 patients were 37.1% Hispanic, 34.3% Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, and
28.6% NH White.
Compared to NH White patients, NH Black and Hispanic patients were younger (median age 67
and 63 vs. 73, p<0.001 for both) (Table 1). NH Black patients were more likely to have
hypertension (40.6% vs 31.8%, p<0.001), diabetes (26.8% vs. 17.4%, p<0.001), and chronic kidney disease (16.1% vs. 8%, p<0.001) than NH White patients. Hispanic patients were more likely to have diabetes (27.4% vs. 17.4%, p<0.001), chronic kidney disease (13% vs. 8%,

These results demonstrate differences in the distributions demographic and clincial COVID-19 mortality risk factors by race/ethnicity.
Population-specific clinical factors associated with death
Unadjusted mortality rates were lower among NH Black (27.5% vs. 34.1%, p=0.006) and Hispanic (23.9% vs. 34.1%, p<0.001) patients compared to NH White patients. Rates of intensive care were not significantly different between NH Black and NH White (19.8% vs 21.5%, p=0.44) or Hispanic and NH White (23.4% vs 21.5%, p=0.36) patients.
We first evaluated the association of demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables with in-
hospital mortality (Table 2, Supplemental Table 4 & 5). In a univariate analysis, NH Black (OR
0.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.91) and Hispanic (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.49-0.76) populations were associated with lower mortality compared to NH White. However, race/ethnicity was not an independent predictor of mortality after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and baseline hypoxia (oxygen saturation <92% at the first measurement of the clinical encounter) in this cohort (Black HR
1.03, 95% CI 0.80-1.32; Hispanic HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73-1.21) (Figure 2A). Our finding is
consistent with several cohort studies in the US,1,13,14 although UK and Brazil studies have reported race as an independent predictor of mortality,3,4 possibly due to population differences.

Previous patient cohort analyses rarely considered race/ethnic-specific risk factors, which require stratified modeling within each population cohort. We conducted stratified analyses within ethnic groups to determine the population-specific effect sizes of clinical factors and comorbidity. Diabetes was associated with an odds ratio of 1.67 (95% CI 1.09-2.58) in the stratified NH Black population, and an odds ratio of 0.99 (95% CI 0.61-1.63) in the NH White
population (Figure 2B). Obesity was associated with an odds ratio of 1.33 (95% CI 0.69-2.58) in NH Black, compared to an odds ratio of 0.72 (95% CI 0.33-1.60) in NH White (Figure 2B).

Increased age and baseline hypoxia were consistently associated with increased mortality
across all three populations (Supplemental Table 6). Altogether, these results highlight the
shared and specific clinical risk factors of COVID-19 mortality across populations.

Baseline laboratory values

We analyzed baseline lab values among patients admitted to the largest site in our dataset, the Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH). This site had the most complete records for routine and inflammatory lab values. We defined baseline labs as the first lab value within 24 hours of the start of the encounter.

Among common lab values, Hispanic patients had higher baseline alanine aminotransferase
values (ALT, 33 vs. 28 U/L, p=0.03) than NH White patients (Table 3), consistent with the
increased prevalence of chronic liver disease among Hispanic patients.

Among inflammatory lab markers, NH Black patients had higher initial levels of procalcitonin (0.29 vs. 0.13 ng/mL, p<0.001), and more abnormal ferritin levels (3.16 vs. 2.24 times upper
limit of normal, p=0.03) compared to NH White patients (Table 3). There were no significant
differences in baseline d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1-beta (IL-1B), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), or tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNFa) levels. Thus, population-specific associations identified for these immune factors would indicate contributions from their relative differences between patients of different outcomes within a population rather than baseline differences across populations.

We next conducted a multi-ethnic analysis to identify immune markers associated with patient outcomes in the MSH cohort. Using multivariate models adjusting for age, sex, and hypoxia, we identified CRP (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.16-1.68), albumin (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.91), IL-6 (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12-1.82), WBC (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.65), and LDH (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.07-1.68) as
independent predictors of mortality (Supplemental Table 7).
To identify immune markers showing population-specificity in predicting COVID-19 outcomes, we applied the multivariate regression model in each population-stratified cohort. Elevated levels of IL-1B were associated with a higher risk of mortality in Black (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.13-
4.86) compared to White patients (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.41-1.51) (Figure 3, Supplemental Table 7).
Increased procalcitonin levels were associated with an odds ratio of 2.65 (95% CI 0.88-7.96) in Hispanic patients, compared to an odds ratio of 0.98 (95% CI 0.58-1.66) among NH White patients. Increased IL-8 levels were associated with an odds ratio of 1.51 (95% CI 0.59-3.86) among Hispanic patients, and an odds ratio of 8.76 (95% CI 0.95-80.7) among White patients
(Supplemental Table 7). To validate the population-specificity of these COVID-19 mortality-
associated immune markers, we further utilized a multivariate model including interaction terms, finding a significant interaction between NH Black and IL-1B (p=0.04) and a suggestive but non-significant interactions between Hispanic and procalcitonin (p=0.07) and IL-8 (p=0.09)
compared to NH White (Supplemental Table 6).
Next, we sought to validate the immune marker findings of the MSH cohort in an independent dataset. We utilized immunoprofiling data from the University of Pennsylvania cohort15 to compare levels of serum cytokines and immunologic markers between diverse patient

populations vs. heatlhy and recovered donors. Among the COVID-19 patients with available race/ethnicity data, eight were NH Black, three were NH White, and four were Asian. Additionally, there were ten healthy donors (HDs) and twelve recovered donors (RDs) with no available race/ethnicity data.
We used the non-parametric Mood's median test to detect potential population differences in the median values of 13 measured immune markers against the combined cohort of HDs and
RDs (HDs/RDs, Supplemental Table 8). NH Black patients had significantly higher median IL-6
(37.1 vs 2.59, p=0.003) and IP10 (227 vs 55.6, p=0.006), and lower median IL12p70 (1.98 vs 3.41, p=0.004) levels than HDs/RDs. IP10 was also found to be significant when comparing NH White or Asian patients vs. HDs/RDs (p<0.05). Median IL-1B was 4.13 in NH Black patients compared to 2.66 in HDs/RDs (p=0.115), providing a suggestive yet non-significant association to the finding in the MSH cohort.
Discussion
Racial disparities in COVID-19 infections and outcomes have become apparent in both the US and elsewhere.1-4 The causes of these disparities are complex and multifactorial and must be considered in the context of the social determinants of health.4,16
In this study, set in New York City during the height of the initial COVID-19 surge, we describe the characteristics and outcomes of a diverse cohort including substaintial numbers of NH White, NH Black, and Hispanic patients. The three groups differed significantly in demographic and clinical factors. White patients were older and showed higher rates of cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease atrial fibrillation. NH Black and Hispanic patients were

younger, and had different comorbidity profiles, e.g. hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and chronic liver disease.
Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was highest in NH White patients, but multivariable analysis showed that race/ethnicity was not an independent predictor of mortality in this cohort. It remains unclear whether race and ethnicity are independent risk factors for COVID-19 mortality after adjusting for confounding factors. Large national-level studies in the UK and Brazil have reported race as an independent predictor of mortality,3,4 whereas smaller studies in the US have not,1,13,14 possibly due to statistical power or population differences. Changes in clinical management and outcomes of COVID-19 over the course of the pandemic may also complicate comparisons of results from different time periods.17 In this New York City patient population, race/ethnicity was not an independent predictor for mortality.
In addition to describing this cohort, we aimed to test established COVID-19 risk factors for race/ethnicity-specific effects. Despite recapitulating several known risk factors, such as age, male sex, and hypoxia, we found only suggestive but non-significant interactions between Black race, diabetes and obesity, both of which tended to increase the mortality risk of Black patients to a greater degree than White patients. Notably, when analyzing inflammatory markers for their association with mortality, we found a significant interaction between the NH Black population and the inflammatory cytokine IL-1B.
Excessive inflammation has emerged as an important aspect of COVID-19 pathophysiology, and the anti-inflammatory steroid dexamethasone has been shown to improve outcomes among those with severe disease.18 The interaction between the NH Black population and IL-1B raises

the possibility that differences in immunity may contribute to worse outcomes in some patients. Black Americans are at higher risk of autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis compared to White Americans, differences which can be linked in some cases to specific polymorphisms which are more common in African Americans.19-22
Interleukin-1-beta (IL-1B) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a role in both physiologic and pathologic inflammation. IL-1 inhibitors such as anakinra and canakinumab have been developed to target IL-1 in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Still's disease. These agents are also being actively investigated as COVID-19 treatments. Thus far, two randomized studies have found no clinical benefit from IL-1 inhibitors in COVID-19.23,24 However, these studies have not reported analyses taking race/ethnicity into account.
The strengths of our database include its size and the inclusion of 37.1% Hispanic patients, a vulnerable population in this pandemic which, has been underrepresented in the literature to date. Additionally, our near-complete follow-up of the cohort's hospital outcomes (99.3%) strengthens the validity of our findings.
In conclusion, our analysis of a diverse cohort drawn from the New York metropolitan area highlights both similarities and important differences across racial/ethnic groups in risk factors for death among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The findings identified across populations call for conscious inclusion in future cohort studies and clinical trials to ensure the efficacy of potential diagnostics and treatments across diverse individuals.

Limitations of the study
Our study has limitations that warrant specific mention. The cytokine analysis was limited to only a subset of the population and should be considered exploratory. We were not able to control for other comorbidities which may have influenced cytokine levels (e.g. diabetes and IL1B).25 The dataset was derived from the electronic health record database without manual review, which may limit the completeness of comorbidity labels. Race and ethnicity were selfreported and were missing or unspecified in 17.4% of the initial cohort. The subset of patients with cytokine data was limited in number and models testing interactions Causal mechanisms underlying the correlations identified in this retrospective analysis remain to be elucidated.
Methods
Study setting
The study was conducted within the Mount Sinai Health System, which is an academic healthcare system comprising 8 hospitals and more than 410 ambulatory practice locations in the New York metropolitan area. This analysis involves patients who presented to five hospitals: The Mount Sinai Hospital (1,134 beds), Mount Sinai West (514 beds), and Mount Sinai Morningside (495 beds) in Manhattan; Mount Sinai Brooklyn (212 beds); and Mount Sinai Queens (235 beds).
Data sources
Data were captured by the Epic electronic health record (Epic Systems, Verona, WI), and directly extracted from Epic's Clarity and Caboodle servers. This de-identified dataset was

developed and released by the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse (MSDW) team, with the goal of encompassing all COVID-19 related patient encounters within the Mount Sinai system, accompanied by selected demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, medications, and lab values. As part of de-identification, all patients over the age of 89 had their age set to 90.
This study utilized de-identified data extracted from the electronic health record and as such was considered non-human subject research. Therefore, this study was granted an exemption from the Mount Sinai IRB review and approval process.
Patient population and definitions
The MSDW dataset captured any patient encounters at a Mount Sinai facility with any of the following: a COVID-19 related encounter diagnosis, a COVID-19 related visit type, a SARS-CoV-2 lab order, a SARS-CoV-2 lab result, or a SARS-CoV-2 lab test result from the New York State Department of Health's Wadsworth laboratory. For this study, we identified patients with COVID-19 related visits to to the emergency department on or before April 13th, 2020 and selected patients who were admitted. We followed their hospitalization outcomes through June 2nd, 2020.
Our analysis was limited to adults over 18 years old who were hospitalized for COVID-19 through a Mount Sinai emergency department. Self-reported race and ethnicity were classified into 3 mutually exclusive categories: Non-Hispanic White (White), Non-Hispanic Black (Black),
and Hispanic (Supplemental Table 1). COVID-19 positivity was determined by a positive or
presumptive positive result from a nucleic acid-based test for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens. Baseline vital signs were the first documented vital signs for

the encounter. Hypoxia was defined as an oxygen saturation less than 92%. We defined baseline labs as the first lab value within 24 hours of the start of the encounter.
University of Pennsylvania cohort:
Patients in the University of Pennsylvania cohort were identified based on a postive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Patients were screened and consented within 72 hours of hospitalization. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records into standardized case reports. Healthy donors had no prior diagnosis or symptoms consident with COVID-19. Recovered donors were adults with a self reported positive COVID-19 PCR test who recovered as defined by the Centers for Disease Control. Cyotkine levels were measured from peripheral blood plasma using a custom human cytokine 31-plex panel (EMD Millipore Corporation, SPRCUS707), as described in Divij et al.15
Logistic regression
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with death. Race/ethnicity-specific risk factors were identified by 1) constructing stratified models for each racial category, and 2) constructing models including interaction terms between race/ethnicity and other covariates. Separate interaction models were created to test the interactions of either Hispanic ethnicity or Black race with other covariates. Interactions were compared against White race as the reference group.

We analyzed demographic factors, comorbidities, initial vital signs, baseline lab values, and treatment facility site (Manhattan vs. Brooklyn/Queens) as covariates. There was minimal clustering of outcomes by treatment site (ICC () = 0.026), and this was modeled as a fixed effect. Covariates were chosen a priori based on prior reports. We report the odds ratios derived from the coefficients of each model, along with the Wald-type confidence interval, and p-values.
Laboratory value analysis
Markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and d-dimer, have been proposed as being correlated with COVID-19 severity. However, the missingness of these lab values varied across sites. Given the possibility of confounding by indication (if providers ordered these labs in more acutely ill patients), we limited the analyses involving lab tests to those obtained at the largest site (The Mount Sinai Hospital) and which had less than 15% missing values at that site. The cytokines interleukin-1-beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were exempted from this threshold because they were obtained on a subset of COVID-19 patients in the context of a study with broad inclusion criteria.26,27
To test the associations of these lab values with mortality, we tested each lab test in race/ethnicity-stratified multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, and hypoxia. The number of covariates in the model was limited due to the reduced sample size. Labs were standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 prior to regression analysis.

Patient characteristics and baseline vitals and labs were described using medians and ranges for continuous variables, and proportions for categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test. All statistical analyses and data visualizations were carried out using R 4.0.0 (The R foundation, Vienna, Austria), along with the tidyverse, ggpubr, forestplot, and Hmisc packages. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.

ABSTRACT
Patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) can experience life-threatening respiratory distress, blood pressure dysregulation and thrombosis. This is thought to be associated with an impaired activity of angiotensinconverting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which is the main entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and which also tightly regulates blood pressure by converting the vasoconstrictive peptide angiotensin II (AngII) to a vasopressor peptide. Here, we show that a significant proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed autoantibodies against AngII, whose presence correlates with lower blood oxygenation, blood pressure dysregulation, and overall higher disease severity. Anti-AngII antibodies can develop upon specific immune reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins Spike or RBD, to which they can crossbind, suggesting some epitope mimicry between AngII and Spike/RBD. These results provide important insights on how an immune reaction against SARS-CoV-2 can impair blood pressure regulation.

INTRODUCTION Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative
virus of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), infects cells by binding to angiotensinconverting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its Spike protein. ACE-2 is an enzyme expressed on the surfaces of alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells (1), among others, that plays an important role in regulating blood pressure by converting the vasoconstrictive peptide angiotensin II (AngII) to the vasopressor peptide angiotensin-(1-7) (2, 3). It is known that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to dysregulation of vascular tension, endothelial inflammation and enhanced thrombosis, presumably through enhancing endocytosis of ACE-2 and thereby lowering its cell-surface presence (4, 5).
Here, we sought to explore whether SARS-CoV-2 infection might induce autoantibodies against the peptide AngII. We hypothesized that the simultaneous binding of SARS-CoV-2 and AngII to ACE-2 might lead to their co-phagocytosis by antigenpresenting cells, thus providing a strong immune adjuvant (the virus molecules) to the self-peptide AngII, leading to an anti-AngII autoimmune response (6, 7). Moreover, we asked whether some epitope mimicry might exist between a domain on the Spike protein and AngII, based on their shared binding to ACE-2. Importantly, the induction of antiAngII antibodies in COVID-19 patients, if it occurs, could interfere with AngII processing by ACE2 and signaling to its receptors, potentially contributing to the dysregulation of vascular tension and worsening acute respiratory distress syndrome(8, 9).
We conducted observational studies using serum of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and determined that such autoantibodies are indeed induced, independently of anti-RBD levels. Instead, their presence and levels were strongly correlated with blood pressure dysregulation and poor oxygenation. We finally demonstrated cross-reactivity of some antibodies between AngII and the Spike protein, suggesting immune epitope homology between these molecules.

RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION We began by assessing the presence of IgG antibodies against AngII in the
plasma of 221 subjects, among which 115 were hospitalized COVID-19 patients convalescent from a SARS-CoV-2 infection, 58 were control donors (i.e. non-SARSCoV-2 infected and non-hypertensive), and 48 were hypertensive non-SARS-CoV-2 infected donors. Surprisingly, we found that a substantial proportion, 63% (73/115), of the COVID-19 patients had positive levels of anti-AngII autoantibodies, as determined by an ELISA absorbance greater than 3 standard deviations above the mean of the control donor group (Fig. 1A). Of these, 53% (39/73) had high levels, defined as greater than twice the positive threshold. In contrast, only one control donor (1.7%) was antiAngII positive, with a level just above the positive limit. Patient age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) were not significantly correlated with anti-AngII positivity (Fig S1A-D), although older patients trended towards increased levels of anti-AngII (p=0.064 by Spearman correlation, Fig. S1A). Additional trends suggested that female COVID-19 patients were more likely to develop high anti-AngII levels (42% vs. 25% of males, Fig. S1B) as well as patients with BMI  25 (38% vs. 20% of patients with normal BMI, Fig. S1C, D).
Since a majority of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients in this cohort had preexisting hypertension (COVID HTN, 64%), we measured anti-AngII levels in plasma from hypertensive donors taken prior to the pandemic (non-COVID HTN) to determine whether autoantibodies against AngII could have been pre-existing in HTN patients. Interestingly, we detected anti-AngII antibodies in 15% of these hypertensive donors (Fig. 1A, B), which was far less than in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, when comparing the HTN vs. non-HTN COVID-19 patients, the levels of anti-AngII were similar (Fig. 1C) as well as the percentages with positive levels (65% and 60%, respectively; Fig. 1D). These results indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 promotes the development of anti-AngII IgG antibodies in a majority of patients that developed severe

disease (i.e., required hospitalization), regardless of whether they had pre-existing hypertension.
Next, we asked whether the presence and levels of anti-AngII antibodies correlated with those of antibodies directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the virus' Spike protein. As expected, most patients (76%) developed positive levels of anti-RBD antibodies, here considered above a total IgG titer of 3 based on healthy control levels (Fig. S2A). However, correlations between anti-RBD levels and anti-AngII levels were only modest; in fact, a majority of anti-AngII(-) patients developed antibodies against RBD (Fig. 1E), and patients with high anti-RBD titers did not necessarily develop anti-AngII antibodies (34% remained anti-AngII(-)) (Fig. 1F). In addition, although patients positive for one antibody were more likely to be positive for the other, this effect was not statistically significant (p=0.056 and p=0.087 using 2 tests comparing the proportion of anti-AngII(+) patients across the anti-RBD (-/Lo/Hi) groups, and viceversa). Similar results were observed when considering the average antibody levels instead of proportions of positive patients. Despite a slight increase in anti-AngII levels along with anti-RBD levels (Fig.S2B, S2C), no significant correlation was observed between them when analyzing the plasma of patients collected after 7 days postsymptom onset (DPSO), which is the approximate time needed to observe a new IgG response in blood upon primary infection (Fig. 1G, p=0.29 by Spearman test).

(G) Correlation between antiAngII levels and anti-RBD titers in COVID patients. Patients for which the plasma was analyzed at or after 7 days post-symptoms (DPSO) are indicated in black, whereas those analyzed before 7 DPSO are in grey (Spearman correlation on datapoints  7 DPSO). (H) Co-variations of antiAngII and anti-RBD levels between 1-10 DPSO (tail of the arrow) and 11-20 DPSO (tip of the arrow) matched per patient (arrow, N=25).
We then questioned when anti-AngII antibodies developed relative to anti-RBD antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing their levels between early vs. later times (1-10 vs. 11-20 DPSO) in the 25 anti-AngII(+) patients for which these timepoints were available. From early to late, some patients showed increases in both anti-RBD and anti-AngII (Fig. 1H in red, 15/25), while others showed increases in anti-RBD accompanied by decreases in anti-AngII (Fig. 1H in blue, 10/25). Between these times, the increase in anti-RBD levels reached statistical significance (Fig. S2D), as expected, whereas the increase in anti-AngII levels did not (Fig. S2E, p=0.18 by Wilcoxon matched pairs sign rank test). Moreover, anti-AngII antibodies were still detected in 11 patients at >45 DPSO (Fig. S2F), suggesting that either anti-AngII antibodies are long-lasting, or that they are maintained over a long-lasting symptomatic period in these patients. Together, these data suggest that antibodies levels generated against AngII are not necessarily correlated with those against RBD.
We next studied the development of anti-AngII IgG in mice upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (note that murine and human AngII are 100% homologous). We vaccinated mice at 0 and 21 days with 10 g Spike or RBD, admixed with either (i) the

None of the naïve mice (0/25) had detectable anti-AngII IgG (Fig. 2A). In contrast, 24% (6/25) of the mice vaccinated with RBD + MPLA/Alum and 27% (4/15) of mice vaccinated with Spike + MPLA/Alum developed antibodies against AngII. Interestingly, none of the mice vaccinated with Spike + AddaS03 (0/9) or with RBD + CpG (0/10) developed anti-AngII antibodies, as well as none of the mice vaccinated with unadjuvanted RBD or Spike (0/10 each), or with MPLA/Alum lacking antigen (0/20).
We further analyzed the time course of the immune responses in mice, measuring anti-AngII levels at weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 for the mice vaccinated with RBD + MPLA/alum or Spike + MPLA/Alum that were positive for anti-AngII. This analysis highlighted an increase in anti-AngII levels over time, specifically between weeks 1-2 and week 4 post-vaccination (Fig. 2B). Of note, the increase in anti-AngII IgG titers was more substantial after the vaccination boost at week 3. These results demonstrate that anti-AngII autoantibodies can be induced in mice by vaccination against Spike or RBD, in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least with MPLA/Alum-containing adjuvants.

Figure. 2. Development of anti-AngII autoantibodies in a subset of mice vaccinated with adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Mice were vaccinated at week 0 and 3 with Spike or RBD proteins adjuvanted with MPLA/alum, CpG-B, AddaS03 or with no adjuvant, or with MPLA/alum only (in absence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen). N=10-25 mice per group. (A) Anti-AngII levels in vaccinated mice plasma at week 4. Significant proportions of mice vaccinated with RBD + MPLA/alum or Spike + MPLA/alum raised autoantibodies against AngII (Z-test for proportions: RBD+MPLA/alum vs MPLA/alum: Z=2.35, Spike+MPLA/alum vs. MPLA/alum: Z=2.45, grey threshold = limit for anti-AngII positivity). (B) Levels of anti-AngII autoantibodies over time (at week 1, 2, 3 and 4) in the mice that were found positive for anti-AngII at week 4 (Friedman test with Dunn's post-test).
Having determined that anti-AngII antibodies could develop both in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and in mice after vaccination with MPLA/alum-adjuvanted SARSCoV-2 antigens, we further examined hospitalized COVID-19 patients for potential correlative effects of anti-AngII antibodies on blood pressure dysregulation, blood oxygenation, and disease severity. First, we observed that the levels of anti-AngII were significantly higher in patients with dysregulated blood pressure (BP), as defined by (i) episodes of hypotension that required administration of vasopressors, (ii) large daily fluctuations in blood pressure (daily mean arterial pressure range (MAP)  70 mmHg), or (iii) at least 2 consecutive days of hypotension (MAP < 65 mmHg) in patients with preexisting HTN (Fig. 3A). Moreover, this correlation remained significant when each of these subgroups were analyzed separately, despite the low number of patients available

(Fig. 3B). Of note, these 3 subgroups of patients with dysregulated PB are not exclusive, with 52% of patients belonging to multiple categories. Consistent with these observations, a majority of patients with blood pressure dysregulation were positive for anti-AngII (81% vs. 53% in patients with normal blood pressure, Fig. 3C), among which 45% had high levels of anti-AngII. And finally, patients needing vasopressors were the most likely to have positive or high levels of anti-AngII, although among each of the groups with dysregulated blood pressure, >80% were anti-AngII(+) (Fig. 3D).
Since AngII is a critical regulator of blood pressure, we further hypothesized that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing HTN might be more sensitive to the effects of antiAngII antibodies, if they were sufficiently abundant to alter the angiotensin signaling cascade. Therefore, we separated the patients with normal or dysregulated BP into subsets of patients with or without pre-existing HTN. Nevertheless, we found no striking difference between the non-HTN vs. HTN subsets that could support enhanced effects of anti-AngII in COVID patients with pre-existing HTN (Fig. 3E).
Next, we questioned whether the presence or levels of anti-AngII antibodies correlated with reduced blood oxygenation and disease severity, measured via the daily mean oximetric saturation (SF ratio), which is the ratio of peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). For each patient, we selected the lowest daily mean SF ratio value obtained within a two-day window of the measurement of antiAngII. The lowest daily mean SF ratio was compared between the COVID-19 patients who developed auto-antibodies against AngII (73 patients) and those who did not (42 patients). We found that the SF ratio was strongly reduced in anti-AngII(+) patients (Fig. 3F), demonstrating a correlation between anti-AngII antibodies and reduced blood oxygenation in these patients.

dysregulated BP, categorized as being under vasopressive drugs, exhibiting a large mean arterial pressure variability (large MAP) or having experienced severe acute hypotensive episodes despite their known pre-existing HTN condition (these categories are non-exclusive; KruskalWallis test with Dunn's post-test comparison to normal BP). (C) Proportion of patients with normal or dyregulated BP that have negative (-), low (Lo) or high (Hi) levels of anti-AngII antibodies (2 test).

(E) Proportions of patients with negative, low or high levels of anti-AngII in COVID patients with pre-existing HTN and/or dysregulated BP.

(H) Proportion of patients with negative (-), low (Lo) or high (Hi) levels of anti-AngII antibodies in function to the severity of the disease (2 test).
Since the clinical severity of COVID directly depends on the patient's blood oxygenation, patients with SF ratio  314 are considered as having a disease of low severity, while patients with SF ratio < 235 suffer from a highly severe form of COVID. Based on this, we then compared anti-AngII levels with disease severity and found that patients with severe vs. mild disease had increased anti-AngII antibodies (p=0.053, Fig. 3G). Similarly, we found a significant increase in the proportion of anti-AngII(+) patients along with disease severity (p=0.035 by 2 test, Fig. 3H). Indeed, 77% of patients with severe disease were anti-AngII(+), including 41% with high levels, as compared to 50% and 29%, respectively, in patients with mild disease.
Together, these results demonstrate a correlation between the presence and levels of anti-AngII in COVID-19 patients and dysregulated blood pressure, lower blood oxygenation, and increased disease severity. While causal relationships cannot be drawn from these correlations, the fact that AngII is a key regulator of blood pressure in humans suggests that antibodies directed against anti-AngII could alter AngII signaling pathways, including its binding to and signaling via the angiotensin receptors AT1 and AT2. as well as on its enzymatic conversion by ACE2. Further experiments are needed

to establish the pathophysiological consequences of anti-AngII auto-antibodies in COVID-19 patients.
Because anti-AngII antibodies developed in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients or vaccination with some adjuvants in mice, we hypothesized that anti-AngII antibodies may result from molecular structural mimicry between the AngII peptide and certain epitopes present in Spike or RBD. In that case, anti-AngII and antiRBD could potentially cross-bind to both antigens. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the binding of two murine IgG monoclonal anti-AngII antibodies (clone E7 and clone B938M) to recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike or RBD. We found that both monoclonal anti-AngII antibodies bound to Spike and RBD, although with a lower affinity to RBD than to Spike (Fig. 4A). We further demonstrated that the monoclonal anti-AngII antibodies may interfere with AngII binding to its cognate receptor AT1, suggesting that AngII-AT1 signaling could be modulated by the presence of anti-AngII (Fig. 4B).
Conversely, we evaluated the ability of monoclonal anti-RBD antibodies, in a library of those isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, to bind to AngII. Among the 36 different monoclonal anti-RBD antibodies assessed, 9 showed some low to very-low binding to AngII, with one being superior to the others, namely clone S24-902 (Fig. 4C). We further confirmed the significant although low binding of 3 of these anti-RBD to AngII, respectively S24-902, S564-265 and S24-1002, by characterizing their affinity at various concentrations (Fig. 4D). In contrast, clone S564-14 did not show any specific binding to AngII and was used as a negative control. It is not surprising that the cross-reactivity of anti-RBD to AngII is low, considering that monoclonal anti-AngII also binds weakly to RBD (Fig. 4A) and that AngII is a short 8-amino acid peptide.
We then sought to identify the epitopes of Spike or RBD that lead to crossreactivity to AngII. To do so, we tested the binding of the two monoclonal anti-AngII antibodies (clones E7 and B938M) to linear epitopes of Spike, using a peptide array that consists of a library of 15-mer peptides, shifted by 5 amino acids, covering the full-length of Spike. As a control for nonspecific binding, we used the secondary antibody only, in

the absence of anti-AngII antibody. Both anti-AngII E7 and B938M clones bound to several linear epitopes on Spike, with a main target at Spike residues aa1146-aa1160 located near the C-terminus, outside of RBD (Fig. 4E, Fig. S3A-C, spot J14 on the peptide array), and about 15 secondary targets of lower affinity. Five of the secondary peptides targeted by the clone E7 belong to the RBD of Spike, including 3 more particularly to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the RBD (Fig. 4E, Fig. S3A). In contrast, only 1 peptide targeted by the B938M clone belongs to the RBD region, in the RBM (Fig. 4E, Fig. S3B). Of note, although both Spike and AngII share the same receptor, ACE-2, their binding on ACE-2 occurs at 2 distinct locations (Fig. S4) (10, 11). Importantly, most regions targeted by clones E7 and/or B938M have been characterized as being the main B cells epitopes in COVID patients (colored regions in Fig. 4E, F, Fig. S3D) (12, 13). These regions, which are likely to contain the epitopes generating anti-AngII autoantibodies, are (1) aa21-aa40, (2) aa447-aa468, (3) aa551-aa585, (4) aa786-aa804, (5) aa1131-1160 of Spike.
We next compared the Spike epitopes targeted by polyclonal responses raised against RBD/Spike in vaccinated mice or in COVID patients to the ones targeted by the monoclonal anti-AngII. Thus, we repeated the peptide array assays using anti-AngII(+) or anti-AngII(-) pooled sera from 5 different mice vaccinated with Spike + MPLA/alum or RBD + MPLA/alum, or from 5 different COVID-19 patients.

low binding). (D) Binding of 3 selected monoclonal anti-RBD (S24-902, S564-265 and S24-1002) to AngII at various concentrations as compared to a non-AngII-binding anti-RBD (S564-14).

Highlighted colored regions represents the most immunogenic and recurrent B cell epitopes of Spike found in COVID patients (Shrock et al. (12), Li et al. (13)) and the associated numbers indicate the amino-acid positions that delineate these regions. The x-axis represents the fulllength of Spike (SP = signal peptide; NTD = N-terminal domain; RBD = receptor-binding domain; RBM = receptor-binding motif; CTD = C-terminal domain; NTD, RBD and CTD together constitutes the S1 domain of Spike; T = transmembrane domain; C = cytoplasmic tail). (F) Visualization of the main domains targeted by the monoclonal anti-AngII antibodies on the 3D structure of Spike (PDB=6VXX, (14)). Domains are highlighted in colors on one monomer of the trimeric Spike structure (RBD is in black; aa# = amino acid position of Spike).
We observed that mice raised anti-Spike/RBD antibodies in all regions previously targeted by the monoclonal anti-AngII upon vaccination with Spike+MPLA/alum (Fig. S5A), while mostly in the region aa447-aa468 upon vaccination by RBD+MPLA/alum (Fig. S5B). The profiles of anti-AngII(+) and anti-AngII(-) mice were very similar, except for a small increase in binding of anti-Spike to the region aa447aa468 and anti-RBD to aa551-585, in anti-AngII(+) mice. As to the COVID-19 patients, they raised anti-Spike antibodies against 3 out of the 5 anti-AngII-targeted regions, namely aa551-aa585, aa786-aa804 and aa1131-1160, with a slightly higher binding observed to aa786-aa804 in anti-AngII(+) plasma (Fig. S5C). Surprisingly, the region aa1131-1160 was better targeted in anti-AngII(-) plasma; this highlights that not every antibody that bind to anti-AngII-targeting regions would necessarily cross-react with AngII.
Taken together, using monoclonal anti-AngII and anti-RBD antibodies, we demonstrate that antibody cross-binding between AngII and Spike/RBD can occur, even if weakly, which may suggest some structural homology between AngII and certain epitopes of Spike/RBD.

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to induce broad immune dysregulation (15, 16), including generation of wide-ranging autoantibody responses (17). For example, generation of autoantibodies against phospholipids has been shown to contribute to coagulation disorders (18, 19), and against Type I interferons to reduced immune response to infection (20). Here, we show that autoantibodies can be generated against AngII, a key regulator of vascular tension. We further show that generation of anti-AngII autoantibodies correlated with disease severity as reflected in dysregulation of vascular tension and lower blood oxygenation. This, along with our in vitro signaling data, suggests that the anti-AngII autoantibodies, even if low affinity, may be able to interfere with signaling between AngII and its receptors AT1 and ACE-2. Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients had also been shown to develop autoantibodies against AT1 and ACE-2, which similarly correlated with enhanced pro-inflammatory responses and increased disease severity (21, 22). Such autoantibodies against AT1 and ACE-2 have been also observed in patients suffering from other vascular pathologies, particularly in malignant hypertension (8) or constrictive vasculopathy (9). Therefore, systematic quantification of autoantibodies against key molecules of the renin-angiotensin pathway (i.e. AngII, AT1, and ACE-2), in diseases characterized by vascular dysregulation, including COVID-19, might reveal a common underlying autoimmune etiology. Lastly, we highlighted the immune epitopes of Spike that could share structural homology with AngII, providing molecular insights in the immune mechanisms that could lead to the generation of anti-AngII autoantibodies upon infection by SARS-CoV-2.

We report persistent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in a patient with HIV/AIDS; the virus developed spike N terminal domain and receptor binding domain neutralization resistance mutations. Our findings suggest that immunocompromised patients can harbor emerging variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
In December 2020, a 61-year-old woman living with HIV/AIDS was tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection at a community testing center in California, USA; she produced an anterior nasal swab sample that tested positive by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). At the time of sample collection, she had a 10-day history of nonproductive cough, and was not receiving antiretroviral therapy (Figure). Her CD4 count was

13 cells/µL and HIV-1 viral load was 262,000 copies/ mL. She never required hospitalization for SARSCoV-2 infection. Thirty days after symptom onset, she no longer had respiratory symptoms and underwent SARS-CoV-2 screening upon admission to Stanford Hospital (Stanford, CA, USA) for treatment of a severe decubitus ulcer. Her nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) sample tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RTPCR (cycle threshold [Ct] value 17.6). We detected minus-strand viral RNA, indicating active viral replication (1). On day 33, three days after admission to Stanford Hospital, antibody testing showed plasma positive for IgM against SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) but negative for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 (2,3). She began antiretroviral therapy (ART) 38 days after symptom onset. On day 45, an NPS sample tested positive (Ct 16.6) for SARSCoV-2 with detectable minus-strand RNA.
Because the patient had ongoing viral replication, we conducted whole-genome sequencing using archived nucleic acids from the NPS samples collected on days 30 and 45. We enriched the viral genome using laboratory-developed multiplex RT-PCR reactions that generated multiple overlapping amplicons of 1,200 bp. We prepared fragment libraries using NEBNext DNA Library Prep reagents (New England Biolabs, https://www.neb.com) according to the manufacturer's instructions; we sequenced the libraries on Illumina MiSeq with single-end 150-cycle sequencing using MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (https://www. illumina.com). We assembled the consensus sequences and identified mutations using a custom bioinformatics pipeline and SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession no. NC_45512.2) as reference. For these 2 samples we observed mean whole-genome coverage of 963× (day 30) and 894× (day 45). We used the consensus sequences from the day 30 (GISAID accession no. EPI_ISL_2009056) and day 45 (GISAID accession no. EPI_ISL_2009057) samples to query the GISAID CoVserver (https://www.gisaid.org) and

Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages (PANGOLIN, https://pangolin.cog-uk.io) to determine clade and lineage.
The sequence from the sample taken on day 30 revealed a G clade, B.1.234 lineage virus (Table). Because the day 45 sequence shares 18 mutations (8 synonymous and 10 nonsynonynmous) with the day 30 sequence and is the most closely related sequence to the day 30 sequence in GISAID, we believe the day 45 sequence probably evolved from the day 30 sequence. The day 45 sequence contained additional spike mutations, including C15F (variant percent 44.3%), del141_144 (17.5%), Y248N (13.4%), ins248_Y/LLSFN (44.5%), and E484Q (67.7%) (Table). The cysteine residue at position 15 (C15) in the spike N terminal domain (NTD) is linked by a disulfide bond to C136; mutations at either of these positions alter this bond and reduce neutralization by monoclonal antibodies (4). Deletions and insertions in the NTD are also involved in immune escape, including the common del141_144 mutation and insertions at position Y248 (5). The E484Q mutation is located in the RBD domain of the spike gene and is also found in the Kappa variant of interest (i.e., B.1.617.1) (6). Viruses harboring E484Q have reduced susceptibility to monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma, and vaccinee plasma (7,8).
The patient showed SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion on day 51, thirteen days after initiating ART. SARS-CoV-2 antibody isotypes typically follow a similar time-course; IgM, IgA, and IgG usually become detectable 14 days after illness onset (2). This patient's delayed IgG class switch was probably caused by HIV/AIDS-associated B-cell dysfunction; we hypothesize that the ineffective IgM response might have selected for the observed spike mutations (9). On day 55, seventeen days after initiating ART, the patient's HIV-1 viral load was 330 copies/mL. An NPS sample collected that day was negative for minus-strand SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the viral load had

decreased >1,000-fold (Ct 27.2). The patient's SARSCoV-2 infection remained asymptomatic throughout her hospitalization. On day 93, she produced an NPS sample that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
In summary, we describe an HIV-positive patient who had a prolonged course of asymptomatic, active SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to the emergence of NTD and RBD mutations associated with reduced antibody neutralization. Our findings add to the accumulating evidence that immunocompromised persons, including persons living with HIV/AIDS, might host ongoing SARS-CoV-2 replication that could enable the development of variants of concern/interest (F. Karim, unpub. data, https://www.medrxiv.org/ content/10.1101/2021.06.03.21258228v1). The emergence of multiple spike mutations in this patient over a relatively short timeframe (i.e., 15 days) further highlights the potential role of persons living with uncontrolled HIV as possible sources of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Finally, these findings emphasize the need to diagnose HIV in the >6 million infected persons worldwide who are unaware of their status and provide them with accessible ART. These interventions are critical for overall global health and might also contribute to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.

In May 2021, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was detected in Asiatic lions in a zoological park in India. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed the SARS-CoV-2 strains were the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant. To reduce transmission of variants of concern, surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wild animal populations should be increased.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in natural conditions, has shown a broad host susceptibility range (1). Identifying susceptible animal species, reservoirs, and cross-species transmission is a global scientific and public health concern. We found evidence of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) caused by the lineage B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant (World Health Organization nomenclature). We provide coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case information and detailed genomic characterization.
Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Chennai, India, houses 13 Asiatic lions, 9 in a lion safari and 2 each in separate moat enclosures. Beginning May 21, 2021, four of the safari lions started showing signs of loss of appetite, nasal discharge, and occasional coughing. Nasal swab, rectal swab, and fecal samples were collected from 11 lions during May 24-29, 2021, and sent to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (Bhopal, India) for molecular investigations (Appendix Table 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/ article/27/10/21-1500-App1.pdf).
We used the VIRALDTECT II Multiplex Real Time PCR Kit for COVID-19 (Genes2Me, https://genes2me. com) to confirm SARS-CoV-2 in 9/11 lions. The other 2 lions were sampled on June 19, 2021, and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. We also used a World Organisation for Animal Health-recommended reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) method to test for canine distemper virus on samples from all 13 lions; all tested negative (2). Two of the infected lions died of COVID-19, one on June 3 and the other on June 16, 2021.
After we confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed whole-genome sequencing directly from nasal swab specimens of 4 lions that initially showed symptoms by using the MinION sequencing platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, https://nanoporetech. com) (Appendix). We deposited sequences in GenBank (accession nos. MZ363851-4) and GISAID (https:// www.gisaid.org; accession nos. EPI_ISL_2821077-80).
To elucidate the temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 among the lions, we downloaded 310 complete SARSCoV-2 genomes from GISAID (3) that had high coverage and were sequenced from the Tamil Nadu state of

We employed a multifaceted computational strategy to identify the genetic factors contributing to increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection from a Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) dataset of a cohort of 2000 Italian patients. We coupled a stratified k-fold screening, to rank variants more associated with severity, with the training of multiple supervised classifiers, to predict severity based on screened features. Feature importance analysis from tree-based models allowed us to identify 16 variants with the highest support which, together with age and gender covariates, were found to be most predictive of COVID-19 severity. When tested on a follow-up cohort, our ensemble of models predicted severity with high accuracy (ACC = 81.88%; AUCROC = 96%; MCC = 61.55%). Our model recapitulated a vast literature of emerging molecular mechanisms and genetic factors linked to COVID-19 response and extends previous landmark Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). It revealed a network of interplaying genetic signatures converging on established immune system and inflammatory processes linked to viral infection response. It also identified additional processes cross-talking with immune pathways, such as GPCR signaling, which might offer additional opportunities for therapeutic intervention and patient stratification. Publicly available PheWAS datasets revealed that several variants were significantly associated with phenotypic traits such as "Respiratory or thoracic disease", supporting their link with COVID-19 severity outcome.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is challenging health, economical and societal systems worldwide at an unprecedented level. The SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by a large variation in consequence ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening conditions such as viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is caused by an exaggerated host immune response leading to lung injury, which starts at the epithelial-interstitium-endothelial interface with increased vascular permeability and extravasation of immune cells, mostly macrophages, and granulocytes. Infected epithelial cells and debris bind immune cell receptors, triggering the release of inflammatory cytokines (predominantly IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-) and activating fibroblasts, resulting in a cytokine release syndrome1.
Established host risk factors for disease severity, such as increasing age, male gender, and higher body mass index2, do not explain all the variability in disease severity observed across individuals. Genetic factors contributing to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity may provide novel biological insights into disease pathogenesis mechanisms, new drug targets as well as new means for patient stratification. It is important to consider that, despite the recent development of vaccines, treating the disease remains an important goal in the clinics. The first genetic factors described to contribute to COVID-19 severity were rare loss-offunction variants in genes involved in type I interferon (IFN) responses3-7. At the same time, several GWAS projects investigating the contribution of common genetic variation8,9 to COVID-19 have provided robust support for the involvement of various genomic loci associated with COVID-19 severity and susceptibility, with the strongest finding for severity being located on chromosome 3. Until now, the Italian GEN-COVID Multicenter Study contributed to the identification of rare variants 6,10 and common polymorphisms11-13 associated with COVID-19 severity through the collection of more than two thousand biospecimens and clinical data from SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals14 and whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis. The COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (COVID-19 HGI) (https:// www.COVID-19hg.org) has recently provided the most comprehensive picture of host genetic factors linked to COVID-19 severity through meta-analyses of tens of studies from 19 countries15.
While GWAS studies provide solid evidence of the host genetic factors individually associated with COVID-19 severity, they most often fail to provide an organic picture about their interplay. By learning (non-)linear patterns from data in a human interpretable fashion, explainable machine learning algorithms might help in understanding the multifactorial nature of the interactions between host genetics and COVID-19, at the same time providing effective tools for risk and severity forecasting.
In 2020, the Italian GEN-COVID Multicenter Study started to investigate how the combination of common and rare variants could determine COVID-19 severity in a pilot study including WES data of a first small cohort of hospitalized patients16. Previous and ongoing efforts entailed machine learning techniques (i.e. LASSO logistic regression models) in combination with a boolean representation of genetic variants to identify the most informative features associated with the severity which were used to compile an Integrated PolyGenic Score for COVID-19 severity predictions17,18. In this study, we combined variant case-control screening, supervised binary classifiers training, feature importance analysis, and dimensionality reduction techniques with pathway enrichment and phenotype association studies to identify a few dozens genetic variants contributing to increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection from a Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) dataset of a cohort of Italian patients.

Results
Comparing genetic variation in severe and asymptomatic individuals. We considered the Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) dataset of germline variants from 1982 European descent patients provided by the GEN-COVID Multicenter Study group14. All subjects were classified according to the grading scheme by the World Health Organization (WHO), refined based on an ordinal logistic model using age as input feature for sex-stratified patients17. Demographic (sex, age, and ethnicity) and clinical data (family history, pre-existing chronic conditions, and SARS-CoV-2 related symptoms) were also collected (Fig. 1a; see "Methods").
We started our analysis from a total of 1.057 M simple variants which were screened to identify mutations associated with severe patients, likely representing risk factors, from those associated with asymptomatic patients, more likely contributing to protection. We employed log odds ratio statistics, using an additive model, to screen variants significantly associated with either severe or asymptomatic groups (Fig. 1a, b; see "Methods"). We performed the screening on the majority portion (training set) of a randomly split dataset (keeping 80% of the samples for training and 20% for testing), to find a set of variants to be used as features set for downstream ML and pathways analysis. To ensure robustness, we repeated the splitting procedure five times, employing a stratified five fold cross-validation scheme, by performing the screening on the training set and finally retaining those variants found to be significantly enriched in each of the five splits (Fig. 1d; see "Methods"). We found on average 1130 variants significantly enriched across the five folds (Data S1).
Genetic variants predict severity through supervised ML classifiers. We embedded the stratified five fold screening within a supervised classifier training procedure (Fig. 1d; see "Methods"). For each random split of the dataset, we trained the model by considering the variants screened in the training set (80% of the original dataset),and tested it on the corresponding held-out portion (20% of the dataset) of the same split. For each screened random split, we trained multiple models using a stratified five fold Cross-validation (five fold CV) grid search to estimate optimal hyperparameters for supervised classifiers training (Fig. 1d; see "Methods"). XGBoost was the algorithm that displayed the smallest drops between training and testing accuracies, achieving the best average performance during testing across the five folds (Fig. 2a; Data S2). In more details, the best XGBoost model had the following performances: Precision=77.27%, Recall=83.33%, MCC = 46.69%, AUCROC = 80, Accuracy=75%, F1 = 80.2% (Data S2).
Overall, we found that 3217 unique variants (out of a total of 3258 unique, screened variants), corresponding to 2546 unique genes, had non-zero coefficients in at least one of the five, treebased models (i.e. RF or XGBoost). However, the XGBoost classifier led to a sharper reduction of relevant variants (1086, corresponding to 1049 genes, with non-zero feature importance in at least one model), consisting of a subset of those identified with the RF models. As expected, clinical covariates such as age and gender were found among the features with the highest median of the distribution of importance coefficients collected from XGBoost models (Fig. 2b). Among this shortlist, only 16 variants (and corresponding genes; Data S1) consistently received non-zero coefficients in all tree-based models, out of which 9 variants were found to be enriched among severe patients (Fig. 2b, c). To confirm the predictive performance of these variants, we re-trained the models by considering only this subset of variants, plus age and gender covariates, and we calculated aggregated performances by considering the median of the probabilities outputted by each model for each sample in the testing set (see "Methods"). While age and gender covariates

alone retained high predictive power (AUCROC = 80%), the addition of these most informative genetic features led to an increase of performances (AUCROC = 86%, best model AUCROC = 91%; Fig. 2d; Data S3).
We observed a high level of performance when we tested the ensemble of models trained with only informative variants on a follow-up cohort of 618 individuals (122 asymptomatic, 496 severe; Fig. 1c), either at the individual model level or at the ensemble one (Data S4). In fact, when computing aggregated metrics by considering the median of the probability distribution collected from the ensemble of models (Data S4, 5; see "Methods"), we identified severe patients with good accuracy (ACC = 81.88%; AUCROC = 96%), performing considerably better than the ones obtained by training with only covariates or variants (Fig. 2e; Data S4). The model also showed good performances on an additional validation set comprising a total of 375 samples excluded from both training and testing due to inconsistent classification from the WHO grading and the ordinal logistic model adjusted by age (ACC = 85.34%, MCC = 67.8%, AUCROC = 91.4%; Fig. S1; Data S6).
Risk and protective genetic factors impinge on modular, interconnected networks underlying distinct biological processes. We analyzed the subset of variants receiving non-zero feature importance in at least one XGBoost model to provide a

mechanistic explanation for their potential interaction with COVID-19 infection. We performed pathway analysis by mapping mutated genes in a functional interaction (FI) network (i.e., Reactome FI network; see Methods). We built a general FI network (Fig. 3b), as well as networks specific for clinical groups, by grouping variants and genes enriched in severe and asymptomatic patients (Fig. 3a). Pathway analysis on group-specific networks revealed patterns of significantly enriched processes connected to either risk or protection (Fig. 3a).
In severe patients we found significant processes associated with cardiomyopathies, e.g. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (FDR = 4.03E-05), Calcium signaling pathways (FDR = 4.22E-02), and immune response such as C-type leptin receptors (CLRs) (FDR = 5.67E-02) (Fig. 3a; Data S7). Asymptomatic patients were instead characterized by distinct processes, including Fanconi anemia pathway (FDR = 7.89E-04) and DNA repair processes such as HDR through HRR or SSA (FDR = 4.84E-03), (Fig. 3a; Data S8).
The general FI network comprised a total of 344 mutated genes and 630 functional interactions, marking a high degree of interconnection between affected genes, which participate in different, cross-talking biological processes. Cluster analysis on the general FI network revealed modules characterized by specific pathways. Intriguingly, we found out that no cluster exclusively contained variants enriched in severe or asymptomatic patients. In detail, the largest cluster (i.e. Module 1; 43 nodes) encompassed

The top 3 modules identified within the network are highlighted and corresponding enriched processes displayed as barcharts colored with cluster specific corresponding colors; c FI network zoomed representation of the 2nd largest cluster.

Fanconi anemia pathway (FDR = 2.46E-07) and DNA repair processes such as HDR through HRR or SSA (FDR = 4.51E-06) or Homologous recombination (FDR = 1.76E-03) (Fig. 3b). In this cluster, we found that the gene characterized by the variant with the strongest model support (ms) (i.e. fraction of tree-based models assigning non-zero feature importance; see Methods) is MYBBP1A

rs117615621, which is enriched in asymptomatic patients (Odds Ratio OR) = 0.26; p value = 6.5E-03; ms = 90%; (Data S1, S8).

(Fig. 3b, c). We also found processes more directly linked to the immune and inflammatory response to the virus, such as the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (FDR = 1.11E-03), Cytokinecytokine receptor interaction (FDR = 1.92E-03), and Interleukin-6 family signaling (FDR = 1.92E-03) (Fig. 3b, c). All three pathways include the CNTFR gene, which codes for the alpha subunit of the receptor for the ciliary neurotrophic factor, and is affected by a novel variant (chr9:34557898:A: T) enriched in severe patients (lor=1.230663067; p val=2.2E-04; Data S1). Intriguingly this variant was ranked in the top 20 genes with the highest median importance (Fig. 2b) and received 100% model support (Fig. 2c). Another variant with 100% support within the same cluster is rs150021157, which is significantly enriched among severe patients (OR = 3.95; p val=1.9E-03; Data S1,S8), and it affects the PCSK5 gene, a serine endoprotease which processes various proteins including cytokines, NGF, renin and which has been reported to regulate the viral life cycle19.
The third-largest module (Module 3; 38 nodes) is characterized by the Regulation of nuclear SMAD2/3 signaling pathway (FDR = 1.95E-03) as the most enriched pathway, therefore being tightly interconnected with cluster 2. The variant SMAD3 rs897912452 (OR = 0.31; p val=5.1E-4) and the novel ZMIZ1 10:79307376:-:GGGGGGGGGG (OR = 0.27; p val=6.18E-05) have the highest support (ms=90%) and are found enriched in asymptomatic patients. Additionally, the latter gene ZMIZ1 participates in another significant pathway, Coregulation of Androgen receptor activity (FDR = 0.01), which also entails AR, which carries several mutations which, depending on the specific genic locus, can be found enriched either in severe or asymptomatic patients with variable support (Fig. 3, S2; Data S1, S8).
We found additional potentially relevant pathways in the remaining modules. Module 4 (33 nodes) contains genes involved in Deubiquitination (FDR = 1.15E-05), a process frequently modified by viral infection20, as well as several other pathways mediating innate immune response such as the TNF receptor signaling pathway (FDR = 1.15E-05) (Fig. S3; Data S9). Within this module we found the PLEC gene, affected by the variant rs140300753 (OR = 3.2, p val=2.8E-03, ms=100%), which is enriched in severity and received 100% support from tree-based models (Data S1).
In the remaining clusters we found additional processes with high translational and therapeutic potential. For instance, we found several GPCR-signaling instances significantly enriched in Modules 6 (e.g. G alpha (i) signaling events, FDR = 3.69E-04) and 8, which exclusively entails GPCR-downstream signaling pathways and where again the G alpha (i) signaling events (FDR = 2.56E-09) and G alpha (q) signaling events (FDR = 4.83E-08) are the two downstream pathways most significantly over-represented (Fig. S4; Data S9).
We also found that a few genes whose variants have been identified through our pipeline are among the ones carrying top associations to severity as assessed from studies of the COVID-19 HGI (https://app.COVID-19hg.org/variants)15. In detail, variants of 9 out of the 43 genes identified from GWAS studies are also present in our list, including: ABO, ARL17A, ARL17B, DPP9, LRRC37A, LRRC37A2, RAVER1, TMEM65, ZBTB11 (Data S1).
Severe patients tend to cluster together using only more informative variants. We applied unsupervised clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques (i.e. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) to group patients based on the genetic distance calculated by considering the most informative variants selected after screening and supervised machine learning procedure. By projecting the patients on the first two PCs followed by k-means clustering (see "Methods"), we detected three groups of patients

in the original cohort (Fig. 4a-c). The two largest clusters were separated by PC1. The largest one, 515 patients, was characterized by a majority of severe cases (78% of the total). The second cluster was instead characterized by a prevalence of asymptomatic patients (70% of the total). Finally, a third small cluster was identified through the combined usage of PC1 and PC2 and it was characterized almost exclusively by severe patients (95% of 24 patients in total). Notably, the severity of this cluster is only partially explained on the basis of either gender (59% males and 37% females; Fig. 4c) or age (Fig. S5a). This cluster was characterized by peculiar genetic features, with a smaller number of variants and a neat prevalence of risk over protection factors (Fig. S5b). Remarkably, a total of 7 (out of 9 overall enriched in severe patients) variants with 100% support from XGB models were also found in this cluster (Data S10). Network analysis of the mutated genes in this predominantly severe cluster highlighted several common processes as well as candidates for drug targeting. In particular, several GPCRs (ADRB2, ADRA1, GRM6), ion channels (GRIN1, CACNA1G), (receptor tyrosine) kinases (NTRK1, CSF1R, GAK) and nuclear hormone receptors (AR, THRB) participate to this network and can be readily targeted by approved drugs (Fig. 4c; Data S11).
Important variants are associated with disease traits linked to COVID-19 severe phenotypes. To provide further evidence of a functional relationships between our variants and COVID-19 severe phenotypes, we checked available open-access integrative resources (i.e. Open Target Genetics initiative21) which aggregate human GWAS and functional genomics data to link between GWAS-associated loci, variants, and likely causal genes. In particular, we considered Phenome Wide Association Study (PheWAS) analysis considering a wide range of diseases and traits to identify the phenotypes associated with our variants (see Methods). Intriguingly, we found that many identified variants are associated with traits or phenotypes which might be linked with either risk or protection from severe consequences to the viral infection.
For example, by considering variants with non-zero importance in at least one XGB model, we found that those enriched in severe patients were 70% of the total associated with the category "respiratory or thoracic diseases" (see Fig. 5A). Among the specific traits with strong associations to more supported variants, we found instances such as "Doctor diagnosed emphysema" (ITPKA, rs41277684; LTK, rs35932273), the latter variant associated also to "Other alveolar and parietoalveolar pneumopathy", "Respiratory disorders in diseases classified elsewhere" (KCNB1, rs34467662), "Chronic bronchitis/emphysema" (C12orf43;HNF1A, rs11065390; SLC47A2, rs34399035), "Acute sinusitis" (SHANK2, rs146204677), "Pleural plaque" (CFAP74, rs141833643), "Allergic asthma" (SYTL2, rs61740616 and rs35751209), "Symptoms and signs involving the circulatory and respiratory systems" (PCSK5, rs150021157) (Fig. 5b). Although more weakly associated and supported by our models, we also found several associations with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) both in "respiratory or thoracic diseases" and in "infectious disease" categories (Data S12). Other disease categories displaying a net prevalence of phenotypic associations for variants enriched among severe were "immune system disease", with multiple variants associated with specific traits such as "Autoimmune diseases" "Immunodeficiency with predominantly antibody defects" or "Noninfectious disorders of lymphatic channels", and "pancreatic disease" (Fig. 5a; Data S12).
Two of the variants enriched among severe patients which had highest importance in all our models (i.e. PCSK5 rs150021157 and PLEC rs140300753) were significantly associated with the

"Abnormalities of breathing" phenotype (p val = 4E-06 and p val = 1.6E-04, respectively), suggesting that patients carrying these variants might be at higher risk due to pre-existing difficulties of breathing (Fig. S6; Data S12).
Other general categories of traits that might be linked to severe COVID-19, such as "Cardiovascular disease" or "Infectious disease" showed similar distributions of associations of risk or mitigation factors (Fig. S7). Interestingly other categories, such as "Integumentary system disease" showed instead a prevalence of associations with mitigation factors (Fig. S7).
Discussion In this study, we have set up a multifaceted computational strategy to dissect patient genetic variants which might interplay

with the SARS-Cov-2 virus to increase the risk of, or to protect from, a severe response to infection.
We integrated into a stratified k-fold scheme a pipeline to perform variant features screening followed by machine learning model training and testing to robustly identify variants associated with severe response to COVID-19 infection. Our pipeline allowed a drastic reduction of the initial number of variants by several orders of magnitudes: from an initial set of approximately 1 M unique variants derived from WES to 1k variants receiving non-zero feature importance in at least one of the tree-based models. By only considering the variants with full support, i.e. always found to have non-zero feature importance in all the treebased models, we further reduced the pool to only 16 variants. Models retrained with only full-support variants (plus age and gender as covariates) achieved superior performances (median

AUCROC = 86%, best model AUCROC = 91%). Although models trained with only patients age and gender already showed good performances in severity prediction (median AUCROC = 80%), confirming the predictive power of these covariates, the increase in performance followed by the inclusion of curated genetic information provides the foundation for integrated tools for COVID-19 severity forecast and patient stratification. When tested on a follow-up cohort of more than 600 our models achieved remarkable performances in identifying severe patients with good accuracy (ACC = 81.88% and AUCROC = 96%), performing considerably better than the ones obtained by training with only covariates or variants (Fig. 2e; Data S4).
The interpretability of our models allowed us to shed new light on the complex landscape of genetic interactions with virus genetics which contributed to a severe response to COVID-19 in an Italian cohort. Among the 16 variants with 100% support, only 6 genes (37%) were annotated in the largest

pathway knowledgebase, i.e. Reactome22, suggesting that unannotated variants might modulate the interaction with the virus through yet-to-be-discovered biological mechanisms. Intriguingly, we found that two of these highly supported variants, i.e. chr9:34557898:A:T (CNTFR) and rs150021157 (PCSK5) interact within the second-largest module identified on the interaction network of the genes affected by mutations within our study. This cluster, which is moreover the only one characterized by two fully supported variants, is highly enriched in pathways linked to immune response and inflammation, such as the such as JAKSTAT signaling pathway, Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and Interleukin-6 family signaling. The third cluster, which crosstalks with the second one, involves processes related to SMAD and TGF- signaling, which were previously shown to be modulated by SARS nucleocapsid proteins23.
We found that variants enriched in severe patients are involved in cardiomyopathies processes, supporting the established notion

that patients with heart disease or its risk factors are at greater
risk of severe consequences following COVID-19 infection, including hospitalization, ventilation, or death24. Additional processes significantly enriched among severe mutations was
ECM, whose importance in mediating the interaction with viral particles have been highlighted by affinity-purification proteomics experiments25. Recent experiments also confirmed a role for
integrins in binding to UV-inactivated viral particles, through which outside-inside signaling is elicited via binding to G1326.
Vesicle-mediated transport, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis, has been shown to mediate a key entry point for SARS27. The latter pathway has also been confirmed to drive a chronic immune response in severe COVID-1928. Moreover, C-type
leptin receptors have been shown to engage with the virus inducing robust pro-inflammatory responses in myeloid cells that correlated with COVID-19 severity29.
On the other hand, some of the processes that we found significantly enriched among asymptomatic patients have been
previously put in connection to SARS viral infection. For exam-
ple, members of the machinery for DNA damage response have
been shown to interact and affect the response to several DNA and RNA viruses30 and it has been recently demonstrated that
these pathways are also triggered by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro cellular models31. The Fanconi anemia pathway is tightly linked to DNA
repair processes involving homologous recombination and genome integrity32. We therefore speculate that patients carrying
variants on these pathways might differently interact with the
virus, modulating a milder response to viral infection. Several identified processes offer druggable options for ther-
apeutic treatment. Androgen receptor signaling and its genetic variability have been already linked to COVID-19 severity11,33 and its inhibition proposed as a therapeutic strategy (e.g34.). We found several GPCR signaling instances significantly enriched in our
network, in particular those related to Gi and Gq signaling, which mediate vascular inflammation. In particular, the Gq pathway contributes to regulating calcium signaling, which is one of the
most enriched processes in our dataset and which leads to endothelial barrier disruption via adherens junction disassembly35. On
the other hand, Gq signaling might also contribute to transactivate JAK-STAT pathway via (ERK)1/2 signaling35, the latter in turn also activated by Gi signaling36. It has also been recently shown that the C5a-C5aR1 axis, which also signals intracellularly through Gq, plays a key role in the pathophysiology of ARDS associated with COVID-19 by starting and maintaining several inflammatory
responses through the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and monocytes37. Hence, similarly to what we and others previously described in cancer38, genetic factors converging on mod-
ulating common GPCR downstream signaling pathways might also contribute to the onset of the inflammatory response related to
COVID-19, at the same time offering new therapeutic intervention
options for patients with severe forms of COVID-19. The recent finding that autoantibodies targeting GPCRs are associated with COVID-19 severity39, further strengthens these receptors as ther-
apeutic candidates.
We found multiple, recurrent disease traits associated with the variants identified. The variants rs150021157 and rs140300753,
characterized by full support during supervised learning, also
provide an example of associations to phenotypes that might play a role in COVID-19 severity, such as "Abnormalities of breathing phenotype". Some categories show a prevalence of associations with risk factors, such as "respiratory or thoracic disease", including specific traits such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema or COPD (the latter also found in the "infectious disease" category).
Other categories enriched for associations with variants enriched in severe patients are "immune system disorders", including traits such as immunodeficiency with antibody defects, or "pancreas

disease", including several instances mainly associated to Type 2 diabetes, which is a known risk factor for severe COVID-1940 and whose molecular connection to cytokine storm inflammatory response has now begun to emerge17,41. Taken together, these results further corroborate our analysis.
Our model is complementary to previous and ongoing efforts entailing machine learning techniques (i.e. LASSO logistic regression models) and a boolean representation of genetic variants to identify the most informative features associated to severity to compile an Integrated PolyGenic Score for COVID-19 severity predictions17,18. While we expect that some of the variants identified in this study might be specific for the Italian population, we believe that our approach could be readily trained on different cohorts to identify additional biomarkers for patient stratification in the clinics. Our capability to understand and forecast the genetic factors contributing to COVID-19 disease severity will certainly benefit from the availability of larger sequencing cohorts, the usage of more advanced methods for case-control associations in WES studies, new methodological advancement in the explainable AI field, as well as on our prioror data-driven knowledge of biological mechanisms linking genetic variants to disease phenotypes.
Methods
Dataset and pre-processing. We used the whole-exome sequencing (WES) dataset of 1982 European descent patients collected from the GEN-COVID Multicenter Study group coordinated by the University of Siena (https://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/NCT04549831)14. Briefly, the GEN-COVID Multicenter Study includes a network of 22 Italian hospitals as well as local healthcare units and departments of preventative medicine (https://sites.google.com/dbm.unisi.it/gencovid). It started its activity on March 16, 2020, following approval by the Ethical Review Board of the Promoter Center, University of Siena (Protocol n. 16917, approval dated March 16, 2020). Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals who contributed samples and data. Detailed clinical and laboratory characteristics (data), specifically related to COVID-19, were collected for all subjects.
Specifically, the WES dataset contained a total of 1.057 M unique simple variants. Patients were classified according to the grading scheme by the World Health Organization (WHO). The grading classification contained the following categories: 0=not hospitalized (a- or pauci-symptomatic); 1=hospitalized without respiratory support; 2=hospitalized O2 supplementation; 3=hospitalized CPAPbiPAP; 4= hospitalized intubated; 5=dead. We considered patients from more severe groups, i.e. 3,4, and 5, as cases, and asymptomatic patients from group 0, as controls, for a total of 1078 patients. We further refined the grading classification based on an ordinal logistic model which uses age as input feature for sex-stratified patients17 and we retained only those patients whose grading classification was concordant with the one adjusted by age. This yielded a final set of 841 samples for downstream analysis.
Statistics and reproducibility. We employed the cohort of 841 patients to identify variants most associated to COVID-19 severity which we used, along with clinical co-variates such as age and sex, to train and test supervised binary classifiers of severity. We finally tested our ensemble of predictors on two unseen cohorts of patients: 618 individuals (122 asymptomatic, 496 severe), from a follow-up cohort of sequenced patients, and a set of 375 unique patients that were excluded from the original as well as the follow-up cohort due to inconsistencies between the original WHO grading classification and the one outputted by an ordinal logistic regression adjusted by age17.
We detail below the statistical procedure employed.
Stratified K-fold split of sample cohort into train and test sets. We embedded a strategy for variant screening into a stratified five fold cross-validation scheme (using the StratifiedKFold function from the scikit-learn library https://scikit-learn. org/) to generate 5 random training and testing set splits of the original dataset. Each fold was constituted by a training set, corresponding to 80% of the dataset, which was also employed for variant screening and a remaining 20% for the testing set. The variants in the test set were curated from the variants screened in the training set. Through the stratified fivefold approach, we made sure that all the samples of the dataset were employed for testing.
Variant screening. GATK best-practices for germline variant calling pipeline were employed, as described in our previous work aimed at characterizing common, low-frequency, rare, and ultra-rare coding variants contribute to COVID-19 severity17. We employed a Log-Odds Ratio (LOR) statistics calculated on a 2×2

contingency Data to perform case-control association and to screen variants associated with either severe or asymptomatic patients in each of the training sets for each of the five folds generated. We grouped severe patients from clinical groups 5, 4, and 3 which were contrasted against the asymptomatic ones, considered as controls (group 0). We defined a contingency Data to measure the enrichment of reference (Ref) or alternative (Alt) alleles in either severe or control groups by employing an additive model, whereby homozygous genotype (1/1) has twice the risk (or protection) of the heterozygous type (0/1 or 1/0). We employed the Data2x2 function from the statsmodels library (https://www.statsmodels.org/ sData/index.html) to calculate LORs values and associated p-values and confidence intervals from the the contingency Data in Fig. S8, respectively employing the functions log_oddsratio, log_oddsratio_pvalue() and log_oddsratio_confint(). We filtered variants with the following characteristics: p À value<0:05 and jLORj  1: Variants with LOR > 1 are enriched among severe, while those with LOR < -1 are enriched among asymptomatics.
Feature matrix generation. For each split, we generated a feature matrix for the training set by assigning the allele counts of each screened variant for each sample of the training: i.e. 0 for genotype 0/0, 1 for genotypes 1/0 or 0/1, 2 for genotype 1/1. The feature matrix for the test set was defined by considering only variants identified as significant after screening the training set of the corresponding split and by assigning the allele count of each sample of the test set. We also included as additional features age, which was normalized, and gender, which was binarized by setting males to 0 and females to 1. Severe patients from group "3 + 4 + 5" were given the classification label "1", the asymptomatic patients from group 0 were given the label "0".
Feature selection (removal of multicollinearity). We employed feature selection techniques to further reduce the number of considered features initially screened through the Log-Odds-Ratio statistics. We tried several approaches, including Lasso, ElasticNet and Multicollinearity, in combination with supervised training approaches (see below). After training several classifiers with the variants selected with each of these methods on a smaller cohort of 1200 samples, we found that removing multicollinearity from features by considering variant allele counts with correlation coefficients (corr.|0.8 | ) gave the best results. The screened features with little or no effects of multicollinearity formed the final 80% training sets in each fold and the final 20% corresponding validation sets used for training the supervised machine learning models.
Supervised binary classification. We trained supervised learning models for binary classification tasks by employing several algorithms, i.e. Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting classifiers, available within the scikit-learn python library (https://scikit-learn.org/).
Support Vector Classifier (SVC): a popular machine learning method that classifies data points utilizing the concept of hyper-plan and kernel tricks to find fits that best separate the data cloud. In this study, we used the popular Jupyter notebook and scikit-learn python package to import the "sklearn.svm" SVC classifier model. We first set the SVC default regularization parameter "C" to 1, the class weight to "balanced" in order to account for imbalanced classification problems in the dataset. The default linear kernel was used first with the prediction probability set to true. The GridSearchCV was used to select the best hyperparameter values for the estimator "C", "gamma", and the kernel (Linear, Radial Basis Function (RBF), and polynomial) that are critical to the performance of the SVC classifier. The best GridSearchCV estimator hyperparameter values that were used to train our dataset were identified as the RBF kernel, C = 10, and gamma set to 0.1.
Logistic Regression: a binary classification regression model that uses the logistic function to estimate the parameters of the logistic model. We import from the scikit-learn package the "sklearn.linear_model" the Logistic Regression model function. We first set the default logistic model classifier parameters; "class weight = balanced", C = 0.3 and solver = sag. The best GirdSearchCV estimator values used to train our dataset uses the regularization penalty of l1 (Lasso), C = 0.7, and solver = saga.
Random Forest (RF): an ensemble learning method that employs a bagging strategy. Multiple decision trees are trained using the same learning algorithm, and then predictions are aggregated from the individual decision tree. From the "sklearn.ensemble" library, we import the Random Forest Classifier function. The RF default model parameters use a class weight set to "balanced", maximum depth (max_depth) of the decision trees was set to 80, the number of features (max_features) was set to 2, minimum samples (min_samples_leaf) leaf of 3, minimum samples split (min_samples_split) of 10, and the number of trees (n_estimators) in the forest was set to 300. The GridSearchCV best model estimator parameters were "bootstrap = True", "max_depth" = 110, "max_features" = 2, "min_samples_leaf" = 5, "min_samples_split" = 10, and "n_estimators" = 100.
Extreme Gradient Boosted Trees classifier (XGBoost): an ensemble learning classifier family that utilizes boosting strategy to combine a set of weak learners and delivers improved prediction accuracy. We import from the XGBoost package "xgboost" library and xgboost function. We defined the data matrix (training feature set and classification label). We set the default XGBoost classifier model

parameters class weight to "balanced", learning objective to "binary logistic". The best GridSearchCV estimator parameters values we used to train the dataset were "learning_rate" = 0.01, "max_depth" = 3, "n_estimators" = 140.
In summary, for each of the four ML models, we performed a parameter optimization through grid search (GridSearchCV), using the accuracy_score during grid search as a scoring method. We performed a fivefolds cross-validation, by splitting 80% for training and 20% for validation in each fold, repeated three times, using the StratifiedKFold function with n_splits = 5 and n_repeats = 3. We also set the class weight parameter to "balanced" in each of the ML algorithms employed. Both model training and hyperparameters optimization was done with a Python Jupyter notebook interactive web-based development environment using the scikitlearn and the xgboost packages. Model performances on the testing set were evaluated through the following metrics: Accuracy, F1, Precision, Recall, Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC), AUCROC.
A consensus voting approach was used to aggregate validation prediction probability scores of the four ML algorithms (SVC, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers) from each of the (20%) testing sets from each fold by considering the median of the probability distribution collected from the ensemble of models. The features (variants) that received non-zero weight during training of the supervised ML methods (Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers) in each fold were combined across the fivefold for further interpretation.
We performed a randomization test (i.e. Salzberg's test) to assess over-fitting (Salzberg, 1997), where we replace the original phenotypic labels of the training matrix with randomly assigned labels while preserving the ratio of the number of positive (severe) and negative (asymptomatic) patients (Data S13).
Feature importance scores. The feature importance assigns weight scores to individual features that interact to predict a particular event in the model. Feature importance for RandomForest and XGBoost models were calculated as the mean decrease in impurity for the feature using the feature importances function from xgboost. The feature importance (weights) scores assigned from these models' predictions were aggregated across the fivefolds to prioritize variants according to their consensus importance across folds for further downstream analysis. In particular we defined the model support (ms) of a given variant as the fraction of tree-based models assigning non-zero feature importance during the training of the model.
Final testing on a follow-up cohort. We tested the best performing models trained using most supported variants with and without covariates on a followup cohort of sequenced, Italian patients. An initial set of 838 samples corresponding to grading groups 0, 3, 4 and 5 were refined by applying the same ordered logistic regression classification adjusted_by_age, which yielded a final set of 618 individuals (122 asymptomatic, 496 severe). We generated an additional testing test by considering all the samples that were previously excluded due to inconsistency between the original WHO grading classification and the one outputted by an ordinal logistic regression adjusted by age classifier17. In details, in the original cohort that we used for training the model, there were 237 samples from either asymptomatic (grading 0) or severe (grading 3 + 4 + 5) patients that were excluded due to classification inconsistencies, while in the follow-up cohort used for final testing of the model, 220 more individuals were excluded according to the same criteria. After removing patients with missing values, we obtained an aggregated list of 375 unique patients. We curated the allele counts of the 16 most informative variants, identified in the first stage of the analysis and model training, from this new set of patients and we used them, together with age and gender, as features for the testing. We evaluated the performances of the ensemble of the 20 models both on an individual as well as on an aggregated level, by calculating aggregated metrics obtained from the median of the probability distribution outputted by the ensemble of the 20 models on the testing samples.
Principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering. The variants with non-zero weights from best performing tree-based models were remapped back into the feature space to form a new feature count matrix covering 100% of the samples (i.e. 841 individuals). This reduced feature matrix was analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques to reduce the dimensional space. In order for us to do this, we utilized the "sklearn.decomposition" library to import the PCA function. We standardized the feature count matrix using the "sklearn.preprocessing" library to import the Standard Scaler function. We transformed the normal feature count matrix considering the 1st and 2nd PCA components. We further employ the K-means clustering technique (using the "sklearn.cluster" library to import the "KMeans" function) to visualize and cluster the 2D PCA components (1st and 2nd dimensions). We set the default cluster size to 3, the maximum iteration (max_iter=1000), and a tolerance value (tol=1E-04). Clusters of patients that express interesting severity patterns were further analyzed using the pathway enrichment for biological interpretations and implications.
Pathway enrichment analysis. The pathway enrichment analysis was done using the ReactomeFIViz plugin42 available in Cytoscape43. The genes corresponding to variants with non-zero feature importance from XGBoost were used to construct a Functional Interaction (FI) network. The general FI network comprised all the genes affected by variants with non-zero feature importances in both patient

groups. Node diameter is proportional to the number of variants with non-zero coefficients in any tree-based models. Node color is instead proportional to the LOR with the highest absolute value among the variants associated with a given gene. Modules within the network were identified through spectral partition clustering44. Reactome pathways over-representation analysis (FDR<0.1) was calculated on either the whole network or for each individual module. We also generated group-specific networks by keeping separated genes with variants enriched in severity from those enriched in asymptomatic and performed pathway over-representation analysis (FDR < 0.1) on the distinct networks.
Retrieving associations between variants and disease traits or phenotypes. We retrieved associations among the variants identified in our study and disease traits or phenotypes through the Open Targets Genetics platform21. We interrogated the database using the GraphQL query language embedded in a python script and by inputting the variant coordinates (given by chromosome nr, position, Ref, and Alt allele). For each PheWAS association, we retrieved the following data: eaf, beta, se, nTotal, nCases, oddsRatio, studyId and pval. Only PheWAS with oddsRatio > 1 and p val <0.001 were considered. The statistics were done only for the variants with non-zero feature importance from XGBoost models.
All the analyses were performed using customized Python (v3.8) scripts, with the following libraries: scipy (v1.2.0), numpy (v1.19.4), scikit-learn (v0.23.2.), statsmodels (v0.11.0) and matplotlib (v3.2.1).

recorded either serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) concentration (nmol/L) or estimated Vitamin D intake from interviews/food diaries.
Additionally, Vitamin D data was rarely collected in lowincome countries such as Africa. Data mapping has outlined disease reporting standards in countries and has emphasised the systematic differences between healthcare systems. Conclusion Vitamin D data can be combined with COVID19 incidence and mortality data, to explore the relationship between Vitamin D and COVID-19. Further research can explore inter-individual differences in Vitamin D requirements, optimal therapeutic doses required and how individual requirements can be determined. Findings will improve disease pathway understanding, support the generation of aetiological hypotheses and contribute to COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Substandard diagnosis and reporting in low-middle income countries underestimates disease rates, compared to high income countries. Studies investigating countries across income levels may therefore be affected by case-ascertainment bias, however also highlight where future resources should be directed to improve overall health and reduce inequalities, as well as reducing the burden of COVID-19.

Background The world witnessed a dramatic disruption in our daily lives due to COVID-19 pandemic and Bangladesh is no exception. Such kind of public health crisis instigated by pandemics & its repercussion can elicit significant negative emotions, in line with stress, changed dietary patterns and weakened immune system. All these are inter-linked. As there were merely such studies in Bangladesh, this study aimed to find out association between dietary patterns and perceived stress level of urban adults during COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives This study intended to find out the association between dietary patterns and perceived stress level among adults in Bangladesh as well as their dietary patterns and perceived stress level during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A Cross-sectional study was conducted among 300 adults (aged 18 years) of three urban communities in Dhaka city of Bangladesh from February 2021 to June 2021. A semistructured questionnaire using purposive convenience sampling based on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and minimum dietary diversity for individual adult, 24 hours recall by face to face interviews ensuring proper protective precautions. Measures included baseline and personal characteristics, perceived stress levels, dietary patterns. Data were analyzed by using latest SPSS software. Results The results showed moderate level of perceived stress among majority of the population with approximate one-in ten (12.0%) and one-fourths (22.0%) of the respondents with a low and high level of stress, respectively. It also revealed the association of perceived stress level with several sociodemographic factors such as age group (p<0.026), employment status (p<0.001), monthly income (p<0.044) and sleep quality (p<0.001). Significant association between dietary patterns (egg consumption) and perceived stress level (p<0.036) was identified which is distinguishable to reliance on availability & affordability of the source. Those having poor sleep quality were more likely to get stress and changed dietary patterns (AOR=2.147; 95% CI: 1.153-3.997; p=0.00). Conclusions As higher stress level is associated with less healthy eating behavior and dietary patterns leading to poor nutritional status, proper evidential reasoning can go a long way to emphasize the concern. It will be a prolific initiative if policymakers merge nutrition-related public health interventions along with stress management programs through multisectoral collaboration.

Background Nowadays, dietitians widely use social media tools such as Instagram in order to build their clientele as well as share healthy eating tips and recipes. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the nutritional content of recipes shared by dietitians on Instagram. Methods Instagram accounts of Turkish dietitians who had a blue tick (known as the Instagram verified sticker) in their account and more than 100,000 followers were included. We determined the last 10 Instagram recipe posts of each dietitian and divided them into 7 categories according to their content: main dish, soup, healthy bakery products, breakfast, salads,

Intercurrent infections (major and minor) were associated with the occurrence of SLE flares (major and minor; HR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.9) (Figure 1). The hazard ratio for a major SLE flare following a major infection was 7.4 (95% CI 2.2- 24.6). Major infections were not associated with the occurrence of minor flares. Conclusions The results of the present study confirm a high frequency of infections in SLE patients and suggest that intercurrent infection is a risk factor for SLE flares. These findings underline the importance of prevention and treatment of infections in SLE patients and create awareness of infections as potential triggers of SLE flares.

Introduction In the era of COVID-19 pandemic, data on safety and efficacy of anti-COVID vaccines in SLE patients is needed and scarce. Belimumab is a monoclonal antibody directed at BAFF, an essential cytokine in B cell survival, though it does not impair efficacy of some traditional vaccines. Thus, the aim of our study was to assess immunogenicity and safety of BNT162b2 Pfizer mRNA vaccine in SLE patients treated with Belimumab. Methods SLE patients treated with Belimumab for at least 6 months in the Sheba Medical Center were included in this study. All were recommended to receive the BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine according to Ministry of Health recommendations, and thereafter to perform a serologic test for CoV-2 IgG 2-6 weeks after receiving the 2nd or 3rd doses. Clinical data included demographics, SLE treatments, adverse effects to the vaccine as well as SLEDAI scores performed 2 weeks before receiving 1st dose and 6 to 8 weeks after receiving 2nd and 3rd doses of the vaccine. Results Our cohort included 17 patients, 15(88.2%) were females, median age was 50±14.2 years, and disease duration was 12±10.57 years. Median Belimumab treatment time was 6±2.5 years. In our cohort 2/17 received only 2 vaccine doses as thereafter the suffered mild COVID-19 infection, while 15/ 17 patients received 3-doses. Serologic assessment was performed for 10 patients, 7/10(70%) became seropositive following the second dose, while 2/3 patients seroconverted only after the 3rd dose. Vaccination was well tolerated with minimal adverse events and no disease flares (e,g. SLEDAI 7.7 ±5.19 and 7.82±5.2 before vaccination and post 3rd dose respectively). Conclusions Immunization with 3 doses of BNT vaccine is safe and efficacious for SLE patients treated with Belimumab. Only following the 3rd dose immunogenicity of SLE patients in this cohort mounted to 90%, thereby approximating the

Aims To fully characterise B-cell and T-cell immune responses elicited by mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with rheumatic diseases under immunotherapies, and to identify which drugs reduce vaccine's immunogenicity. Methods Humoral, CD4 and CD8 immune responses were investigated in 100 naïve patients with SARS-CoV-2 with selected rheumatic diseases under immunosuppression after a two-dose regimen of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. Responses were compared with age, gender and disease-matched patients with IMRD not receiving immunosuppressors and with healthy controls. Results Patients with IMRD showed decreased seroconversion rates (80% vs 100%, p=0.03) and cellular immune responses (75% vs 100%, p=0.02). Patients on methotrexate achieved seroconversion in 62% of cases and cellular responses in 80% of cases. Abatacept decreased humoral and cellular responses. Rituximab (31% responders) and belimumab (50% responders) showed impaired humoral responses, but cellular responses were often preserved. Antibody titres were reduced with mycophenolate and azathioprine but preserved with leflunomide and anticytokines.
Abstract PO.8.169 Table 1 Multivariant analysis
Conclusions Patients with IMRD exhibit impaired SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunogenicity, variably reduced with immunosuppressors. Among commonly used therapies, abatacept and Bcell depleting therapies show deleterious effects, while anticytokines preserved immunogenicity. The effects of cumulative methotrexate and glucocorticoid doses on immunogenicity should be considered. Humoral and cellular responses are weakly correlated, but CD4 and CD8 tightly correlate. Seroconversion alone might not reflect the vaccine's immunogenicity.

ABSTRACT
Introduction: Injected mRNA vaccines have been proven effective and safe in the SARS-CoV-2 pan­ demic. Using the machinery of the cell, mRNA vaccines translate into an antigen, which triggers an adaptive immune response. The effectiveness of intramuscular administered mRNA vaccines wanes in the months post-vaccination, which makes frequent booster administrations necessary. To make booster administration easier and increase efficacy, pulmonary administration could be investigated. The aim of this literature study was therefore to review the published preclinical (animal) studies on the safety and efficacy of pulmonary administered mRNA vaccines. Areas covered: We first provide background information on mRNA vaccines and immunological mechanisms of vaccination. Thereafter, we provide an evaluation of published animal studies, in which mRNA vaccines (or mRNA containing nanoparticles) were delivered into the lungs. We covered the following areas: biodistribution, cellular uptake, immune response, protection, and safety. All relevant papers were found using PubMed/MEDLINE database. Expert opinion: In our opinion, head-to-head comparison studies examining the safety and efficacy of intramuscular injected and pulmonary administered liquid mRNA vaccines should be performed first. When pulmonary delivered mRNA vaccines are shown to be effective and safe, inhalable dry powder formulations should be engineered. Finally, the tolerability of patients with respiratory diseases should be considered.

1. Introduction
mRNA vaccines are of increased interest in the scientific world, predominantly caused by recent developments in the SARSCoV-2 pandemic. This pandemic has transformed the oncedismissed concept of mRNA vaccines into a powerful platform for eliciting potent immune responses. Unlike traditional vac­ cines, such as live-attenuated and inactivated organisms, or purified products derived from them, mRNA vaccines provide our cells with instructions on how to synthesize a specific protein - or in some cases a small part of a protein - to trigger an adaptive immune response [1-3]. To facilitate uptake by cells, mRNA is often formulated into ionizable lipid nanoparti­ cles (LNPs). This technology has been successfully implemen­ ted by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, resulting in the well tolerated and highly efficacious mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively [1,2]. These vaccines have been shown to reduce hospitalization rates by more than 90% upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.7 variant) in people who received two doses via intramuscular injection [4-6]. The pro­ tection conferred by these vaccines, however, has been shown to wane in the months following vaccination, even in indivi­ duals that received three doses [7-9]. The waning immunity is caused by a reduced immune response or by the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) display significantly dif­ ferent antigens than the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain that is used for the mRNA vaccines, but most likely both reasons play a role

[10-12]. The need for frequent booster injections is a burden to the health system and individual patient. In addition, the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains fairly high [13,14]. These findings highlight the importance of further considering strategies for improving the efficacy of mRNA vaccines, for instance, by looking into alternative administra­ tion routes (e.g. pulmonary, intramucosal, intradermal).
To improve the vaccine's efficacy, it could be beneficial to use the same route of administration for the vaccine as the natural route of infection. Administering mRNA vaccines against airborne transmitted viruses via the pulmonary route, for instance, would eliminate the use of needles as well as the risk of needle-stick injuries and requirements for trained healthcare personnel [15]. Moreover, it is a lower burden to the vaccinee. The most important advantage of pulmonary administration, however, lies in the fact that this route not only produces a systemic immune response (e.g. IgG produc­ tion), as is the case after intramuscular injection, but also a local mucosal immune response (e.g. IgA production) [15- 17]. Intramuscular administration of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vac­ cines has shown to increase serum IgA levels as well, yet serum IgA peak levels were lower and declined more rapidly than serum IgG levels [18-20]. Furthermore, it has been shown that after SARS-CoV-2 infection secretory IgA levels in the mucosa persist longer and are more potent than serum IgA levels [18,20]. IgA responses are of particular interest since it

Article highlights
 mRNA vaccines have been successfully used to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
 Current SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines require frequent administration of booster injections, which may be easier when given via the pulmonary route.
 To further improve the protection against respiratory infections, the vaccines could be delivered at the entry portal of the pathogen: the lung mucosa.
 Reviewed studies have shown that mRNA vaccines administered via the pulmonary route elicit humoral and cellular immune responses.
 Future studies should further characterize immunological responses and safety aspects, and work toward inhalable formulations that are well tolerated also by patients suffering from lung diseases.
has been shown that IgA leads to cross-protection after influ­ enza infection or pulmonary vaccination with an influenza vaccine in both mice and human [21-26]. Therefore, the mucosal response has been postulated to improve the efficacy of vaccines [27-29]. The value of administering vaccines via the pulmonary route has been elegantly demonstrated by Tomar et al. [30]. In this study, the authors compared intra­ muscular injection to pulmonary administration in BALB/c mice and found the former approach yielded only IgG titers, whereas administration via the pulmonary route generated IgG and IgA titers [30]. This effect was observed for both influenza and hepatitis B vaccines, meaning immune responses are orchestrated not only against airborne infec­ tious diseases but also those spread via the blood or body fluids. Administering mRNA vaccines via the pulmonary route therefore seems highly attractive.
Already more than 50 years ago, the efficacy of pulmon­ ary administered influenza whole inactivated virus vaccine was demonstrated in humans [31]. In the past decade, several studies have been published in which pulmonary administration of mRNA-containing nanoparticles was eval­ uated in laboratory animals [32-53]. Some of those were focused on characterizing cell uptake and biodistribution, whereas others focused on analyzing immunological effects and safety. Only few studies examined mRNA used as a vaccine. We therefore decided to include studies focusing on mRNA vaccines, mRNA nanoparticles to increase protein levels or nanoparticles containing model mRNA as well. At this point, it is not entirely clear whether the pulmonary delivery route is suitable for the administration of mRNA vaccines, as the current state of knowledge has not been adequately reviewed yet. The aim of this literature study was therefore to investigate whether administration of mRNA vaccines via the pulmonary route is safe and effective based on published animal studies. In this review, we first provide background information on mRNA vaccines as well as immunological mechanisms of vaccination. We then dis­ cuss the published animal studies in terms of biodistribu­ tion, cell uptake, immunological effects, and safety. The review will end with our expert opinion, describing our interpretation of the data and vision for the future: a future that looks beyond intramuscular injection as a goto method for administering mRNA vaccines.

2. mRNA vaccines
mRNA vaccines contain mRNA strands, encoding a diseasespecific antigen, formulated into nanoparticles [54]. Constructing the mRNA sequence represents the first step in vaccine development and requires special consideration. The mRNA is constructed using in vitro transcription (IVT). IVT is a process where the promoter of synthesized DNA is recog­ nized by a polymerase that produces multiple copies of the mRNA. The synthesized DNA is optimized by flanking the open reading frame (ORF) with untranslated regions (UTRs) and adding a poly-A tail at the 3' end to allow for efficient transla­ tion and stabilization [3,54-60]. Following transcription, the mRNA is purified and additional modifications are added, e.g. a 5' cap [55,56]. Other modifications are made to enhance the potency of mRNA vaccines, e.g. the substitution of base pairs reduces the activation of endosomal RNA-sensing proteins, such as toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 [56,58,59,61]. Uridine, for example, is often replaced by 1-methylpsuedouridine (m1), as the latter avoids activation of the antiviral immune response that leads to translational suppression in cells and, by extension, strongly reduced cellular and humoral immunity [54,59,61-63]. These mRNA modifications enable efficient anti­ gen expression.
The internalization of mRNA into cells requires nanopar­ ticles [64-66]. Using nanoparticles is crucial, as mRNA can­ not readily pass cell membranes due to its relatively large size and negative charge [54,64]. On top of that, nanoparti­ cles protect the single-stranded mRNA molecules from degradation by circulating nucleases. In the past decades, a myriad of (platform) technologies have been developed, often exploiting the unique properties of polymers, pep­ tides, or lipids [17,67,68]. The use of polymers, which may be synthetic (e.g. polyethylenimine (PEI)) or originate from natural sources (e.g. chitosan), was immensely popular in the past, but has slowly started giving way to lipid-based nanoparticles. This shift was caused by the increased avail­ ability of lipid nanoparticle technologies that have more desirable safety profiles. Due to these advantages and the fact that LNPs are used in the FDA-approved vaccines, they will be discussed in more detail [69]. Details about polymerbased and peptide-based nanoparticles are described else­ where [60,67,68,70]. LNPs represent the most advanced, clinically available technology. Formerly, positively charged LNPs were used, while recently neutral LNPs are more com­ mon [71]. LNPs are composed of various types of phospho­ lipids, such as ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids [54,60,64,69,72]. Each of these lipids serves an important role. In physiological con­ ditions, LNPs are neutral, but upon uptake into endosomes, the ionizable lipids on the surface become charged, leading to endosomal disruption and release of mRNA into the cytosol [64]. The other lipids are used for stabilization pur­ poses and for controlling the size of nanoparticles. LNPs have also been shown to be exceptionally safe since low inflammation levels and a good tolerability have been shown in rats and monkeys and a low reactogenicity has been shown in human after intramuscular injection of LNPs [1,2,73,74].

Upon intramuscular injection, mRNA-containing nanoparticles are taken up by cells located near the injection site and by cells located in distal tissues (e.g. lymph nodes and liver) [75,76]. Cells capable of internalizing mRNA vaccines include not only antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells and macrophages, but also other nucleated cells, such as endothelial and epithelial cells [3]. Following endocytosis, endosomal escape of the mRNA into the cytosol is facilitated by the nanoparticle [3,61]. The mRNA is subsequently translated by ribosomes, resulting in the produc­ tion of antigen [3,61]. BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, for example, produce full-length spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and BNT162b1 encodes for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) [1,2,77]. Antigens in the cytosol are then degraded into smaller fragments by means of proteasomal degradation, after which the fragments are presented on the surface of cells by major histo­ compatibility complex (MHC)-1 proteins [3,77]. This route is avail­ able to APCs and all other nucleated cells. The antigen can also be excreted by, e.g., APCs to be consequently taken up again by APCs. In this case, the antigen is degraded into fragments through lysosomal degradation, and the resulting fragments are expressed on the surface of APCs by MHC-2 [3]. Since the mRNA is genetically modified to make it more stable, the mRNA can stay in the cytosol and produce the antigen for a few days before it is degraded [38].
3. Immunological mechanisms of vaccination
Once APCs, in particular, dendritic cells, have finished processing antigens and are expressing peptide fragments on their surface via MHC proteins, they migrate toward the draining lymph nodes via the afferent lymph vessels [3]. In the lymph nodes, APCs interact with naive lymphocytes that bear receptors capable of recognizing specific peptide fragment, a process called clonal selection. Only

a small fraction of these lymphocytes have receptors highly spe­ cific for the antigen. These cells then proliferate and differentiate, resulting in the production of effector cells. This step is called clonal expansion [3]. This process gives rise to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which are able to kill infected cells, and CD4+ T helper cells, which help B cells to become antibody-producing plasma cells [78]. This represents the cellular component of the adaptive immune response [78]. The humoral component involves the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies by plasma cells. Selected lympho­ cytes are also transported to `infected' tissue via efferent lymph nodes and blood. Some of the lymphocytes persist in the body, providing long-term immunological memory of pathogens or parts of a pathogen [3,61]. The length of protection varies; in case of SARS-CoV-2, it may be fairly short-lived (<6 months) espe­ cially when new VoCs emerge [7,12,79].
The lymphoid system plays an important role in orchestrating adaptive immune responses to pathogens. It is therefore not surprising that the route of administration for vaccines affects the extent to which such responses develop. Unlike intramuscular injection, pulmonary administration of vaccines against airborne transmitted viruses leads to the formation of inducible bronchusassociated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) [16,80-82]. iBALT represents a tertiary lymphoid structure, containing B cells and plasma cells as well as T cells and APCs, and is an effective priming site for mucosal immune responses [16,80-82]. The immune responses
initiated in iBALT are slower than those in the lymph nodes, as
iBALT formation takes some time. Still, iBALT is able to process
antigens, neutralize pathogens by producing IgG and IgA antibo­
dies, and react quickly upon secondary infections (Figure 1)
[16,80,81]. This system also contributes to a broader humoral
immune response upon infection or vaccination compared to
the systemic immune response. Where the systemic immune

response mainly triggers the production of IgG and to a lesser extent IgA, the mucosal immune system triggers the production of high levels of IgG as well as (local) IgA [16]. IgA, produced by the mucosal tissue, serves an important function because it neutralizes pathogens and prevents them from binding to mucosal tissue [16,83-86].
Once infections have been cleared, or when the primary adaptive immune response has passed, effector lymphocytes and antibodies have accumulated at the infected site, or the site of injection for vaccines [63,78]. This offers protection against the same pathogen in the short term. Long-term protection is offered by memory B and T lymphocytes, which persist to afford protective immunity upon re-encountering a specific pathogen, or a small part of it [61,63,78,83]. In case of re-exposure, a secondary adaptive immune response is initiated [63,83]. This response is considerably stronger and faster than the primary response. In fact, successive exposure to a particular antigen leads to even more pronounced responses [63,83]. The resulting antibodies typically have an improved binding affinity for the respective targets [63]. BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, for instance, require two doses to generate sufficient cellular and humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and for some individuals three doses are recom­ mended [1,2,9,87,88]. Memory cells are therefore essential. The maintenance of these cell populations, be it within the lym­ phoid system or mucosal surfaces, does not require the pre­ sence of the original antigen; memory cells persist as long as they are exposed to pro-survival cytokines, such as IL-7 and IL15 [89]. Accordingly, pulmonary vaccination seems promising.
4. Animal studies
We studied whether pulmonary administration of mRNA vac­ cines is a safe and efficacious alternative to intramuscular injection. To do so, we reviewed published animal studies, as clinical data is lacking. Studies were identified using the PubMed/MEDLINE database. We identified 22 publications, 6 of which explored immunological effects, 12 characterized the effects of model mRNA, and 8 focused on using mRNAcontaining nanoparticles for restoring protein levels (Figure 2A). In all studies, the mRNA has been pulmonary administered in liquid formulations, except for one study,

where mRNA was administered as dry powder formulation [49]. Even if there is no specific focus on vaccination and protection, studies in which mRNA nanoparticles have been administered pulmonary can still provide valuable informa­ tion, e.g. when it comes to biodistribution, cellular uptake, immunogenicity, protein expression, and safety (Figure 2B). Although the number of publications about pulmonary admi­ nistered mRNA is not high yet, the interest has risen over the years (Figure 2C). The characteristics of each study are sum­ marized in Table 1.
4.1. Biodistribution
The first step of pulmonary vaccination is the administration of the formulation to the airways. We therefore first explored biodistribu­ tion profiles, as the deposition site has been shown to affect adaptive immune responses [30]. In one of the earlier reports, Su et al. [41] showed that intranasally administered mRNA-containing nanoparticles stay in the nasal cavity until 12 h after administration (Figure 3A). Lung deposition, however, remained limited. A few years later, Phau et al. and Li et al. reported similar findings: high expression levels of luciferase were detected in the nasal cavity only [34,51]. Limited lung deposition was mostly observed due to the fact that the authors administered too low volumes (i.e. one dose of 15-20 µL per nostril). Larger volumes and repeated intra­ nasal administrations (e.g. two doses of 20 µL) do lead to a fairly uniform deposition of nanoparticles containing mRNA throughout the lungs, as was shown by Robinson et al. [46].
Besides the volume, the device used to deliver the nanoparti­ cles containing mRNA to the lungs is relevant. With microsprayers and nebulizers, a large volume can be inhaled (50-100 µL), which ensures that the mRNA-containing nanoparticles reach the periph­ eral airways [33,36,38,40,47]. Patel et al. [36], for example, used a nebulizer to administer the mRNA nanoparticles pulmonary and showed that mRNA is distributed throughout every lobe (Figure 3B,C). Immunofluorescent staining showed that mRNAcontaining nanoparticles administered pulmonary using a microsprayer or nebulizer are evenly distributed throughout the lungs, as was shown by Tiwari et al. [40] and Lokugamage et al. [47] (Figure 3D). Two publications described that they deliv­ ered the mRNA nanoparticles intratracheally, via instillation or spraying [45,48]. Using these techniques, the mRNA-containing

nanoparticles reached the deeper lungs as well [45,48]. The deposi­ tion site of pulmonary delivered mRNA vaccines should be exam­ ined in detail because it is known that the ideal deposition site of a vaccine differs per disease [30]. Since lung tissue is vulnerable, a delicate, but potent immune response is desired minimizing adverse effects.
The mRNA nanoparticles should have a sufficient residence time in the nasal cavity or lungs since the mRNA needs time to be taken up by the cells and produce the antigen. The residence time is influenced by the type of nanoparticle. For example, Li et al. [34] showed that the fluorescent signal of mRNA-containing PEI nanoparticles in the nasal cavity decays within 1 h and the signal was significantly lower than that of cyclodextrin-PEI (CP2k) nano­ particles. Besides the residence time, the transfection efficiency is determined by the type of nanoparticle as well. Patel et al. [36] showed that mRNA encapsulated in a PEI nanoparticle is translated into significantly less protein than mRNA-containing hDD90-118 nanoparticles. Lipid nanoparticles are suggested to have an opti­ mal protein production, as was shown by Van Hoecke et al. [48]

and Pardi et al. [38]. They both showed a high protein concentra­ tion that peaked 24 h after pulmonary administration and after 48 h, no protein was measured in the lungs anymore. Taken together, these studies highlight the importance of using ade­ quate techniques for achieving lung deposition of mRNA vaccines and the need to use deposition profiles or formulations that have a sufficiently long residence time in the airways to be taken up by the cells and produce a sufficient amount of antigen.
4.2. Cellular uptake
Once mRNA-containing nanoparticles are delivered into the airways, they should be internalized by cells in order to initiate protein production. It is not fully known, however, by which mechanism and by which cells nanoparticles are internalized. The proposed uptake mechanism of nanoparticles is endocy­ tosis and pinocytosis, as shown in cell cultures [90,91]. We expect that these uptake mechanisms ensure cellular uptake of mRNA nanoparticles following pulmonary administration as

well, although this has not been investigated yet. We there­ fore analyzed studies to collect more information about this issue. The first study to assess cell uptake was conducted by Lorenzi et al. [32], who prepared naked mRNA encoding for Hsp65 in an attempt to protect mice from tuberculosis. Using flow cytometry, the authors found that the nanoparticles were taken up mostly by dendritic cells, while uptake by macro­ phages and B cells was marginal. Two years later, Andries et al. [35] reported that mRNA-containing GL67/DOPE/DMPEPEG5000 nanoparticles were mainly taken up by APCs in mice via phagocytosis, as the authors observed increased expression levels of IL-12, which is produced by APCs in response to antigenic stimulation. Interestingly, Van Hoecke et al. [48] showed that DOPAP/cholesterol nanoparticles con­ taining mRNA were predominantly taken up by alveolar macrophages, and to a lesser extent by dendritic cells. These observations were corroborated by Hajam et al. [44], who found that macrophages were responsible for the uptake of empty chitosan nanoparticles in chickens. Unfortunately, the authors did not examine the uptake of nanoparticles contain­ ing mRNA.
Although it seems as if only APCs take up nanoparticles, evidence suggests that they can also be internalized by non­ immune cells. Patel et al. [36], for example, used flow cytome­ try to reveal that epithelial as well as endothelial cells took up poly(beta-aminoester) (PBAE) nanoparticles containing lucifer­ ase mRNA. This might be related to differences in the materi­ als that the particles are made of. APCs probably take up nanoparticles in a relatively nonspecific manner, whereas for other cell types it may depend on the material. Similarly, Li et al. showed that mRNA encapsulated in CP2k nanoparticles were taken up by nasal epithelial cells and nasal associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) [34]. However, it is not clear whether these mRNA-CP2k nanoparticles ended up in the lungs as well [34]. Extensive uptake by a large number of cell types was demonstrated by Mays et al. [43], who administered naked mRNA encoding for Foxp3 in an attempt to treat allergic asthma. The authors found that the mRNA was taken up by eosinophils, CD4+ T cells, alveolar macrophages, and alveolar type II cells as well as neutrophils and lymphocytes, albeit to a lesser extent [43]. These findings are remarkable, considering the fact that the uptake of naked mRNA was shown to be negligible in vitro, owing to its large size and negative charge as well as susceptibility to nucleases [54,64]. Collectively, how­ ever, these studies do indicate that nanoparticles, when admi­ nistered via the pulmonary route, are mostly internalized by APCs, which is not surprising as they are known to have a tremendous phagocytotic capacity [92].
4.3. Immunogenicity
Cellular uptake of mRNA vaccines should be followed by protein expression inducing a potent immune response. We therefore took a closer look at studies that characterized humoral and cellular responses as well as the extent of pro­ tection conferred by pulmonary vaccination. Six published animal studies presented data on humoral and/or cellular responses, of which three also conducted challenge experi­ ments (Table 2). In each study, mRNA vaccines were delivered

to either the nasal cavity or the lung via intranasal adminis­ tration, using sufficient volumes, or intratracheal instillation.
4.3.1. Humoral immune response The humoral, or antibody, immune response is essential for neutralizing foreign material, preventing the attachment of pathogens to host cells and marking the pathogen for destruction [3,93]. The first study that reported data on IgA and IgG titers was carried out by Li et al. [34]. In this study, intranasal administration of mRNA vaccines encoding for gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in mice was shown to increase IgG and IgA titers in the cervix and nasal tissue. The authors also confirmed the importance of incorpor­ ating mRNA into a nanoparticle, as this contributed to signifi­ cantly higher levels of IgG and IgA than naked mRNA. Moreover, the type of nanoparticle affected IgA and, to a lesser extent, IgG levels. Nanoparticles prepared from PEI yielded lower antibody titers than those made of CP2k. The cause of this difference is not fully understood, but it could be caused by intrinsic toxicity of PEI, leading to the death of cells that take up nanoparticles (e.g. APCs) or variations on uptake efficiency between the different nanoparticles [36,94]. Unfortunately, Li et al. [34] did not challenge mice with HIV after vaccination, and it is therefore not known whether pro­ tection was conferred. Follow-up work by Li et al. described similar results [53]. In this case, the authors treated mice with a mRNA vaccine encoding for ovalbumin. The nanoparticles were made from PEI or CP2k, the latter of which proved to produce superior levels of vaginal IgA and IgG. It remains unclear, however, whether antibody levels in the pulmonary mucosa follow the same pattern. As the authors used mRNA encoding ovalbumin, protection was not considered.
Later, Hajam et al. [44] studied IgA production in lung mucosa of chickens after pulmonary vaccination using either empty chitosan nanoparticles, chitosan nanoparticles with influenza HA2 and M2E proteins, or chitosan nanoparticles with influenza HA2 and M2E proteins and mRNA encoding for these proteins. The addition of mRNA to the nanoparticles resulted in higher IgA levels than those containing only pro­ tein. This effect was not observed for IgG titers. These authors also challenged the vaccinated chickens with live influenza virus. Chickens that received both protein and mRNAcontaining nanoparticles had significantly higher levels of virus-neutralizing titers than those receiving only proteincontaining nanoparticles. Unfortunately, head-to-head com­ parisons between intramuscular injections and pulmonary administration are very limited. In fact, the only study known to have done so was carried out by Anderluzzi et al. [50], who examined pulmonary delivered mRNA encoding for rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) encapsulated in four different lipid nanoparticles in mice (Table 2). While the four types of lipid nanoparticles only slightly differed in their lipid composition, their anti-RVG IgG responses differed significantly when admi­ nistered intramuscularly. No humoral response was shown after pulmonary vaccination since the mRNA vaccine was swallowed and did not reach the lungs. It is suggested that throat deposition occurred upon intranasal administration of the vaccine, followed by mucociliary clearance, resulting in swallowing of the mRNA nanoparticles. In conclusion, these

studies showed that pulmonary administration leads to increased IgA and IgG titers. However, it remains to be seen to what extent such levels provide protection relative to the protection achieved after intramuscular administration.
4.3.2. Cellular immune response Several studies examined whether pulmonary administered mRNA vaccines induced a cellular immune response (Table 2). The first study examining the T-cell response after pulmonary mRNA vaccination was conducted by Phau et al. [52]. These researchers studied whether mRNA vaccines induced an anti-tumor immune response. After intranasal vac­ cination, CD8 + T-cells were found in the spleen of mice vaccinated with mRNA nanoparticles, but this was not the case for naked mRNA. This suggests that the produced anti­ gen is only able to trigger a CD8 + T-cell anti-tumor response when the mRNA is encapsulated in a nanoparticle, ensuring efficient transfection. It was not studied, however, whether memory cells were formed. In two follow-up studies by Li et al. [34,53] it was shown that the cellular immune response depends on the type of nanoparticle used. The CD8+ and CD4 + T-cell responses after vaccination with a CP2k nanoparticle were significantly higher than after vaccination with a PEI nanoparticle, CP600 nanoparticle, and naked mRNA [34,53]. Mai et al. [49] also showed that the carrier influences the cellular immune response. In this study, the authors adminis­ tered an mRNA vaccine encoding for CK19, using cationic liposome/protamine complexes. These particles showed higher levels of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells than nanoparticles made from either solely liposomes or protamine. In the same year, Hajam et al. [44] showed that pulmonary adminis­ tration of chitosan nanoparticles with influenza HA2 and M2E protein and mRNA encoding for these proteins led to an

increase of CD4+ T-cells and a moderate increase of CD8 + T-cells.
None of these studies, however, made direct comparisons between pulmonary administration and intramuscular injec­ tion. To determine whether lung delivery of mRNA results in a different immune response than intramuscular injection, both administration routes should be considered. So far, only Anderluzzi et al. [50] examined the cellular immune response after either intramuscular or pulmonary administration of a mRNA vaccine to mice. Similar to the humoral immune response, the lipid composition of the nanoparticles deter­ mined the cellular immune response after intramuscular administration. The cellular immune response after pulmonary administration could not be determined since the vaccine was swallowed and did not reach the lungs. In conclusion, these studies showed that pulmonary administration of mRNA vac­ cines leads to increased levels of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells. However, it remains unclear how these levels compare to the levels obtained after intramuscular administration.
4.3.3. Protection The purpose of an mRNA vaccine is to provide protection. Hajam et al. [44] showed that chickens pulmonary vaccinated with chitosan nanoparticles with influenza HA2 and M2E pro­ tein and mRNA or nanoparticles containing solely the HA2 and M2E proteins had a low viral load and their lung histology showed no signs of inflammation after influenza challenge. The chickens vaccinated with empty chitosan nanoparticles showed a high viral load and inflammation in their lungs after influenza challenge. Protection has also been seen for pulmonary delivered naked mRNA that does not act as a vaccine but encodes for an anti-pathogen protein. An increased life span and a normal lung histology were shown

Histology of lungs of mice after inhaling three doses of bPEI and hDD90-118 nanoparticles containing mRNA at day 8. The architecture of the alveoli is maintained in lungs of mice receiving either bPEI or hDD90-118 nanoparticles. Lungs exposed to bPEI do show red blood cells. Alveolar macrophages are present in the lungs and the bronchiolar architecture is maintained after receiving either bPEI or hDD90-118 nanoparticles. B. Study of Qiu et al. [33]. The lungs of untreated mice appeared healthy. Lungs of mice intratracheally treated with 10 µg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed an irregular distribution of the air spaces and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the alveolar and interstitial spaces was observed. Lungs of mice treated with mRNA PEG12KL4 nanoparticles did not show inflammation.

when mice were challenged with a disease post-mRNA treat­ ment, while mice not receiving the mRNA treatment experi­ enced a shorter life span and severe inflammation in their lungs after disease challenge [32,42,43]. mRNA-containing nanoparticles can also produce anti-pathogen proteins. Lokugamage et al. [47] and Van Hoecke et al. [48] showed that mice pulmonary receiving nanoparticles containing mRNA encoding for proteins important during influenza infec­ tion (i.e. FcRIV VHH-M2e VHH and aFI6) first lost weight after a challenge with live H1N1 and H3N2 influenza virus, but they recovered within a few days. Mice not receiving the mRNA nanoparticles lost too much weight and reached a humane endpoint. All in all, lung delivered mRNA vaccines and nano­ particles containing mRNA producing anti-pathogen proteins provide protection. However, again it is unclear how these protective effects relate to the protection after intramuscular injection.
4.4. Safety
Apart from evaluating efficacy, we also investigated whether pulmonary administration of mRNA-containing nanoparti­ cles is safe. Several components of mRNA vaccines could cause safety issues, among others the mRNA, the produced antigen, the nanoparticle, and the dose. The safety of

pulmonary administered mRNA vaccines is among others dependent on the components and the structure and phy­ sical properties of the nanoparticle used. Li et al. [53] showed that mRNA encapsulated in CP2k and CP600 nano­ particles did not cause substantial changes in tissue mor­ phology, whereas PEI showed elevated levels of IL-6, which is a known pro-inflammatory cytokine. Similar results were shown by Patel et al. [36]. Using H&E staining, they showed that lung delivery of mRNA-containing hDD90-118 nanopar­ ticles resulted in normal lung histology and weight loss was not observed. However, mRNA encapsulated in PEI resulted in weight loss, although inflammation of the lungs was not observed (Figure 4A). This result was confirmed by Tiwari et al. [40], who also showed that lung delivery of mRNA encapsulated in PEI nanoparticles led to weight reduction in mice. These studies showed that PEI nanoparticles are toxic and should not be used for pulmonary delivery of mRNA [94]. Besides PEI, lipids can have toxic effects as well. Andries et al. [35] showed that mRNA-containing nanopar­ ticles build up from GL67, DOPE, and DMPE-PEG5000 lipids led to an increased production of pro-inflammatory cyto­ kines (TNF and IL-6), representing a potential safety con­ cern of these charged and surface-active molecules. On the
other hand, amphotericin B liposomes, containing distearoyl
phosphatidylglycerol sodium salt, has been used by inhala­
tion already in the clinic [95,96].

1480

E. M. JANSEN ET AL.

Besides nanoparticles, naked mRNA raises safety concerns as well. Lorenzi et al. [32] showed that pulmonary administra­ tion of naked mRNA in mice resulted in increased TNF levels, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, which could be caused by the absence of m1. Remarkably, opposite results were shown by Legere et al. [37]. These researchers showed that transfection of naked mRNA in the bronchi of horses did not result in inflammation. This is interesting, since naked mRNA has been shown to lead to the activation of TLR 7/8 which plays a role in the innate inflammatory response [97]. It is therefore suggested that this inflammatory response might be species dependent. Besides the role of the nanoparticle in

inflammation, the dose is important as well. Qiu et al. [33] showed that pulmonary administration of 5 µg mRNAcontaining nanoparticles to mice does not lead to inflamma­ tion in the lungs, nor was weight loss observed (Figure 4B). However, lung delivery of 10 µg of the same type of nanopar­ ticles did lead to an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and caused a weight loss of 6%. These findings were con­ firmed by the study of Van Hoecke et al. [48]. These research­ ers also found minor levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after pulmonary administration of 5 µg mRNA-containing nanopar­ ticles to mice. Fortunately, most animal studies showed no increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines after pulmonary

administration of both naked and mRNA-containing nanopar­ ticles [33,40,45,48,50,98-101]. All in all, the safety of lung delivered mRNA-containing nanoparticles is mainly deter­ mined by the composition of the nanoparticle and the dose.
5. Conclusion
The aim of this literature study was to determine whether pulmonary administration of mRNA vaccines represents a suitable alternative to intramuscular injection. To that end, we carefully reviewed animal studies. These studies clearly showed that a uniform distribution of mRNA over the lung can be achieved when mRNA containing vaccines are properly pulmonary administered. Upon lung delivery, the mRNA is taken up mostly by APCs, owing to their phagocytotic capa­ city. In turn, APCs were shown to successfully express and present the antigens, resulting in the initiation of potent adaptive immune responses, both on a humoral and cellular level. Some studies also demonstrated that this approach protected animals from disease during challenges. With respect to safety, we were able to identify some issues related to the materials that nanoparticles are prepared from; PEI, for example, caused acute inflammation. In future studies, com­ parisons should be made between pulmonary administration and intramuscular injection. This will improve our understand­ ing of whether pulmonary administration of mRNA vaccines could lead to dose-sparing and better protection, for instance.
6. Expert opinion
We identified several omissions and challenges when examin­ ing the publications investigating pulmonary delivered mRNA. For example, fundamental data about the uptake mechanism of the mRNA containing nanoparticles by cells, quantitative data about the amount of protein that is produced by the mRNA, and a connection between the amount of protein produced and the extent of the immune response initiated are lacking. Moreover, the reviewed publications did not take intramuscular injection of mRNA vaccines into account as a control when investigating pulmonary delivery of mRNA vaccines. In the future, studies should investigate differences in humoral and cellular responses in a head-to-head compar­ ison between intramuscular injection and pulmonary admin­ istration of mRNA vaccines, in particular concerning IgA titers. IgA plays a crucial role in the humoral mucosal immune response fighting respiratory infections and it leads to crossprotection [21-26]. In line with this, it has been shown that intrapulmonary and intranasal delivered vaccines against SARS-CoV in rodents and influenza in humans showed a better protection against infection than intramuscular injec­ tion, due to increased IgA levels after pulmonary vaccine delivery [21,102-105]. Moreover, future studies should investi­ gate whether the immune response results in protection and how long immunity through pulmonary vaccination lasts (Figure 5).
Besides the induction of a protective immune response, a pulmonary delivered mRNA vaccine should be proven safe. It was described that pulmonary administration of polymerbased nanoparticles engineered from PEI caused increased

levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the animals lost weight, indicating that PEI is too toxic [36,40,53]. Lipid nano­ particles carrying mRNA administered pulmonary have been considered safe according to the discussed animal studies in this review. Furthermore, clinical data of the intramuscular delivered mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 show that lipid nanoparticles are safe and participants to clinical phase I and II trials where intramuscular delivered mRNA lipid nanoparticles are used to treat different types of cancer tolerate the lipid nanoparticles very well [1,2,4,5,106]. However, detailed infor­ mation about the safety of lipid nanoparticle following pul­ monary delivery is not yet available. Several techniques are available to determine the toxicity of pulmonary administered nanoparticles in the lung: H&E staining, deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), and KI67. With these techniques, inflammation, cell death, and cell pro­ liferation, respectively, can be examined [107-109]. A relatively new technique to examine toxicity is human lung slices, a technique where precision-cut slices of the lungs are exposed to the compound of interest [110]. Tissue slices are especially interesting for short-term toxicity studies. However, we suggest using a carefully chosen animal model to study safety, immune responses, and protection of the mRNA vac­ cines in a living system (e.g. non-human primates) [111].
When sufficient information is available showing that pul­ monary administration of mRNA vaccines is safe and effective, a suitable inhalable formulation should be developed. Various inhalation devices exist, such as soft mist inhalers, nebulizers, metered-dose inhalers, and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) [107,112,113]. Of these devices, DPIs are of particular interest since they are distributed easily and the administration is simple [114-116]. Pulmonary vaccination with DPIs has several advan­ tages over liquid formulations, as discussed in a review by Tonnis et al. [15]. mRNA vaccine powder suitable for inhalation could be engineered by spray-drying or spray-freeze-drying in combination with stabilizing excipients, as discussed in the study of Saluja et al. [117]. We expect that sugars are essential to ensure a good stability of mRNA nanoparticles, since mRNA vaccines are inherently unstable, requiring a cold-chain [73]. Stabilizing excipients like sucrose seems promising since it effec­ tively protects the mRNA-containing nanoparticles from freezing damage [73,118]. Yet, a translation must be made to spraydrying and spray-freeze-drying [17]. We therefore recommend examining different sugars and different conditions for spraydrying and spray-freeze-drying (e.g. flow rate, freezing-rate) in order to engineer a mRNA-containing nanoparticle formulation with a long-term stability, preferably at ambient conditions.
Whilst formulating mRNA vaccines into inhalable dry pow­ ders, special care should be taken to investigate whether they are well-tolerated by patients suffering from respiratory dis­ eases, especially those of a chronic nature (e.g. chronic obstruc­ tive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and asthma). In these patients, the lung architecture may be severely remodeled, affecting not only their ability to inhale but also to elicit effective immune responses [119]. This could affect the efficacy and safety of pulmonary delivered mRNA vaccines. A risk of mRNA delivered pulmonary is that an inflammatory response could be induced. This risk could be reduced by modifying the mRNA, e.g. by replacing uridine by m1

1482

[54,59,61-63]. It is suggested that nanoparticles are safe to inhale for patients with respiratory diseases, since several types of inhalable nanoparticles have already been used in medication for asthma, COPD, and lung cancer, providing positive treatment effects [120]. These data indicate that also mRNA containing nanoparticles can be safely administered to patients suffering from lung diseases via the respiratory route. However, the safety and efficacy aspects of lung delivered mRNA have not yet been examined extensively. We suggest that first the safety and effi­ cacy of different forms of mRNA and mRNA-containing formula­ tions (e.g. nanoparticles) including the effect of composition, structure, and physical properties delivered into the lung should be examined in animal models with respiratory diseases. Consequently, these pulmonary administered mRNA vaccines could be investigated in clinical studies.
In 5 years from now, we expect that more information regard­ ing the efficacy and safety of pulmonary delivered, and intramus­ cular injected mRNA vaccines will be available. First, the short-term safety of mRNA lipid nanoparticles using lung slices, and in parti­ cular human lung slices, will be examined. When the short-term safety is clear, and a suitable lipid nanoparticle is formulated, a preclinical animal study should be performed. Within 5 years more insights into the efficacy and safety of both pulmonary and intramuscularly administered mRNA vaccines, preferably in a headto-head comparison, will be gained. When the safety and efficacy are clear, we can work toward the development of dry and stable inhalable formulations, which are also tolerated by patients suffer­ ing respiratory diseases. The results so far are convincing, indicat­ ing that more research regarding lung delivered mRNA vaccines is worthwhile.

Abstract An efficient host immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-­CoV-­2, COVID-­19) appears to be crucial for controlling and resolving this viral infection. However, many studies have reported autoimmune characteristics in severe COVID-1­ 9 patients. Moreover, clinical observations have revealed that COVID-1­ 9-­associated acute distress respiratory syndrome shares many features in common with inflammatory myopathy including interstitial lung disease (ILD), most particularly rapidly progressive (RP)-I­LD. This study explored this phenomenon by seeking to identify and characterize myositis-­ specific and related autoantibodies in 25 COVID-­19 patients with mild or severe symptoms. Line blot analysis with the EUROLINE Myopathies Ag kit identified 9 (36%) patients with COVID-­19 with one or more autoantibodies against several myositis-­related antigens (Jo-1­ , Ku, Mi-2­ , PL-7­ , PL-­12, PM-­Scl 75, PM-­ Scl 100, Ro-­52, and SRP); no anti-­MDA5 antibodies were detected. As the presence of antibodies identified by line blots was unrelated to disease severity, we further characterized the autoantibodies by radioimmunoassay, in which [35S] methionine-l­abeled K562 cellular antigens were precipitated and visualized by gel electrophoresis. This result was confirmed by an immunoprecipitation assay and immunoblotting; 2 patients exhibited anti-K­ u70 and anti-K­ u80 antibodies.

TEO et al.
Our data suggest that it is necessary to use more than one method to characterize and evaluate autoantibodies in people recovered from COVID-1­ 9, in order to avoid misinterpreting those autoantibodies as diagnostic markers for autoimmune diseases.
Study Highlights WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? SARS-­COV-­2 infection leads to excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, abnormal induction of autoantibodies, and acute distress respiratory syndrome in severe cases. These clinical features are also a clinical phenomenon of interstitial lung disease, which causes morbidity and mortality in patients with inflammatory myopathy. WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS? We determined whether COVID-1­ 9 patients have myositis-s­pecific and related autoantibodies and how levels of these autoantibodies may reflect the severity of SARS-­CoV-­2-­induced lung injury. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE? The combination of line blot assay, radioimmunoassay, and immunoprecipitation assay investigations provides accurate autoantibody data. As line blot identification of myositis-­related autoantibodies was unrelated to disease severity, radioimmunoassay and immunoprecipitation assay data characterized anti-K­ u70 and anti-­Ku80 autoantibodies in COVID-­19 patients. HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRAN­ SLATIONAL SCIENCE? Our data suggest that it is necessary to carefully evaluate the presence of autoantibodies in people recovered after COVID-­19 in order to avoid misinterpreting those autoantibodies as diagnostic markers for autoimmune diseases.

INTRODUCTION
Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, positive-­stranded RNA viruses that infect humans and animals and cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, or neurological diseases. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-C­ oV-2­ , COVID-­19) disease has been a pandemic since December 2019. At the time of writing this article, COVID-­19-r­elated deaths worldwide had reached 5.5 million.1 An efficient host immune response involving innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-­CoV-­2 appears to be crucial for controlling and resolving this viral infection. Notably, the severity of COVID-­19 may be associated with the excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines leading to a "cytokine storm" and subsequent acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).2,3 A variety of autoimmune characteristics have been observed in cases of severe COVID-­19, with the findings of lymphocytopenia (85.7%), elevated levels of C-r­eactive protein (94.7%), and interleukin-6­ (89.5%), as well as anti-5­ 2kDa SSA/Ro (Ro-5­ 2) antibodies (20%), anti-­ 60kDa SSA/Ro (Ro-6­ 0) antibodies (25%), and antinuclear antibodies (50%).4

Over several years of research, our clinical observations
have revealed that COVID-­19-­associated ARDS shares
many autoimmune features with interstitial pneumonia,
particularly with a rapidly progressive (RP) interstitial
lung disease (ILD), including melanoma differentiation-­ associated gene 5 (MDA5) antibody-a­ ssociated RP-­ILD.5-­7
These common features include ARDS, pathological lung

cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with dermatomyositis (DM), because of ARDS.11-­13 Our research and
other studies have shown that autoantibodies in DM are
highly associated with ILD, particularly RP-­ILD, and serve as prognosis markers for autoimmune-­related ILD.5,11,14-­16

immunity has a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of
RP-­ILD, suggesting a pathological role for autoantibodies.

MYOSITIS-­RELATED ANTIBODIES IN COVID-­19 PATIENTS

relationship between anti-M­ DA5 antibodies and DM-I­ LD, anti-­MDA5 antibodies are strongly associated with RP-­ ILD.11 COVID-1­9-a­ssociated mortality differs amongst different age groups,18 which suggests the involvement of an age-­related immune regulatory factor. Since autoantibody production increases with aging19 and MDA5 is an innate immune sensor for coronaviruses,20 it is possible that pre-­existing or viral-­induced anti-M­ DA5 antibodies or other myositis-­related autoantibodies may play a role in the pathogenesis of SARS-­CoV-­2-­induced lung injury.
Although various anti-­immune or anti-i­nflammatory inhibitors, interleukin-6­ (IL-6­ ) inhibitors, IL-­1 inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors, corticosteroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin have all been suggested as therapeutic options for COVID-­19 patients,2,21 immunosuppression for hyperinflammation in COVID-­19 could be a double-­edged sword due to the lack of a prognostic marker for disease severity. Thus, factors are urgently needed that can predict progression towards severe acute lung injury. In this study, the combination of line blot assay, radioimmunoassay, and immunoprecipitation assay investigations provided accurate autoantibody data. Line blot identification of myositis-­related autoantibodies was unrelated to disease severity. Radioimmunoassay and immunoprecipitation assay data characterized anti-­Ku70 and anti-K­ u80 autoantibodies in COVID-­19 patients.
METHODS
Cell culture

The ILD reference samples were collected from patients diagnosed with ILD in China Medical Hospital, Taiwan. Each ILD reference sample positively reacts with a corresponding indicated antigen, as confirmed by both the EUROLINE Autoimmune Inflammatory Myopathies 16 Ag (IgG) (DL 1530-1­ 601-4­ G) kit and radioimmunoprecipitation assays conducted in our laboratory (used for research or diagnostic purposes). The EUROLINE Autoimmune Inflammatory Myopathies 16 Ag (IgG)(DL 1530-1­601-­4 G) kit screened for related autoantibodies in the 25 COVID-­19 patient sera samples, following the manufacturer's instructions: EJ, glycyl-t­RNA synthetase; Jo-1­, histidyl-t­RNA synthetase; Ku, DNA binding protein; MDA5, melanoma differentiation-­associated protein 5; Mi-­2, chromodomain-­helicase-­DNA-­binding protein (CHD) 3; Mi-2­, chromodomain-­helicase-­DNA-­binding protein (CHD) 4; NPX2, nuclear matrix protein 2; OJ, isoleucyl-t­RNA synthetase multienzyme complex; PM-­Scl 75, polymyositis-s­cleroderma 1 complex protein (75 kD); PM-­Scl 100, polymyositis-­scleroderma 1 complex protein (100 kD); PL-7­ , threonyl-t­RNA synthetase; PL-1­ 2, alanyl-­ tRNA synthetase; Ro-­52, tripartite motif-c­ontaining protein 21 (TRIM21); SAE1, small ubiquitin-l­ike modifier 1 activating enzyme; SRP, signal recognition particle; TIF1, transcriptional intermediary factor 1 gamma. The EUROLineScan program was used to evaluate the signal intensity from each line blot. Based on the signal intensity, we could classify the results into four groups: 0-­5 (0, negative); 6-1­ 0 ([+], borderline); 11-2­ 5 or 26-5­ 0 (+ or ++, positive); and >50 (+++, strongly positive). The borderline (+) results should be evaluated as an increase, but negative.

K562 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 (RPMI 1640, Gibco) medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic-­ antimycotic (Gibco) and maintained at 37°C in a humified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were subcultured every 2 to 3days. Mycoplasma contamination testing was performed using a MycoAlert kit (Lonza).
Patients and methods
Twenty-­five COVID-­19 Hispanic or Caucasian sera samples were purchased from Boca Biolistics in the USA. We included COVID-1­9 patients without pre-e­xisting conditions, as described in Table 1. All patients were documented as having SARS-­CoV-­2 infection by either the Cepheid GeneXpert or Roche Cobas system. SARS-­CoV-­ 2-­associated immunoglobulin G (IgG) was measured by the SARS-C­ oV-­2 IgG assay (Architect). Nine sera samples from myositis-­specific antibody-r­elated ILD patients and 2 healthy controls were collected by Dr. Joung-L­ iang Lan.

Autoantibody purification
All sera in this study were used to purify the autoantibodies for immunoprecipitation. Sera were centrifuged at 17,970g and 4°C for 5min to remove impurities. The sera were then incubated with protein G beads (GeneTex) and protein A beads (GE Healthcare) at a ratio of 1:1 in NP-­40 buffer (for cytosol antigens: 150mM NaCl [Sigma], 20mM, pH8.0 Tris-­HCl [Sigma], 5mM EDTA [Sigma] and 0.1% NP-­40 [Sigma]; for nucleus antigens: 300mM NaCl, 20mM, pH8.0 Tris-H­ Cl, 5mM EDTA and 0.3% NP-­ 40) at 4°C for 1h. The beads were conjugated with autoantibodies and washed once with the same buffer and were then ready to use in immunoprecipitation investigations.
Radioimmunoassay
Cells were seeded into a 10cm dish at a concentration of 6x105 cells/ml and cultured overnight with RPMI medium

containing [35S]methionine (EasyTagTM Methionine, L-­ [35S]-­, PerkinElmer). On the second day, cells were lysed with NP-­40 buffer (for cytosol antigens: 150mM NaCl, 20mM, pH8.0 Tris-H­ Cl, 5mM EDTA and 1% NP-­40; for nucleus antigens: 300mM NaCl, 20mM, pH8.0 Tris-H­ Cl, 5mM EDTA and 1% NP-­40) and cleared by centrifugation at 17,970 g and 4°C for 15min. The cell lysates were cleaned with protein G beads for 30min then centrifuged at 5870g and 4°C for 5min to remove the beads. Cell lysates were incubated with beads conjugated with the autoantibodies purified from patient sera in NP-4­ 0 buffer, identical to the buffer used in the purification process, at 4°C for 4h. Beads were washed four times with the same NP-­40 buffer. Proteins were eluted into dye containing 2-­mercaptoethanol (2ME, Sigma) at 100°C for 10min and resolved with gel electrophoresis using NuPAGE 4%-1­ 2%

Bis-­Tris Gel (InvitrogenTMNOVEXTM). Gels were dried on a heater at 60°C for 6h. High-p­ erformance chemiluminescence film (GE Healthcare) visualized signals from [35S]methionine of the protein. Films were exposed to gels in a cassette at -80°C for 7 or 14days.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
K562 cells were lysed with NP-4­ 0 buffer (150mM NaCl, 20mM, pH8.0 Tris-­HCl, 5mM EDTA, and 1% NP-4­ 0) and cleared by centrifugation at 17,970 g and 4°C for 15min. Cell lysates (50 l) were prepared as the control for immunoprecipitation. The remaining cell lysates were cleaned with protein G beads for 20min then centrifuged at 5870 g and 4°C for 1min to remove the beads.

MYOSITIS-­RELATED ANTIBODIES IN COVID-­19 PATIENTS
The supernatant was split equally between each group. Patient sera samples were added and the mixtures were incubated by rotation at 4°C for 2.5h (150mM NaCl, 20mM, pH8.0 Tris-­HCl, 5mM EDTA, and 0.1% NP-4­ 0). The mixtures were incubated with beads at 4°C for another 30min. Supernatant was removed after centrifugation. Beads were washed three times with the same NP-­40 buffer. Proteins were eluted into dye at 60°C for 10min. After centrifugation, dyes containing proteins were moved without the beads to new Eppendorf tubes. 2-­ME was added into protein samples and the mixtures were incubated at 95°C for 10min to denature the proteins. Protein samples were resolved on Bis-­Tris sodium dodecyl sulfate-­ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-­PAGE) gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP (Millipore) visualized proteins on the ChemiDocTM MP imaging system (BIO-­RAD). Ku-­70 polyclonal antibody (10723-­1-­AP), Ku-­80 polyclonal antibody (16389-1­ -­AP), and TARS polyclonal antibody (14773-1­ -­AP) were purchased from the Proteintech Group, Inc.
Statistical analysis
Patients were classified into two groups based on time required for mechanical ventilation: mild cases and severe cases. The 2 test was used to compare categorical variables. A two-­tailed p <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Ethics committee approval
Twenty-f­ive Hispanic or Caucasian COVID-­19 sera samples were purchased from Boca Biolistics in the USA, under approval from an Independent Investigational Review Board, Inc., for Boca Biolistics in the USA (SOP 10-0­ 0414 Rev E). Nine sera samples from myositis-­specific antibody-­related ILD patients and two healthy controls were collected by Dr. Joung-L­ iang Lan, under approval from the Ethics Committee of China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan (CMUH104-­REC3-­093).
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Clinical parameters of the 25 patients with COVID-­19 are shown in Table 1. All patients had a positive molecular diagnosis of SARS-­CoV-­2 and were separated into two

 |5
groups based on mechanical ventilation requirements (mild, n = 12; severe, n = 13). Sixteen patients were men and 9 were women, with an average age of 53years. In the mild group, 2 patients were not hospitalized and only 1 patient was hospitalized for more than 15days. In the severe group, all 13 patients were hospitalized for more than 15days. Eight of the 25 patients were smokers; 3 were in the mild group and 5 in the severe group. Fever was the most common symptom (92% of all patients had an average body temperature of 38.8°C); only 2 patients in the mild group did not have a fever. Breathing difficulties afflicted 33% of patients in the mild group and 77% of the severe group. All COVID-1­ 9 patients were positive for IgG antibody against SARS-­CoV-­2.
Positivity of myositis-­related autoantibodies identified by line blotting
To determine whether autoantibodies against myositis-­ specific or related antigens are present in patients with COVID-­19, an immunoblot analysis of sera from all patients was performed using the commercial EUROLINE kit, which contains myositis-s­pecific or related antigens, including MDA5. The EUROLINE kit is a clinical diagnosis kit that is routinely used to detect autoantibodies in autoimmune patients; healthy individuals have a relatively very low incidence of positive results. Corresponding specificities with and without anti-S­SA/Ro52 were 62.34% and 96.10%, respectively.22,23 Table 2 demonstrates that the entire study cohort displayed autoantibodies against myositis-s­ pecific and related antigens, including Jo-1­ , Ku, Mi-­2, PL-7­, PL-1­2, PM-S­cl 75, PM-S­cl 100, Ro-5­2, and SRP. Some 28% had one autoantibody, 4% had two autoantibodies, and 4% had three or more autoantibodies. In total, 36% of patients had one or more myositis-­related autoantibodies. Autoantibodies in individual patients are shown in Table 3. Despite the high prevalence of myositis-­ related autoantibodies, these did not relate to disease severity (Table 2). These data suggest that while patients with COVID-­19 may be highly positive for myositis-r­ elated autoantibodies, these are not associated with disease severity.
Radioimmunoassay confirmation of myositis-­related autoantibodies
To further verify the presence of autoantibodies in the sera of patients with COVID-­19, we performed the radioimmunoassay using immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-­ labeled K562 cellular antigens to confirm the molecular pattern of each antigen. In this experiment, we used sera from patients with RP-I­LD as the positive control of each

antigen that was recognized by autoantibodies. The signal of each antigen was identified with the correct molecular weight using sera from patients with RP-­ILD (Figure 1), which is consistent with previously published data. One or more specific protein bands in each lane of ILD patients served as positive controls to demonstrate the presence of the specific autoantibody against each Ag (Figure 1; the solid arrowheads indicate specific antigens). We subsequently tested all positive samples identified by the EUROIMMUN kit, as shown in Figure 1. In contrast to the data from the previous screening, we could not detect any obviously positive signals in sera from patients with COVID-1­ 9 (Figure 1). Only two samples, COVID-­19-6­ and COVID-­19-2­0 (Figure 1a; lanes 3 and 5 and Figure 1b; lanes 1 and 3), with the empty arrowhead in Figure 1, displayed a background similar to that of RP-­ILD patients (ILD-­PL-­7 and ILD-K­ u) with both anti-­PL-­7 (Figure 1a; lane 6 and Figure 1b; lane 4) and anti­Ku (Figure 1a; lane 7 and Figure 1b; lane 5) autoantibodies. Notably, immunoprecipitation detected many unidentified

protein bands in patients with COVID-­19 that did not correspond with the myositis-r­ elated autoantibodies we screened, which implies that there could be other unknown autoantibodies present in those patients. Using immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting revealed two patients (#6 and #20) with anti-K­ u or anti-P­L-­7 antibodies, who had previously displayed the same antibodies. Immunoblots (Figure 2a,b) identified anti-K­ u70 and anti-­Ku80 antibodies in both patients. In contrast, we did not observe anti-­PL-­7 antibodies (Figure 2c). These data suggest considerable inconsistency between the three diagnostic methods, with the radioimmunoassay showing the greatest accuracy in identifying autoantibodies in patients with COVID-1­ 9.
DISCUSSION
Recent studies have suggested that SARS-C­ oV-­2 infection stimulates the production of many autoantibodies,

including anti-­Ro52 antibody (20%), anti-­Ro60 antibody (25%), antinuclear antibody (50%),4,24,25 and anti-­type I interferon (IFN) antibody.26 Autoantibodies against type I IFNs are highly related to life-­threatening SARS-­CoV-­2 infection,26 suggesting the importance of autoantibodies in immune dysregulation. We therefore screened for the presence of these myositis-r­ elated autoantibodies in order to understand whether or not they are involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-­19 or serve as prognostic markers for these patients. Consistent with a previous publication that used dot blot analysis,4 we identified myositis-r­elated autoantibodies anti-R­ o 52 and anti-­ Jo-1­. We also found other autoantibodies, including anti-­Ku, anti-­Mi-­2, anti-­PL-­7, anti-­PL-­12, anti-­PM-­Scl 75, anti-P­ M-­Scl 100, and anti-S­ RP antibodies and 36% of the patients in our cohort had one or more myositis-­ related autoantibodies identified by line blots with the EUROLINE Myopathies Ag kit. However, none of these autoantibodies was related to disease severity. We therefore decided to further characterize the pattern of autoantigens. After analyzing these antibodies by radioimmunoassay and immunoprecipitation assay, we discovered that the results were inconsistent between the line blot analysis and radioimmunoassay findings. The molecular patterns suggested that some autoantibodies did not reflect the correct molecular weight, which implies that these antibodies may not target myositis-­ related antigens. Previous studies have revealed the

inconsistency between the results of the line blot and immunoprecipitation.27-­29 Moreover, many previously reported that autoantibodies, such as anti-R­ o-­52 antibody and anti-J­o-1­ antibody,4 may share the same features and thus require further characterization with, for instance, a radioimmunoassay, which differs from the line blots, to confirm specific antigens.
There is growing evidence that antibody-m­ ediated immunity has a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune-­related ILD.5,14,15 Although the causal relationship between autoantibodies and ILD remains to be clarified, our research group and others have shown that myositis-r­elated autoantibodies are highly associated with ILD, particularly RP-­ILD.5,11,14-­16 Other studies have also shown that SARS-­CoV-2­ infection can trigger autoimmune responses,4,25 which may not only relate to COVID-­19-a­ ssociated mortality but may also shape immune regulation to an autoimmune disease-­prone status. As depicted in Figure 1, the normal controls have a clear background without autoantibodies, whereas COVID-­19 patients developed many autoantibodies against different cellular antigens that are very similar to those in autoimmune RP-I­LD patients, who have a strong background of high-l­evel autoantibodies. Although a specific autoantibody for COVID-1­ 9 remains to be identified, our findings support the hypothesis that SARS-­CoV-­2 infection can trigger immune dysregulation and this dysregulation may persist in patients even after they recover from the

The assessment of both anti-a­minoacyl-­tRNA synthetase and anti-­MDA5 autoantibodies is useful for predicting the clinical course and prognosis of DM/DM-­ILD patients.30 Anti-­aminoacyl-­tRNA synthetase antibodies, including anti-­Jo-­1, anti-­PL-­7, anti-­PL-­12, anti-­EJ, and anti-­OJ antibodies, are associated with a wide spectrum of autoimmune diseases, including myositis and ILD.30 Moreover, anti-­aminoacyl-­tRNA synthetase antibodies are associated with a better prognosis in DM/DM-­ILD patients,31,32 whereas anti-­MDA5 antibodies are associated with a poorer prognosis in these patients.33 Despite some evidence demonstrating the presence of anti-­ MDA5 antibodies in patients infected with SARS-­CoV-­2, very few reports have suggested a possible pathological role of anti-M­ DA5 antibodies during this infection.34 However, as we show in Table 1, no positive patients in our cohort were found to have anti-M­ DA5 antibodies. In contrast, some patients presented with anti-K­ u70 and anti-K­ u80 autoantibodies. The genetic background of our Hispanic and Caucasian cohort may mean that these patients rarely have the human leukocyte antigens (HLA) DRB1*0101/*0405 and DRB1*0401/*12:02, which are found in the Han Chinese and Japanese and are highly associated with the presence of anti-­MDA5 antibodies.35,36 This genetic difference may explain the absence of anti-­MDA5 antibodies in our report, although Wang et al.34 have reported finding that 48.2% (132/274) of COVID-­19 patients in China presented with anti-M­ DA5 autoantibodies, identified by immunoprecipitation and enzyme-­linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Isotope-­labeled protein immunoprecipitation with serum or plasma is the gold standard, showing high sensitivity for determining the existence of an autoantibody. Differences in genetic backgrounds and methodologies might explain this controversial finding. In this study, we have evaluated the presence of myositis-­related antibodies, anti-K­ u70 and anti-­Ku80, using multiple methods to confirm whether these antibodies contribute to the prognosis of COVID-­19 patients. Several reports have suggested the presence of autoantibodies in COVID-­19 patients,25,26,37,38 but have lacked further confirmation by either radioimmunoassay or immunoprecipitation assay. On the strength of our study results, we recommend that investigations into these autoantibodies are revised, using the gold standard method of radioimmunoassay.

ABSTRACT This article reports on an American Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Division of Drug Metabolism and Disposition symposium held at Experimental Biology on April 2nd, 2022, in Philadelphia. As of July 2022, over 500 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) and over 12,000,000,000 vaccine doses have been administered. Clinically significant interactions between viral infections and hepatic drug metabolism were first recognized over 40 years ago during a cluster of pediatric theophylline toxicity cases attributed to reduced hepatic drug metabolism amidst an influenza B outbreak. Today, a substantive body of research supports that the activated innate immune response generally decreases hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity. The interactions extend to drug transporters and other organs and have the potential to impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Based on this knowledge, altered ADME is predicted with SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. The report begins with a clinical case exploring the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination increasing clozapine levels. This is followed by discussions of how SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccines alter the metabolism and disposition of complex drugs, such as nanoparticles and biologics and small molecule therapies. The review concludes with a discussion of the effects of viral infections on placental amino acid transport and their potential to impact fetal development. The session improved our understanding of the impact of emerging viral infections and vaccine technologies on drug metabolism and disposition, which will help mitigate drug toxicity and improve drug and vaccine safety and effectiveness.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Altered pharmacokinetics of small molecule and complex molecule drugs and fetal brain distribution of amino acids following SARS-CoV-2 infection or immunization are possible. The proposed mechanisms involve decreased liver CYP metabolism of small molecules, enhanced innate immune system metabolism of complex molecules and altered placental and fetal bloodbrain barrier amino acid transport, respectively. Future research is needed to understand the effects of these interactions on adverse drug responses, drug and vaccine safety and effectiveness and fetal neurodevelopment.

Introduction Historical perspectives. Early observations of interactions between infectious diseases and drug metabolism and disposition date to the 1960s and 70s. These observations included altered quinine metabolism during malaria infection, increased theophylline half-life in children with influenza infection or adenoviral respiratory tract infections and increased cerebrospinal fluid accumulation of ethambutol and rifampin in tuberculosis meningitis (Brooks et al., 1969; Place et al., 1969; Sippel et al., 1974; Chang et al., 1978). Around the same time period, pioneering work completed by Renton and Mannering discovered that interferon-inducing agents decreased hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) activities, paving the way for the idea that inflammatory cytokines are a regulatory link between infectious or inflammatory diseases and hepatic drug metabolism (Renton and Mannering, 1976a; Renton and Mannering, 1976b). Shortly thereafter, the clinical significance of interactions between infections and hepatic drug metabolism were established during a cluster of pediatric theophylline toxicity cases attributed to reduced hepatic CYP1A metabolism amidst an influenza B outbreak in 1980 in Seattle, Washington (Kraemer et al., 1982).
In the ensuing years there have been many clinical studies and case reports in adult humans supporting that infections or inflammation downregulate hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, although increases in activity have also been reported in some instances (as recently reviewed (Goralski et al., 2018; Lenoir et al., 2021c)). The observed effects on hepatic CYP metabolism are dependent on the type of inflammatory or infectious stimuli and the specific CYP enzyme (Goralski et al., 2018; Lenoir et al., 2021c). The metabolism of CYP3A4, CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 substrates appears to be most affected with lesser or no impact on CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 substrates (Lenoir et al., 2021a; Lenoir et al., 2021c). Most commonly, a temporary

reduction in hepatic clearance and prolongation of half-life of elimination is observed. In some cases, the suspected interactions have led to elevated drug levels and drug-related adverse responses as observed for the CYP1A2 substrates, theophylline, and clozapine, the CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 substrate voriconazole and the CYP3A4 substrates tacrolimus and cyclosporine (Lenoir et al., 2021c). Similar interactions between infections or inflammation and hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolism are also observed in children but are less well studied overall compared to adults (Lenoir et al., 2021b).
Mechanisms of interactions. The regulation of hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolism by the innate immune response to infectious and inflammatory stimuli has been studied in preclinical animal models and human cellular models and involves a combination of transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms (Goralski et al., 2018; de Jong et al., 2020) as summarized in Fig. 1 and detailed below. Briefly, pathogen-associated molecular patterns including microbial nucleic acids, lipopolysaccharides and other virulence factors serve as the primary stimuli and interact with membrane-bound or intracellular pattern recognition receptors (e.g. Toll-like receptors) on host tissue epithelium and tissue resident macrophages to stimulate the innate immune response and ensuing cytokine (e.g. interferons (IFN), interleukin (IL) -1 and IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)) release (Medzhitov, 2010). In turn, cytokines, bind to their respective receptors on hepatocytes to activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) signaling, which directly represses transcription of some CYPs or reduces the nuclear localization or dimerization of transcription factors including pregnane X receptor, constitutive androstane receptor and aryl hydrocarbon receptor, resulting in reduced binding to CYP promoter regions and reduced CYP mRNA expression (de Jong et al., 2020; Stanke-Labesque et al., 2020).

associated molecular patterns to toll-like receptors on hepatocytes, which activates NF-B signaling, is an additional mechanism whereby CYPs can be downregulated. While not as well studied, epigenetic mechanisms and post-transcriptional regulation of CYP mRNA by microRNAs have also been demonstrated (Stanke-Labesque et al., 2020). In addition, the activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 during the innate immune response increases nitric oxide which can regulate CYP enzyme function via transcriptional mechanisms, CYP degradation and catalytic inhibition (Donato et al., 1997; Morgan et al., 2020). The interactions between infectious stimuli are not limited to hepatic metabolism and clearance. Infectious and inflammatory stimuli have been reported to decrease intestinal and hepatic efflux transport, increase renal tubule drug transport, increase, or decrease blood-brain barrier drug efflux transport and decrease placental drug efflux transport (Goralski et al., 2018). Based on these broad interactions, there is potential for viral infections to impact drug absorption, drug distribution, drug metabolism and drug excretion processes.
SARs-CoV-2 infection and interactions with hepatic CYP metabolism. At the time of writing this article, an estimated 547 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) and over 12,000,000,000 vaccine doses have been administered (Soriano et al., 2022). COVID-19 symptoms range from mild or asymptomatic in the least severe cases, to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in the most severe cases (Garcia, 2020; Gao et al., 2021). Based on the understanding of interactions between the innate immune response and hepatic CYP metabolism, the downregulation of hepatic CYP is probable during SARS-CoV-2 due to increases in systemic concentrations of CYP-regulating cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, TNF and IFN- (Huang et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2021). Of particular concern may be

patients with severe COVID-19 who experience dysregulated pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses with elevated IL-6 levels that correlate with disease severity and worse clinical outcomes (Chen et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2021; Yin et al., 2021). Clinical reports of patients with elevated levels of lopinavir, darunavir and clozapine during the pandemic provided initial evidence of downregulation of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 in SARs-CoV-2-infected individuals (Cojutti et al., 2020; Cranshaw and Harikumar, 2020; Gregoire et al., 2020; Marzolini et al., 2020; Schoergenhofer et al., 2020). Adding strength to the initial evidence, a well-designed study that phenotyped SARS-CoV-2-infected patients during and after the infection using the Geneva cocktail approach found reduced CYP3A4, CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 metabolism, respectively, characterized by reduced metabolite to dose ratios of OH-midazolam/midazolam, OH-omeprazole/omeprazole and paraxanthine/caffeine (Lenoir et al., 2021d).
Historically, the impact of vaccines on hepatic CYP metabolism is less clear. As recently reviewed, most human studies or case reports have focused on influenza A vaccine interactions with the CYP2C9 substrate warfarin and CYP1A2 substrate theophylline with fewer studies of other CYPs or other vaccines (Lenoir et al., 2021c). Most studies did not find that the pharmacokinetics of drugs were significantly impacted; however, a few smaller studies or case reports suggested that interactions could occur in some individuals depending on patient factors (e.g. age, disease, basal CYP metabolism), drug and vaccine formulation and time after vaccination (Lenoir et al., 2021c). Theoretically, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA and adenoviral vaccine interactions with hepatic CYP metabolism are possible but there has been a lack of prospective studies in this regard.

The ensuing symposium report begins with a discussion of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and emergency use SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on hepatic CYP450 expression and function and explores the potential clinical implications of such interactions through discussion of a case report of transiently high clozapine levels in a patient treated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Section three of the report discusses emerging evidence of inhibition of clearance of nanoparticles and biological therapies following SARS-CoV-2 infection and the potential risk for drug related toxicities. The report concludes with a discussion of the effects of viral infections on placental amino acid transport and their potenital to impact fetal development and a summary of unanswered questions and future research questions.
A case report exploring the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination increasing clozapine levels (W.G.H.)
Despite the challenges of prescribing and demands for monitoring, clozapine retains a unique place among antipsychotic drugs on account of proven efficacy in schizophrenia with limited response to other antipsychotic medications (Wagner et al., 2021). Side effects include metabolic disorders and weight gain, and effects on gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and hematological systems (Gurrera et al., 2022). Some side effects are associated with dose or plasma-level, others are more pronounced during dose escalation phases of treatment. Neurological, dose-related side effects of clozapine include sedation, abnormalities in the electroencephalogram, seizures, myoclonus, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, delirium; and through innervation of other organ systems: tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, hypersalivation, and enuresis (Tio et al., 2021; Gurrera et al., 2022).

The risk of hematological side effects requires monitoring of white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts during clozapine treatment. Following initiation of clozapine treatment, white blood cell counts (including neutrophils) typically rise slightly over the first week, fall to a slightly lower level than baseline over the second week, returning to baseline at the end of the second week (Blackman et al., 2021). During the first six weeks of treatment, levels of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor TNF and IL-6 rise, as does the level of the cytokine receptor soluble IL-2 (Roge et al., 2012). At steady state, the risk of neutropenia and rarely, agranulocytosis persists. The levels of immunoglobulins IgA, IgM and IgG are slightly low, as are the levels of class-switched memory B-lymphocytes (Ponsford et al., 2018; Ponsford et al., 2019).
Clozapine levels in blood are sensitive to activity of the main metabolizing enzyme, CYP1A2 (Eiermann et al., 1997). This activity is in turn sensitive to inhibition by drugs such as fluvoxamine, and to stimulation by exposure to smoked tobacco. Infection can increase clozapine levels in blood through an immunological cascade, beginning with antigen-presenting dendritic cells releasing cytokines detected by receptors in hepatocytes, leading to transcription factor expression and down-regulation of CYPs (Renton, 2005). An increase in the ratio of clozapine to the primary metabolite norclozapine suggests inhibition of CYP1A2 activity (Stanke-Labesque et al., 2020). During infection and inflammation, hepatocytes simultaneously release C-reactive protein, a biomarker indexing the inflammatory response (Sproston and Ashworth, 2018).
The COVID-19 pandemic created multiple challenges for clozapine treatment. The first was concern for continued access to hematological monitoring, resulting in a recommendation from

an international working group for less frequent monitoring in well-stabilized patients (Siskind et al., 2020). An early retrospective cohort study raised concern that the usual hematological side effects of clozapine could increase risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection; this was not supported by a much larger study of antipsychotic-treated patients with severe infection (Govind et al., 2021; Ohlis et al., 2022). Clozapine-treated patients experiencing SARS-CoV-2 infection had a small decrease in neutrophils and lymphocytes over the first 7 days after becoming symptomatic, with return to normal levels by 14 days (Gee and Taylor, 2021). However, case reports indicated clozapine levels could rise as much as three-fold during SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an increase in the clozapine:norclozapine ratio (Tio et al., 2021). Dose reduction was recommended for clozapine-treated patients experiencing signs and symptoms consistent with clozapine toxicity (Siskind et al., 2020; Veerman et al., 2022).
Not surprisingly, the cellular and molecular response to vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 shares features of infection (Sahin et al., 2020). Neutrophils increase slightly and lymphocytes decline after 2 days, returning to normal after 8 days. Cytokine release occurs, and C-reactive protein rises transiently at day 2. These observations during the registration studies of an mRNA vaccine suggested that similar effects in clozapine-treated patients could be associated with increased clozapine level, and possible toxicity. We reported a case with findings suggestive of such an effect (Thompson et al., 2021).
In brief, a 51-year-old nonsmoking man with a long history of schizoaffective disorder had been treated with clozapine for over 10 years. He received an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) for SARS-CoV-2, and 4 days later developed delirium, falls, incontinence and tachycardia (pulse rate 129/min). He was hospitalized due to concern for infection as the cause of these symptoms -

however, repeated SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were negative, as were other tests for infection. Fig. 2 provides a graphical representation of risk factors, clinical and laboratory findings, and course of illness in four domains: a) diagnosis of the presenting problem, b) patient-related factors, c) comorbidities, and d) treatment-related (vaccine and clozapine) (Thompson et al., 2021). Past experience included a non-COVID pneumonia 3 months previously, with elevation of neutrophils and slight lowering of lymphocytes, associated with a high C-reactive protein level, as expected with an acute infection. As well, the clozapine level and clozapine:norclozapine ratio were elevated. Of note, following the resolution of pneumonia, the clozapine:norclozapine ratio remained > 2.0, suggesting the patient was a slow metabolizer of clozapine at baseline. Multiple comorbidities were noted, with sleep apnea possibly increasing risk for neurological toxicity of clozapine. Elevation of clozapine level, and clozapine:norclozapine ratio was detected on admission, as well as a high C-reactive protein level and neutrophil/lymphocyte responses similar to the previous pneumonia, all consistent with the pathway from immune stimulation to CYP inhibition described above. Interestingly, a computed tomography scan revealed an unsuspected normal pressure hydrocephalus, a neurological finding that could also contribute to the risk for delirium and other symptoms associated with an acute increase in clozapine level. Clozapine was held for two days, the level fell from 1078 ng/mL (3296 nM/L) to 396 ng/mL (1212 nM/L), and the clozapine/norclozapine ratio declined from 3.75 to 1.57. The symptoms of toxicity cleared.
This single case study provides a temporal sequence of associations that support transient clozapine toxicity as the origin of symptoms. Adopting the approach to clinical and laboratory findings illustrated in Fig. 2 is analogous to an organizational strategy used to report the clinical expression of pathophysiology in HIV-related neuropsychiatric disorders, and may have wider value (Ances and Letendre, 2019). Observations from case studies need to be supported or

discounted based on findings in larger cohort studies. A report of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in 139 patients treated with clozapine found no clinically significant changes in symptoms or hematological parameters, but did support the observation from the present case of an increase in median clozapine level (after second dose) of effect size 0.28 and p=0.003 (Veerman et al., 2022). Larger studies such as this could provide the opportunity to investigate potentially complex interactions that could occur with CYP1A2 activity depending on concurrent exposures, such as the smoking status of patients. To summarize, case-based and cohort studies conclude that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is indicated and safe in patients treated with clozapine, and supplementing with reminders on watching for symptoms or signs of clozapine toxicity after vaccination may be a useful precautionary measure to help maintain patients safely on clozapine therapy.
Impact of emerging infections and vaccines on CYP450 metabolism (M.A.C.)
People with highest risk of complications from COVID-19 are those with underlying medical conditions (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung disease) which require use of several medicinal agents for maintenance therapy (Peng et al., 2021; Touyz et al., 2021; Conway et al., 2022; Geca et al., 2022). Although there are few studies in the literature that specifically focus on how virus infection imapcts hepatic and renal drug metabolism, there are data to suggest that drug metabolism will be impacted during various stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection and after administration of emergency use vaccines.
Active Infection. The most obvious time of concern is during active infection with SARS-CoV2, virus production and shedding starts several days before the inflammatory phase where

circulating cytokines can suppress hepatic and renal drug metabolism (Fig. 3). However, changes in CYP expression and function could start as soon as SARS-CoV-2 enters the kidney and liver tissues as the spike protein has been shown to engage integrins as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors for cell entry (Fig. 4A,(Liu et al., 2022)). Integrins are heterodimeric receptors, consiting of an  and  subunit (Fig. 4B). Activation of the integrin receptors is tightly regulated and bidirectional and is mediated through binding of external stimulators (virus, bacteria, RGD rich peptides) or internally through the binding of the intracellular protein talin with the  subunit of the receptor (Kadry and Calderwood, 2020). Talin-mediated signalling is essential for productive SARS-CoV-2 infection and evidence suggests it serves as a molecular link between infection and CYP3A function (Simons et al., 2021). In support of this, the removal of RGD integrin binding domains from the capsid of a recombinant adenovirus and treatment of human hepatocytes with small interfering RNA specific for the  subunit of integrin receptors reversed the suppression of CYP3A activty and expression normally seen during infection in mice (Jonsson-Schmunk et al., 2016). Additionally, new data from our laboratory show that silencing of talin in uninfected human hepatocytes increases CYP3A4 metabolic capacity 2.5fold (Fig. 4C). Taken togther this suggests that the ability of drugs to be cleared by the kidney or the liver is compromised at the time the virus spike protein engages integrin receptors (Fig. 4A). Cytokine production in response to the virus further establishes this effect (Fig. 3). While hepatic and renal CYPs have been shown to return to baseline levels once virus infection has resolved (Callahan et al., 2005; Le et al., 2006; Croyle, 2009), the suppression of CYPs may be extended in the case of severe and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, both characterized by hyper- and extended inflammatory states (Fig. 3, (Nalbandian et al., 2021; Lamers and Haagmans, 2022)).

Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS)/Re-Infection. The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines PACS as a variety of new, returning, or ongoing health problems that people experience 4 or more weeks after first being infected with SARS-CoV-2 while the World Health Organization defines it as a condition that occurs 3 months from the onset of symptomatic COVID-19 that lasts for at least 2 months and cannot be explained through alternative diagnosis (Chippa et al., 2022; Soriano et al., 2022). PACS is associated with presistant virus, viral antigen and viral RNA in tissues such as the liver and kidney that create chronic inflammation as well as autoimmune states (Ramakrishnan et al., 2021; Copur et al., 2022). This provides the conditions that could lead to a prolonged significant impairment of CYP expression and activity in patients with PACS. It is also important to note that post-acute syndromes also occur with other viral pathogens such as West Nile and influenza viruses (Choutka et al., 2022). To date, the impact of PACS on renal and hepatic drug metabolism has not been evaluated in animal models of disease nor the clinic. As the pandemic progressed, reports of re-infection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants and breakthrough infections in vaccinated pateints occurred at an increasing rate (Negi et al., 2021; Mohseni Afshar et al., 2022). Although this phenomenon is common with other viruses such as influenza, the impact of re-infection on hepatic and renal drug metabolism has not yet been evaluated.
Immunization. To date, over 12 billion people have recived at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine with approximately 5 billion successfully receiving a complete initial protocol (Mathieu et al., 2021). The most commonly observed adverse reactions to these vaccines include erythema, fever, fatigue, headache and hypersensitivity reactions (Kouhpayeh and Ansari, 2022; Lau and Vadlamudi, 2022). These types of reactions are transient and usually resolve within 48-72 hours. They are also commonly associated with other vaccines and are caused by the production and

release of cytokines into the circulation (2011; Herve et al., 2019). While several reports have described interactions between drugs with narrow therapeutic windows and influenza vaccines (Raaska et al., 2001; Robertson, 2002; Carroll and Carroll, 2009), these results have not been able to be fully replicated in controlled clinical trials (Stults and Hashisaki, 1983; Gomolin et al., 1985; Soontornpun et al., 2020) which suggests that patient specific characteristics such as altered drug clearance prior to immunization may also be required for notable observation of changes in CYP soon after immunization (Meredith et al., 1985). To date, the impact of boosting doses of a vaccine has not been investigated in the clinic nor in animal models of drug metabolism.
Different COVID-19 vaccines may alter CYP enzymes in different ways. Studies in which the Ebola Zaire glycoprotein was expressed from a recombinant adenovirus vaccine (similar in approach to the Janssen and Astra Zeneca COVID-19 vaccines) found that hepatic CYP enzymes were mildly suppressed in mice 24 hours after immunization and resolved by 48 hours (JonssonSchmunk et al., 2021). Treatment with glycoprotein alone at concentrations found in the circulation of immunized individuals significantly induced CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes while treatment with a H1N1 human influenza virus almost completely shut down CYP expression and activity. Influenza held such a profound effect on CYP through its ability to control RNA translation capacity within the cell during active infection. This, paired with the fact that specific components of the lipid nanoparticles in which the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were formulated triggered a broad inflammatory response (Jonsson-Schmunk et al., 2021; Kenigsberg et al., 2022; Padin-Gonzalez et al., 2022; Szebeni et al., 2022; Tahtinen et al., 2022) suggests that these vaccines have the potenital to significantly impact hepatic and renal CYP mediated drug metabolism. This is just starting to be reported in the clinic as demonstrated through the

clozapine case report in the previous section. Further study of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunization are currently underway in relevant animal models of disease that also correlate with human CYP expression and activity patterns (Tiwari et al., 2022).
Role of the Innate Immune System in COVID-19 Infections and the Dispositon of Complex Drugs (W.C.Z and M.H.).
The innate immune system is involved in the recognition, uptake and clearance of a wide range of pathogens and substances, such as bacteria, viruses, nanoparticles, and biologics (Lucas et al., 2015; Madden et al., 2017; Lucas et al., 2018). Antigen presenting cells of the innate immune system are the first line of contact and mediators of the immune response against the viruses, such as the coronavirus (Fig. 5) (Arancibia et al., 2007; Takeuchi and Akira, 2009). There is high variability in the infection rate, severity and response to treatment of COVID-19 (Kakodkar et al., 2020; Zimmer, 2020; Rahman et al., 2021). The most severe cases of COVID-19 appear to include an over-reactive or hyper-inflamed immune response in the lungs that lead to severe pneumonitis and death.
Drug metabolism and disposition can be altered by the innate immune system, which is the primary pharmacokinetic clearance pathway for complex drugs (e.g. nanoparticles, conjugates, and biologics) (Lucas et al., 2015; Lucas et al., 2018). Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections may have altered innate immune system function and phenotypes, which alters the recognition, uptake and clearance of nanoparticles and biologics putting them at higher risk for sub-optimal response or drug related toxicities. This section describes factors that alter the function of the innate

immune system, the interaction between the innate immune system and complex drugs, and the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the innate immune system and alteration of the pharmacokinetics of complex drugs, such as Pegylated (PEG)-liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil®) and monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs).
Biomarkers of Innate Immune System (innate immune system). There is a high (~10-fold) inter-patient variability in the phenotype of function (e.g., phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species generation) and surface receptors (e.g., FcRs) of innate immune system cells in blood and tissues (Lucas et al., 2015; Lucas et al., 2018). This variability in the innate immune system biomarkers is associated with high variability in immune response and pharmacology of nanoparticles, viral drug carriers and antibodies that are identified and taken up by the innate immune system cells (Lucas et al., 2015; Madden et al., 2017; Lucas et al., 2018). Moreover, the increased severity and death rate of COVID-19 in male patients and overweight patients are consistent with our results of higher innate immune system function as measured by the biomarkers in these patient groups (Zamboni et al., 2009; La-Beck et al., 2012; Klang et al., 2020; Papadopoulos et al., 2021). Thus, we hypothesized that interactions between the SARsCoV-2 virus and the innate immune system will alter the function of the innate immune system and change the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of complex drugs, such as PEGliposomal doxorubicin and antibodies/ADCs.
Effect of SARs-CoV-2 infection on innate immune system Function and pharmacokinetics of PEG-liposomal doxorubicin in Mice. Viral load and biomarkers of the innate immune system were evaluated on day 2 and 4 in MA-10 mouse adapted SAR-CoV-2 in wild type BALB/c mice (n=4/time point) infected with and without SARS-CoV-2 virus (Leist et al., 2020).

Viral load was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Geng et al., 2021). Biomarkers of innate immune system function in blood (phagocytosis of monocytes) was evaluated using previously validated and published methods (Caron et al., 2013; Lucas et al., 2017). Previously published models describing the relationship between innate immune system function (phagocytosis of monocytes in blood) and the disposition of PEG-liposomal doxorubicin in plasma was used to simulate the plasma pharmacokinetic disposition of PEG-liposomal doxorubicin in mice with and without SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus load on days 2 and 4 after infection were 1,493,750 ± 379,487 and 209,000 ± 321,775 plaque forming units, respectively. Phagocytic function was similar in infected and non-infected mice on day 2 post infection (p > 0.05). However, on day 4 post infection the phagocytic function was 2.3-fold higher in the infected mice (67,425 ± 18,379 mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) compared to non-infected mice (29,283 ± 4,338 MFI) (p < 0.001). Interestingly on day 4 post infection, there appears to be a slight inverse relationship between viral load and phagocytic function in monocytes in blood (Fig. 6). Thus, the amount of viral load may also affect the degree of change in innate immune system function and change in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of complex drugs. Based on our prior studies measuring and modeling the relationship between phagocytic function of monocytes in blood and the pharmacokinetics of PEG-liposomal doxorubicin in plasma of mice and humans, pharmacokinetic simulations predict that the 2.3-fold higher phagocytic function in infected mice will increase PEG-liposomal doxorubicin clearance by ~2-fold and decrease the plasma exposure of PEG-liposomal doxorubicin by at least half compared to non-infected mice (Fig. 7). These results strongly suggest that COVID-19 infection alters the function of the innate immune system, which would then alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of complex drugs,

such as PEG-liposomal doxorubicin. Thus, the doses of complex drugs designed for non-infected patients may not be optimal for patients with COVID-19.
Impact and Future Directions. The ultimate goal of this research is to translate the biomarkers of the innate immune system evaluated in this study into novel clinical tests that predict variability and changes in innate immune system function in patients with and without COVID19 and other types of infections. These results can then be used to optimize the dose of complex drugs in these patient populations. Ongoing studies are evaluating the pharmacokinetic dispositon of PEG-liposomal doxorubicin in plasma and tissue (e.g., liver, spleen, and lung, which are the primary organs of the innate immune system and depot sites for complex drugs, such as PEGliposomal doxorubicin) in mice without and with infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus to validate the simulated plasma pharmacokinetic results and to evaluate the disposition PEG-liposomal doxorubicin in tissues. In addition, other biomarkers of PEG-liposomal doxorubicin and innate immune system function and phenotype in blood, liver, spleen, and lungs are also being evaluated for other complex drugs including antibodies and ADCs.
It is important to understand the acute (e.g., a few days post infection), late (e.g., weeks post infection), and prolonged (e.g., months to years) effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the function of the innate immune system and alteration in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of complex drugs (Healey et al., 2022). It is also important to understand these effects in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who may be more likely to undergo treatment for their underlying disease (Gao et al., 2021). As the COVID-19 vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are nanoparticle or carrier agents, it would be important to understand how these and other nanoparticle based vaccines alter the innate immune system and potentially the

pharmacokinetic dispositon, efficacy, and toxicity of complex drugs in the general population, but especially in high risk populations, such as obese or immune suppressed patients, that may already have an altered innate immune system (Meo et al., 2021).
Infection during pregnancy downregulates the expression of amino acid transporters in rat and human placentas (E.R.M and M.P-M.)
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 and resulting COVID-19 carries an increased risk during pregnancy. Pregnant women who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 have an increased risk of severe COVID19, including increased risk of hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and requiring mechanical ventilation (Safadi et al., 2022). Moreover, despite the fact that risk of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be under 5%, maternal infection during pregnancy also increases the risk of negative fetal outcomes including preterm birth, decreased birth weight, fetal distress in labour, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and stillbirth (Giuliani et al., 2022; Safadi et al., 2022). Additionally, it is possible that prenatal SARS-CoV-2 infection may have long-term implications for offspring neurodevelopment. It is well established that various bacterial and viral infections, when contracted during pregnancy, increase the chance of the offspring having a neurodevelopmental disorder such as autism spectrum disorder or schizophrenia (Sorensen et al., 2009; Atladttir et al., 2010; Brown and Derkits, 2010; Jiang et al., 2016; Giuliani et al., 2022). Emerging evidence suggests that offspring resulting from pregnancies complicated by COVID-19 may exhibit developmental delays, implying that SARSCoV-2 infection may similarly increase the chance of neurodevelopmental disorders (Edlow et al., 2022). However, as with the other infections linked to changes in offspring neurodevelopment, how infection during pregnancy alters fetal brain development is unclear.

The gold standard model for investigating the link between viral infection during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental changes involves rodents receiving prenatal administration of the synthetic, double-stranded RNA molecule polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)). Poly(I:C) stimulates toll-like receptor 3, the same receptor stimulated by many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (Bortolotti et al., 2021). While SARS-CoV-2 also stimulates toll-like receptor 7 (which senses single strand RNA), an animal model of toll-like receptor 7 agonism during pregnancy has yet to be extensively characterized. Administration of poly(I:C) during pregnancy results in altered behaviour and neurobiology in rodent offspring that are consistent with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia (Careaga et al., 2017; Haddad et al., 2020). Using the poly(I:C) rodent model, studies have concluded that the link between prenatal infection and neurodevelopmental disorders is due to activation of the maternal immune system itself, termed "maternal immune activation", as opposed to the presence of a particular pathogen. However, how maternal immune activation alters fetal brain development remains unknown.
A potential link between maternal immune activation and neurodevelopmental changes may lie in changes to transport of essential nutrients across the placenta. During pregnancy, the placenta supports fetal development by acting as a protective barrier between maternal and fetal circulation and facilitating exchange of nutrients and waste. To support both functions, the placenta expresses a number of ATP-binding cassette and solute carrier drug and nutrient transporters (Lager and Powell, 2012; Dallmann et al., 2019). Inflammation and infection has been shown to alter expression of drug transporters in the placenta (Petrovic and Piquette-Miller, 2010; Evers et al., 2018), resulting in altered fetal drug exposure (Petrovic and Piquette-Miller,

2015). In contrast, the impact of infection or inflammation on placental nutrient transporters is less well characterized.
Amino acid transport across the placenta is best conceived as a systems approach, in which the concerted effort of accumulative transporters, exchangers, and facilitated transporters with overlapping substrate specificity drive a net transport of amino acids from maternal to fetal circulation (Cleal et al., 2018). Amino acid transporters are also expressed in the fetal brain at the blood-brain barrier, where they facilitate amino acid transport into and out of the fetal brain (Campos-Bedolla et al., 2014), as well as at neuronal synapses, where they help regulate neurotransmission (Nguyen et al., 2022). Regulation of amino acid transport across the placenta and throughout the fetal brain is essential, as amino acids are required for fetal brain development (McDonald and Johnston, 1990; Kurbat and Lelevich, 2009; Tabatabaie et al., 2010; Tochitani, 2017). As such, changes in placental or fetal brain amino acid transport could alter fetal access to the amino acids required for neurodevelopment and contribute to a neurodevelopmental disorder. Indeed, amino acid dysregulation has been implicated in both autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia (Bala et al., 2016; Saleem et al., 2017).
We therefore hypothesized that maternal immune activation associated with prenatal viral infections could alter placental and fetal brain amino acid transporter expression, which could alter brain development. To test this hypothesis, we used the rat poly(I:C) model of maternal immune activation which is known to cause neurodevelopmental changes in offspring (Haddad et al., 2020). At 24-48 hours after poly(I:C) administration, significant decreases in the expression of alanine serine cysteine transporter 1 (ASCT1) and excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) were found in the placenta, with a similar trend for the small neutral amino acid

transporter 2 (SNAT2) (McColl and Piquette-Miller, 2019) (Table 1). Poly(I:C) also imposed significant decreases in the expression of SNAT5, EAAT1, and glycine transporter 1 (GLYT1) in fetal brain. Interestingly, inherited deficiencies in ASCT1, EAAT1 or 2, and GLYT1 are associated with neurological changes in humans (Yahyaoui and Prez-Fras, 2020). HPLC analysis of the fetal brains also revealed significant changes in tissue concentrations of multiple amino acids (McColl and Piquette-Miller, 2019). Of note, poly(I:C)-mediated maternal immune activation altered the levels of several amino acids required for proper brain development. This included a significant decrease in taurine, which is necessary for optimal neuronal proliferation (Tochitani, 2017), as well as significant decreases in glycine and gaba aminobutyric acid (GABA), two neurotransmitters that help regulate fetal brain development (Tochitani, 2017). Moreover, some of the affected amino acids have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, decreased serum taurine levels have been proposed as a biomarker for autism spectrum disorder (Park et al., 2017) and altered GABAergic function has been implicated in both autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia (Lewis et al., 2005; Cetin et al., 2015). Therefore, placental, and fetal brain amino acid transport are altered in a rat model of viral infection that is associated with changes in offspring neurodevelopment.
We next sought to determine whether similar changes occur in human pregnancies complicated by infection. To do so, we obtained human placentas collected at term from pregnancies complicated by chorioamnionitis or suspected active infection of unknown origin, and gestational age-matched controls. Chorioamnionitis is characterized by inflammation of pregnancy tissues, including the placenta, typically as a result of an ascending bacterial infection (Cappelletti et al., 2020). Placentas in the suspected infection group were from individuals who had not had an official diagnosis of infection, but were experiencing symptoms such as fever, chills, or elevated

white blood cell count when they delivered. In line with what we saw in poly(I:C)-treated rats, suspected infection was associated with a significant decrease in membrane protein expression of ASCT1, and a trend towards 50% downregulation of SNAT2 in human placentas (McColl and Piquette-Miller, 2022) (Table 1). In contrast, ASCT1, EAAT2, and SNAT2 expression were unchanged in chorioamnionitis placentas. As many of these individuals were prescribed antibiotics earlier in pregnancy, it is likely that the infection and inflammation were resolved before their placentas were collected at term.
Overall, our results demonstrate that a viral model of maternal immune activation in rats which is known to alter offspring neurodevelopment also exhibits altered placental and fetal brain amino acid transport (McColl and Piquette-Miller, 2019). These changes are also partially recapitulated in placentas from humans experiencing an active infection (McColl and Piquette-Miller, 2022). Given the importance of amino acids during fetal brain development and their implications in disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, these changes could contribute to the link between viral infection during pregnancy and offspring neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, our results demonstrate that subsequent research needs to not only consider how SARSCoV-2 infection may impact the transport or metabolism of xenobiotics, but also endogenous nutrients, particularly in the context of infection during pregnancy. Whether prenatal SARS-CoV2 infection will be associated with increases in offspring neurodevelopmental disorders remains to be seen, but long-term follow-up studies tracking neurodevelopment after prenatal COVID-19 are taking place.

Discussion Emerging research indicates that interactions between SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination on hepatic CYP metabolism is possible and can lead to reduced metabolism of small molecule drugs. Furthermore, through effects on the innate immune system, alteration in the metabolism of complex drugs (e.g. liposomal formulations) are also possible. Despite these advances, there remain several gaps in understanding that should be addressed with future research. There is a need to better understand in which situations and for which drugs these interactions could impact drug safety and effectiveness and if modifications in drug dosing or therapeutic monitoring are required. Additional studies to evaluate the interactions between SARs-CoV-2 and other aspects of drug disposition such as effects on blood-brain barrier drug transporters and renal tubule transporters, and the respective impact on central nervous system drug distribution and renal drug elimination are required. Research is needed to determine if altered drug disposition persists in individuals with long COVID and if this contributes to observed symptoms associated with long COVID. Additional research on novel mRNA and adenoviral vaccine technologies including booster doses and impacts on the disposition of other drug therapies is also required. Until these questions are answered it is important to remain aware that SARS-CoV-2 infection mediated interactions with the hepatic CYP metabolism are possible and a potential source of variability in drug responses.

Figure. 2. Aggregate illustration of clinical and laboratory findings in a case of delirium developing four days after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Laboratory findings relevant to the diagnostic process are illustrated in graphs, the computed tomography scan shows evidence of an unsuspected structural brain abnormality, normal pressure hydrocephalus. Figure abbreviations: neutrophils (PMN), lymphocytes (lym), 3 months prior to vaccination baseline (-3mon), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and pre-vaccination (pre-vacc).
Figure 3: Time Course of SARS-CoV-2 Infection with Respect to Severity of Disease: Virus Shedding, Inflammatory Phase, Symptom Development and Therapies. Note the inflammatory phase lasts approximately 15 days in mild cases and is more amplified and extensive in severe cases suggesting that CYP mediated metabolism could be altered for extensive periods of time even with mild infections.

signaling pathways that can suppress CYP expression and function. Talin can engage integrins from the cytoplasm and alter CYP through inside out signaling pathways. C. Suppression of Talin in human hepatocytes increases CYP activity suggesting that this protein, which supports SARS-CoV-2 infection, plays a notable role in the regulation of CYP.
Figure 5: The Innate immune system is the first line of defense against pathogens, such as viruses. The innate immune system response activates adaptive immune processes through Tolllike receptors (TLRs) and antigen presentation. Innate immune cells recognize and phagocytose pathogens that promote cytokine & antigen presentation to T cells. In addition, these same innate immune cells are directly involved in the identification, uptake, and clearance of complex drugs (e.g., nanoparticles, conjugates, and biologics).
Figure 6: The relationship between viral load measured by plaque-forming units (PFU) and phagocytic function (mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) of monocytes in blood of infected mice on day 4 post infection. There is a slight inversion relationship between viral load and phagocytic function. Thus, the amount of viral load may also affect the degree of change in innate immune system function and change in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic disposition of complex drugs.

Abstract
The covid-19 vaccine confers direct protection and reduces transmission rates of the virus and new variants. Vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and CoronaVac have been cleared for children in Brazil. They are safe, effective, and immunogenic. There are no known complications associated with the use of steroids or vaccines in pediatric patients with covid-19 and nephrotic syndrome. With or without immunosuppression, these patients are not at increased risk of severe covid-19, and steroids are safe for them. A milder form of covid-19 occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease without the need for hospitalization. The vaccine response may be reduced and/or the duration of antibodies after vaccination may be shorter than in the general population. However, considering risk of exposure, vaccination against covid-19 is recommended. It is believed that patients with hemolytic-uremic syndrome are at higher risk of severe covid-19. Vaccination is recommended, although specific data on the safety and efficacy of the covid-19 vaccine are limited. There is agreement that the benefits of induced immunity outweigh the risks of immunization. Vaccination against covid-19 is recommended for children and adolescents needing kidney transplantation or who have undergone transplantation. These patients present decreased immune response after vaccination, but immunization is recommended because the benefits outweigh the risks of vaccination. Current recommendations in Brazil stipulate the use of the messenger RNA vaccine. This paper aims to provide pediatric nephrologists with the latest knowledge about vaccination against covid-19 for children with kidney disease.

Resumo
A vacina covid-19 confere proteção direta, reduz as taxas de transmissão do vírus e de novas variantes. No Brasil, estão liberadas para a população pediátrica as vacinas Pfizer/BioNTech e a CoronaVac, ambas seguras, eficazes e imunogênicas. Pacientes pediátricos com síndrome nefrótica e covid-19 têm curso clínico regular sem complicações relacionadas ao uso de esteroides ou vacinas. Esses pacientes, com ou sem imunossupressão, não apresentam maior risco de covid-19 grave e o tratamento com esteroides é seguro. Os pacientes com doença renal crônica têm covid-19 mais leve, sem necessidade de hospitalização. A resposta vacinal pode ser reduzida e/ou a duração dos anticorpos pós-vacinação pode ser menor do que na população geral. Entretanto, a vacina covid-19 está recomendada, considerando o risco de exposição. Acredita-se que pacientes com síndrome hemolítico-urêmica teriam maior risco de covid-19 grave. A vacina é recomendada, embora dados específicos sobre segurança e eficácia da vacina covid-19 sejam limitados. Há concordância que os benefícios da imunidade induzida superam quaisquer riscos da imunização. A vacina covid-19 é recomendada para crianças e adolescentes candidatos ao transplante renal ou já transplantados. Esses pacientes têm resposta imunológica reduzida após a vacina, entretanto ela é recomendada porque os benefícios superam qualquer risco dessa vacinação. A recomendação atual no Brasil é a vacina de tecnologia RNA mensageiro. O objetivo deste documento é levar aos nefrologistas pediátricos os conhecimentos mais recentes sobre a vacinação contra contra-19 em crianças com doenças renais.

Vaccination against covid-19: kidney disease and immunosuppressant therapy

Introduction
Covid-19 was first detected in December 2019 in Hubei (Wuhan) province, China. The virus has spread rapidly around the world, and by March 2022, 29 million cases of covid-19 and 652,000 deaths from the disease had been confirmed in Brazil1. In that same period, 6,531 cases of pediatric severe acute respiratory syndrome due to covid-19 and 1,503 cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children with 93 deaths had been confirmed2,3.
A large proportion of children with covid-19 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, and the presence of comorbid conditions is considered a risk factor. A Brazilian study showed that 41% of children admitted to intensive care units had comorbid conditions4.
There are few reports on the risk of severe disease from covid-19 in immunocompromised pediatric patients. Population studies have shown that children and adolescents are exposed to the virus in a similar way to adults and are potential vectors in disease transmission5.
The covid-19 vaccine confers direct protection, reduces the rates of virus transmission and the emergence of new variants6. Lv et al. have demonstrated the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of these vaccines in healthy pediatric populations. Adverse events are rare and mild, and benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks7.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines (BNT162b2), authorized for children aged five years and older, and CoronaVac, authorized for children aged six years and older, are currently approved in Brazil. CoronaVac (Sinovac) is a vaccine with inactivated virus. The Pfizer-BioNTech covid-19 (BNT162b2) vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle of nucleoside-modified mRNA that enables the expression of SARS-CoV-2 protein S on the cell surface. It causes the activation of cytotoxic and helper T-cells and induction of humoral immunity, thereby producing neutralizing antibodies. Both vaccines are safe, effective, and immunogenic.
The most common adverse events in children and adolescents are injection site pain, fever, headache, and fatigue. Most of these events were not serious and deaths have not been reported7. Rare cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis have been reported in association with the administration of the second dose of the covid-19 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine after

a short interval from the first dose (< 30 days), but no deaths have been attributed to these complications7.
Chart 1 shows the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the recommendations for the vaccination against covid-19 for each category of pediatric patients with kidney disease.
Covid-19 and Covid-19 Vaccination in Children and Adolescents with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS)
Most children with idiopathic NS relapse or are steroid-dependent, and require chronic use of immunosuppressants. Urinary loss of endogenous antibodies during NS decompensation and immunosuppressant therapy increase the risk of infections8. Evidence points to immune system dysregulation involving B and T cells as part of the pathophysiology of NS, suggesting that vaccines may promote disease recurrence via the induction of immune response.
To date, there have been few reports of NS associated with covid-19 infection. A systematic review about covid-19 in patients with NS concluded that, with or without immunosuppressant therapy, patients were not at increased risk of severe covid-19, steroid treatment was safe, and the incidence of disease recurrence remained unchanged9. On the other hand, a study performed in New Delhi showed that patients with decompensated NS had a sixfold risk of developing severe complications during covid-19, such as severe acute kidney injury, shock, respiratory failure, encephalopathy, or death10. Cases of NS from minimal injuries triggered after vaccination against covid-19 involving adults and one adolescent have been reported8,11. Recommendations for vaccination are mostly based on expert opinions, considering the lack of controlled studies.
Immunosuppressant therapy for children and adolescents during the pandemic9
I) Continue ongoing treatment, advising parents to report SARS-CoV-2 infection or related symptoms.
II) Initiate or intensify immunosuppressant therapy as needed, without concerns related to covid-19.
III) These patients do not require more stringent protective measures compared to their healthy peers.

Covid-19 infection in children and adolescents with NS
I) For children with covid-19 in remission, treatment must be the same as the one given to healthy children and preventive hospitalization is not needed. Signs of recurrence must be monitored and, in cases of severe disease, hospitalization and reduction of immunosuppressant therapy must be considered.
II) In cases of mild or asymptomatic infection, maintain ongoing treatment with immuno­ suppressants; immediate hospitalization should be avoided. Monitor for signs of recurrence.
NS recurrence in children and adolescents
I) Recurrent disease is treated with corticosteroids; there is no reason to delay the initiation of therapy.
II) For covid-19-related recurrent disease, the usual protocol must be enforced.

Recommendations regarding covid-19 vaccines for children and adolescents with NS
I) Vaccinate all patients with NS, following the age limits established by regulatory agencies.
II) Signs of recurrence must be monitored after vaccination;
III) Vaccines must not be administered to individuals with recurring disease.
IV) Every immunosuppressed patient over the age of 12 must have the third dose of the vaccine and receive the fourth dose four months later.
V) In the case of ongoing anti-CD20 therapy (rituximab), vaccination must be postponed for at least six months after treatment cessation.
Covid-19 Vaccines for Children and Adolescents with NS on Rituximab The response to vaccination in patients taking rituximab is reduced. Thus, properly timing the

administration of vaccines is necessary. Extending the interval between doses or discontinuing rituximab infusions allows immature B-cells to recover and proper vaccine response while levels of memory (pathogenic) B-cells remain low. An alternative strategy is to vaccinate patients at least four weeks prior to rituximab infusion or 12 to 20 weeks after the end of the infusion cycle. Monitoring the effect of rituximab from CD19 lymphocyte levels allows the discontinuation of the drug in asymptomatic and selected patients, which allows the definition of the time needed to improve response to vaccination. Rituximab infusions can be resumed four weeks after completing the vaccination scheme12,13.
Covid-19 and Vaccination Against Covid-19 in Children and Adolescents with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis
There are few studies about covid-19 in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and on dialysis (peritoneal dialysis, PD, or hemodialysis, HD). These studies report the occurrence of milder disease and no need for hospitalization13,14. On the other hand, Aimen et al. found that CKD was the most common comorbid condition in symptomatic children and adolescents. One of the three deaths reported in their study involved a patient on PD15. In Brazil, one of the countries with the highest number of deaths by covid-19 in the pediatric age group, there is no specific data about patients on dialysis.
The usual vaccination schedule is recommended for children and adolescents, with special attention to vaccines with attenuated virus, which are contraindicated after renal transplantation. Vaccine response in CKD patients may be reduced and/or antibodies may be active for shorter periods of time than in the general population16. Nonetheless, given the risk of exposure, vaccination against covid-19 is recommended. It is also important that family members of dialysis patients get the full vaccination regimen, especially those with children under five years of age.
There is no evidence regarding the efficacy of covid-19 vaccines in pediatric patients on dialysis. In the Netherlands, the RECOVAC consortium (REnal patients COvid-19 VACcination), a prospective cohort study including dialysis patients older than 18 years, was organized to evaluate the efficacy of

covid-19 vaccines in patients with CKD stages 4 and 5 and after kidney transplantation, comparing them with unvaccinated controls17.
Zitt et al. evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 vaccine in HD patients. They found local reactions in 38% after the first dose, while 29.2% had mild reactions after the second dose (2.1% moderate; 2.1% serious adverse events). Systemic events occurred rarely, and the most frequent were diarrhea (4% mild; 4% moderate) and fatigue (8% mild). After the first dose, 42% developed adequate vaccine response as assessed by IgG levels against anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein18. After the second dose, seroconversion was observed in 97.2% and was correlated with prior hepatitis B seroconversion and age (younger patients). Patients who had local reactions tended to have higher levels of protective antibodies. Conversely, patients on immunosuppressants during the study had lower levels of protective antibodies18.
Shashar et al. discussed the administration of the third dose in individuals on HD. The authors observed that the group that received the booster, compared to controls, had higher levels of protective antibodies, despite being older and having a greater incidence of hypertension. Serologic response was inversely associated with levels of inflammation markers and malnutrition. A drop in protective antibodies levels was observed eight months after vaccination in the group that did not receive booster shots19. This observation contributed to the discussion of the need for a third dose in individuals on HD20. AngelKorman et al. confirmed this need, while others have wondered whether vaccination of individuals on HD should be considered on an individual basis21,22.
Based on study findings, some medical societies have presented specific recommendations for pediatric patients on dialysis. The British Association for Pediatric Nephrology (BAPN) recommends that covid-19 booster be given only to adolescents with CKD older than 12 years23. The EUDIAL working group of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association (2021) stated that adult patients and children alike should be vaccinated against covid-1924.
Covid-19 infection in children and adolescents with CKD and on dialysis
I) Use the same treatment given to healthy children without the need for preventive hospitalization.

II) In case of mild or asymptomatic infection, maintain treatment; immediate hospitalization should be avoided.

Recommendations to vaccinate children and adolescents with CKD and on dialysis against covid-19

I) Vaccinate all pediatric patients with CKD and on dialysis, following the age limits set by regulatory agencies.

II) Vaccinate preferably with an mRNA vaccine, in accordance with age restrictions.

III) Family members of patients on dialysis and with CKD must comply with the complete vaccination scheme, especially those with children under the age of five years.

IV) All immunosuppressed patients over 12 years of age must take the third dose of the vaccine and the fourth dose four months later.

Covid-19 and Covid-19 Vaccination in Children and Adolescents with Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (aHUS)
aHUS is a microangiopathic disorder whose pathophysiology overlaps with the cytokine storm observed in severe covid-1925. This shared pathophysiology suggests that patients with aHUS are at increased risk of developing severe covid-19, regardless of the status of the treatment for aHUS, including individuals previously diagnosed with covid-1926. The recommendation is that these patients are immunized against covid-1927,28. Although specific safety and efficacy data on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is limited, there is agreement that the benefits of induced immunity outweigh the risks tied to immunization29. In Brazil, the use of live inactive virus vaccines (CoronaVac/Sinovac) has not been authorized for immunosuppressed patients27. Since aHUS is a serious condition, it has been excluded from the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccine trials. Thus, it is unclear whether currently available vaccines are as effective for these patients as they were for the studied populations30,31. There is no data to suggest that the available vaccines are less effective or less safe for individuals with aHUS than for the general population.

Covid-19 infection in children and adolescents with aHUS
I) Maintain treatment; no need for preventive hospitalization. In case of severe infection, consider hospitalization and discontinuation of treatment.
II) In cases of mild or asymptomatic infection, maintain treatment; immediate hospitalization should be avoided.
Recommendations for covid-19 vaccination in children and adolescents with aHUS
I) Vaccinate all pediatric patients with aHUS, following the age limits set by regulatory agencies.
II) Children and adolescents with a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of vaccine or to one of its components should not be vaccinated31.
III) Family members of patients diagnosed with aHUS must comply with the full vaccination scheme, especially family members of children aged less than five years.
IV) In case of comorbid conditions, vaccination must be postponed in individuals with severe acute fever or acute infection.
V) In case of mild infection and/or low fever, do not postpone vaccination.
VI) In patients with thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders, the vaccine must be administered with caution as in other intramuscular injections, with risk of local hematoma.
Patients on eculizumab should be vaccinated as close as possible to the day of drug infusion (days before or days after) because of the theoretical possibility that such approach might reduce the chance of disease exacerbation related to vaccine administration29.
Covid-19 vaccines can be given concurrently or at any time before or after any other indicated vaccine29. This is a change from the previous recommendation, which called for a 14-day interval before or after receiving a covid-19 vaccine. The basis for this change in recommendation stems from general administrative guidance for vaccines and guidance from the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)28.

Vaccination against covid-19: kidney disease and immunosuppressant therapy

Covid-19 and Covid-19 Vaccination in Children and Adolescents Undvergoing Kidney Transplantation
The covid-19 pandemic has negatively impacted pediatric transplantation in Brazil and affected areas such as outpatient care, monitoring, transdisciplinary care, medication, patient/family education/support, schooling, employment, and care of pediatric kidney transplant patients diagnosed with covid-19.
Vaccination against covid-19 is recommended for all individuals, including children and adolescents waiting for kidney transplantation or transplant patients, as authorized by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health32. In suspected or confirmed cases, vaccination must not be performed during the quarantine period27,33. In Brazil, the current recommendation is to use the Comirnaty (PfizerBioNTech) messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine for immunosuppressed patients with an ideal interval of eight weeks between the first and second doses, in individuals aged 5 to 17 years27.
The covid-19 vaccine causes reduced immune response in solid organ transplant recipients when compared to immunocompetent individuals34. Studies in adult recipients have shown that vaccination led to a reduction of almost 80% in the incidence of symptomatic covid-19 compared to unvaccinated recipients35. Unfortunately, studies in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients are limited. Qin et al. showed that 73% of pediatric patients had a positive antibody response after two doses of mRNA vaccine36. Experience with other vaccines has shown that they continue to provide substantial protection against infections and more severe disease in this vulnerable population and should be recommended before and after transplantation35. Considering this experience, covid-19 vaccination for all solid organ recipients is recommended37,38.
Covid-19 infection in pediatric kidney transplant recipients
I) Maintain the same treatment given to healthy children, with no need for preventive hospitalization. In case of severe covid-19 infection, consider hospitalization.
II) In case of mild or asymptomatic infection, maintain treatment; hospitalization should be avoided.

Recommendations vaccinating children and adolescents undergoing kidney transplantation against covid-19
I) Vaccinate all pediatric kidney transplant patients, following the age limits set by regulatory agencies.
II) Use preferably an mRNA vaccine, following age restrictions.
III) Family members of renal transplant patients must comply with the full vaccination scheme, especially family members of children aged less than five years39.
IV) In suspected or confirmed cases, do not vaccinate during the quarantine period;
V) Kidney transplant recipients should receive any of the available covid-19 vaccines based on age and eligibility criteria.
VI) The optimal time to begin vaccination or complete the vaccination scheme after transplantation is unclear. Experts recommend waiting at least one month after transplantation to allow for a more robust immune response.
VII) All immunosuppressed patients over the age of 12 must have the third dose of the vaccine and the fourth dose four months later.
VIII) Contraindications to the mRNA vaccine for solid organ recipients are the same as the general population: · Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or to any of the excipients of the vaccine. · Confirmed anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of a covid-19 vaccine.
IX) Postpone vaccination in individuals with severe acute fever or acute infection. Mild infection and/or low-grade fever should NOT cause postponement of vaccination.
X) In patients with thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders, administer the vaccine with caution, as with other intramuscular injections, with risk of local hematoma;
XI) Do not postpone kidney transplantation for kidney transplant candidates. They can receive the vaccine and do not need to wait for the procedure.

Vaccination against covid-19: kidney disease and immunosuppressant therapy

XII) After transplant, the interval to start or complete the vaccination scheme is 30 days.
XIII) Do not change the immunosuppressants in use; postpone vaccination if the patient has acute fever.
XIV) After vaccination, wear face masks, practice social distancing, and clean hands frequently.
Final Considerations
Covid-19 causes mild symptoms or is asymptomatic in the majority of pediatric patients with CKD, on immunosuppressants due to glomerular disease, or undergoing renal transplantation.
In this group of individuals, vaccination against covid-19 is very important, since it confers direct protection and prevention against the disease. Vaccines reduce virus transmission rates and the emergence of new variants. Adverse events are rare and mild, and the benefits outweigh the risks.
Immunocompromised patients may not develop sufficient immune response after two doses of the vaccine. Studies recommend additional vaccines to improve response. Acceptance of the covid-19 vaccine is necessary to limit the risk that the disease poses to patients40.

Background: Countries worldwide are focusing to mitigate the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by employing public health measures. Laboratories have a key role in the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Serology for SARS-CoV-2 is of critical importance to support diagnosis, define the epidemiological framework and evaluate immune responses to natural infection and vaccine administration. Aim: The aim of this study was the assessment of the actual capability among laboratories involved in sero-epidemiological studies on COVID-19 in EU/EEA and EU enlargement countries to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies through an external quality assessment (EQA) based on proficiency testing. Methods: The EQA panels were composed of eight different, pooled human serum samples (all collected in 2020 before the vaccine roll-out), addressing sensitivity and specificity of detection. The panels and two EU human SARS-CoV-2 serological standards were sent to 56 laboratories in 30 countries. Results: The overall performance of laboratories within this EQA indicated a robust ability to establish past SARS-CoV-2 infections via detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, with 53 of 55 laboratories using at least one test that characterised all EQA samples correctly. IgM-specific test methods provided most incorrect sample characterisations (24/208), while test methods detecting total immunoglobulin (0/119) and neutralising antibodies (2/230) performed the best. The semiquantitative assays used by the EQA participants also showed a robust performance in relation to the standards. Conclusion: Our EQA showed a high capability across

Key public health message
What did you want to address in this study? Robust serological test systems to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human serum samples are important to establish whether past infections occurred and to assess the extent of immunity in the population. We want to enable laboratories and countries employing public health measures to assess the quality and robustness of different serological tests that are being used in European expert laboratories. What have we learnt from this study? The majority of laboratories (53 of 55) used at least one serological test that was able to characterise all the serum samples correctly. The performance of serological assays varied for different types of antibodies. What are the implications of your findings for public health? Our study showed a high capability across European reference laboratories for reliable diagnostics for SARSCoV-2 antibody responses. Aside from assessing the total share of people with immunity in the population, reliable serological diagnostics are also important to guide public health actions by helping to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic cases.

Introduction
Countries worldwide are focusing to mitigate the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic [1] by employing public health measures, including increasing vaccination roll-out and restriction of movements. Laboratories have a key role in the control of the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by detecting acute and previous infections with the virus in a reliable and timely fashion. While the detection of acute infections, typically done by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) or antigen (Ag) testing, can be used to stop transmission chains through isolation and quarantine measures [2], the detection of immunological markers for past SARS-CoV-2 infections and/or vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 is used to estimate immunity [3] in both individuals and communities, thereby informing mitigation strategies. Most serological assays detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as the main immunological marker. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the spike protein represents one of the main concerns for the potential of immunological escape from the antibodies response.
The vast impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public health, economies and societies drives the rapid development of numerous serological assays by laboratories and commercial entities [4]. These tests are not only based on different techniques, e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA), lateral flow assays (LFA) and virus neutralisation tests (VNT), but also use different antigenic targets and are able to detect different types of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, e.g. total immunoglobulin (Ig), IgG, IgM, IgA and/or neutralising antibodies. Besides the fact that each laboratory needs to perform validation and evaluation studies before implementing a new test [5], it is crucial to assess the capability of the laboratory to perform the test through an external quality assessment (EQA) based on proficiency testing. Proficiency testing enables a comparison of the accuracy of different tests and the performance of different laboratories based on the same material [6-10].
Here, we describe the set-up and results of such an EQA of detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among European expert laboratories that are members of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) COVID-19 and influenza laboratory networks, laboratories involved in sero-epidemiological studies on COVID-19 in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and EU-enlargement countries and/or members of the Emerging Viral Diseases-Expert Laboratory Network (EVD-LabNet). The proficiency panel comprised different isotypes of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In addition, laboratories also received two

in EU/EEA and EU-enlargement countries and/or members of the Emerging Viral Diseases-Expert Laboratory Network (EVD-LabNet) were invited to participate this EQA study. Registration was closed on 2 February 2021. Fifty-four laboratories received one EQA panel and two JRC standards between 22 February and 5 March 2021, one laboratory registered later and received the packages on 24 March 2021. The online submission form to submit EQA results was open until 8 April 2021.
Panel composition
The EQA panels were composed of eight different, fully characterised, pooled human serum samples and addressed both sensitivity and specificity of detection. Five samples contained anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, while three samples did not (Table 1). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive sera were collected from individuals with different severities of disease: mild, non-hospitalised cases (two samples that contained mixed sera from multiple patients) and severe, hospitalised cases (three samples that contained mixed sera from multiple patients). The sera from individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection were a collection of residual routine diagnostic anonymised samples and not suitable to evaluate antibody waning. The median time from infection diagnosis to sample collection was 17.5 days (range: 5-92 days). The obtained serology results for the preparation of the EQA were not used for the clinical management of the patients. All sera from individuals with a SARSCoV-2 infection were collected in 2020 before COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. The sera from individuals with acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection were collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 at the end of 2019 and were anonymised. In addition, sera from individuals with an acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection were anonymised. The anti-SARS-CoV-2-negative sera were pre-pandemic residual sera from routine diagnostics provided by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INMI) in Rome, Italy and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in Bilthoven, the Netherlands. All panel sera, including the pre-pandemic sera, contained antibodies directed against the common cold coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43; HCoV-229E; HCoV-NL63; HCoV-HKU1). In addition to the EQA panel, all participants received two human SARSCoV-2 serological standards produced and described by the JRC: EURM-017 and EURM-018 [11,12].

The freeze-dried equivalent of 0.2 mL pooled anonymised sera was prepared for each panel sample (Table 1). Samples were pooled to obtain sufficient volumes for uniform preparation of the total number of required panels. All pooled samples were heat-inactivated (56°C for 30 min) and freeze-dried in 0.2 mL aliquots (FreeZone Benchtop Freeze Dryer, LABCONCO, United States (US)). Successful virus inactivation of panel samples was confirmed by the absence of viral growth in two consecutive cell culture passages. All

samples were provided coded Sample A to Sample H, with no further identifying information given. The standards EURM-017 and EURM-018 were produced and shipped by JRC. Product information on the materials is publicly available [11,12].
Samples characterisation, testing instructions
Each sample of the EQA panel was extensively characterised by the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 reference laboratories at INMI and RIVM, using a wide variety of serological tests (tests and outcomes of the panel characterisation are provided in Supplementary Table S1). Based on this characterisation, the final composition of the EQA panels was defined (Table 1). All samples of the EQA panel, including the anti-SARS-CoV-2-negative samples (C, E and F) were determined to contain antibodies against the four common human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoVHKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63) by protein micro-array as a quantitative multiplex immunoassay [13].
The EQA panels were shipped at room temperature. The serological standards were shipped separately on dry ice. Laboratories received detailed reconstitution, testing and storage instructions with the panels, advising to centrifugate the lyophilised samples for 1 min at 3,000 rpm to sediment material which might stick to the cap, reconstitute the samples in 200µL sterile water for ca 1 h, vortex the samples for ca 10 sec to resuspend the material properly, and centrifugate the samples to spin down the reconstituted materials to avoid contamination. Laboratories were informed that the EQA panel samples consisted of inactivated, non-infectious human sera, but no specific information was provided, i.e. positivity and negativity to anti-SARS-CoV-2.
The JRC standards were ready to use upon receipt. It was advised to store the material as follows: original material of the EQA panel at room temperature (acceptable range: -20°C to +25°C), and at 4°C once the material was reconstituted; original material of the JRC standards frozen (acceptable range: -20°C to -80°C), and at 4°C once the material was thawed. Laboratories were informed that the provided standards contained anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as they received the product information sheet alongside the EQA panel.
Evaluation of results
The testing instructions provided a link to the online result submission platform. In the online submission form, laboratories were asked to give detailed information on each of the tests that they performed on the EQA panel and JRC standards, including the type of detectable antibodies. Since a the majority of serological tests only require small volumes, multiple different tests could be performed. For each method, the laboratories had to indicate whether they detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the EQA samples, the specific result of the test and how they interpreted the outcome of the test. Because laboratories had to

submit their results per specific test used, the EQA outcomes could be analysed on individual test level, as well as on laboratory level (multiple tests per laboratory). There was no minimum or maximum limit for how many tests could be assessed with the EQA panels and submitted in the online submission form.
For the purposes of this EQA, the panel outcomes with an individual test submitted by a laboratory were referred to as a `test', i.e. in total, results of 162 tests were submitted by 55 laboratories (for instance, two laboratories used seven tests to characterise the EQA samples, 16 used three tests, 10 used one test only) (Figure 1). Tests that were used by multiple laboratories that were either the same commercial test or had the same principle (e.g. VNT) were referred to as `assays', i.e. in total 53 commercial and in-house assays (Supplementary Table S2 lists the commercial and in-house tests assessed by EQA participants) were used by 55 laboratories resulting in a submission of results of 162 tests.
Statistics Data were collected and analysed in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Bellingham, US) and GraphPad Prism 9 software for Windows version 9.1.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, US). Performance of specific tests was analysed by comparison of the amount of correct vs false results, either grouped by assay type or by isotypes of detectable antibodies, using two-sided Yates' corrected chi-squared test. Results with a p value0.05 were considered statistically significant. Furthermore, Spearman's rank correlation test was used to assess correlation of EQA performance as fraction of correct results, with sample input volume as specified by the EQA participants.
Results
External quality assessment participation and overall laboratory and test performance
Fifty-six laboratories registered to participate in the EQA. In total, 55 laboratories from 30 countries, namely 27 of 30 EU/EEA countries and three of seven EU pre-accession countries, reported individual panel results representing 162 tests (Figure 1A), while one laboratory did not submit any results. The number of different tests assessed per laboratory varied between 1 and 7 (Figure 1B).
Thirty-six of 55 laboratories characterised all EQA samples correctly with all tests they assessed, while 17 additional laboratories used at least one test that identified all EQA samples correctly (Figure 1B). Only two laboratories could not identify all samples correctly (Figure 1B). On test level, 82.1% of the submitted tests (133/162) detected all tested samples correctly. While the outcome for the samples of pooled sera from hospitalised patients and for one sample of the pooled sera from mild patients (A, D, H and B) ranged between
8

98.7% and 100.0% correct results, samples C (negative pre-pandemic), E (acute CMV+EBV infection) and G (mild COVID-19, A+/G+/M+(low)) showed slightly lower proportions for correct identification ranging from 95.0% to 96.3% (Table 1). The sample with the least correct results, 88.8%, was sample F (negative prepandemic, Table 1). The correct identification proportion for the JRC standards was 94.9% for EURM-017 and 96.8% for EURM-018 (Table 1).
Assay performance
Overall, false-negative results occurred less frequently than false-positive results (Figure 1C, Table 2). Of the 161 tests, 135 (83.9%) characterised all specificity samples (C, E, F) correctly. Furthermore, we analysed assays separately for each antibody isotype they could detect when laboratories submitted these individual results. Assays for which no individual isotype results were submitted were grouped as `IgM/IgG' and `IgM/IgA' (Table 2). IgM-specific tests performed least accurately and were significantly worse at identifying samples correctly than tests detecting total immunoglobulin (Table 2). For each group, IgA, IgG or IgM, multiple assays gave at least one false outcome; respectively, two of six, seven of 32 and eight of 14 assays had at least one false result.
In total, 41 commercial assays and 12 in-house assays were used by the EQA participants (listed in Supplementary Table S2). Overall, 3.5% (37/1,058) of reported results using commercial assays and 2.6% (6/231) using in-house assays were incorrect. Of all 162 tests used by participants, 75 (46.3%) were ELISAbased, 43 (26.5%) were CLIA/chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA)/electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) tests and 22 (13.6%) VNTs. The remaining 22 (13.6%) included, among other types of tests, LFA, plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT), protein micro-array and immunofluorescence assay/ enzyme-linked fluorescence assay.
Among those assays performed by three or more EQA participants, two in-house assays (VNT, PRNT) and six commercial assays (Abbott - SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant, Beijing Wantai Biological - SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA, Euroimmun - Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA IgG, Roche - Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S, Vircell microbiologists - COVID-19 ELISA IgM+IgA and GenScript - SARSCoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralisation Test Kit) correctly characterised all EQA samples in all laboratories that assessed these assays (Table 3). None of the assays performed significantly better than the group `Other' (i.e. all tests that were used byfewer thanthree laboratories) considering two-sided Yates' corrected chisquared test. One test (Euroimmun - Anti-SARS-CoV-2 NCP ELISA IgM) performed significantly worse than `Other' (p value<0.0001) (Table 3).

Qualitative and semiquantitative results in relation to Joint Research Centre standards
Four qualitative assays in this EQA had been previously used to characterise the JRC standards as positive, both EURM-017 [11] and EURM-018 [12]: Genscript (cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralisation Antibody detection kit), Roche (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2), Abbott (SARSCoV-2 IgG) and Abbott (SARS-CoV-2 IgM). In this EQA, Genscript and Roche scored all samples correctly, while the assays of Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and SARS-CoV-2 IgM each scored one standard incorrectly (EURM-018) as negative.
Laboratories were asked to specify the exact (numerical) results of each test they used to assess how semiquantitative assays performed across different laboratories in comparison to the reference product information available for the two JRC standards. Figure 2 and Table 4 show an overview of the numerical results for all semiquantitative specific assays that were used by three or more laboratories. Notably, results of three of the semiquantitative assays, namely by Abbott (SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant), GenScript (cPass SARSCoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralisation Test Kit) and Roche (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S) characterised all EQA samples correctly; their results for the JRC standards corresponded to previous JRC characterisations (Table 4). Absolute titres obtained with the various virus neutralisation assays varied between laboratories (range: 12- to 115-fold differences).
Influence of various parameters on the performance of the external quality assessment
The vast majority of laboratories used the advised volume of 200 µL sterile water to reconstitute the EQA samples (51/55 laboratories) as well as the storage advice for both the EQA panels (54/55 laboratories) and the JRC standards (50/55 laboratories). We did not see any influence of these parameters on test performance. Although sample input volume for the different tests ranged from 1 µL to 170 µL, it did not correlate with the fraction of correct results by test (p=0.3251; Spearman correlation test).
Considering antibodies directed to different antigenic proteins targeted in the serological assays, the majority of the assays used (n=27) was based on the spike (S) protein, including recombinant full S or its specific domains (S1, S2 or receptor-binding domain). Fifteen assays used both N and S proteins, while six targeted the anti-N response only. In addition, 18 assays used whole live virus isolates for VNT/PRNT, while for three in-house assays, the viral antigen was not reported. No influence of the target protein on test results was observed.
Discussion
The overall performance of laboratories within this EQA indicated a robust ability to establish whether past SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred via detection of antiSARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All except two laboratories
10

used at least one assay that identified all samples correctly as SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive or negative. IgM-specific assays showed the most incorrect characterisations of the EQA samples. In particular, sample G (IgA+/IgG+/IgM+(low)) was missed by four of five laboratories that used the same commercial IgM-only assay (Euroimmun - Anti-SARS-CoV-2 NCP ELISA IgM) and by two additional assays that should have been able to detect the presence of IgM antibodies based on their technical specifications (AAZ - COVID-PRESTO TROD IgG/IgM; Hangzhou Biotest Biotech - RightSign COVID19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette). The remaining 20 laboratories were able to identify sample G correctly using 11 different assays. Indeed, this sample was characterised by the two reference laboratories to have IgM levels below the detection limit of some assays (find the detailed results listed in Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, eight of 14 IgM-specific assays resulted in one or more false-positive test results. Several studies have shown that in general, IgM assays have a lower sensitivity and specificity than IgG or total IgG assays [14-16]. Hence it is recommended to perform serodiagnostics on multiple isotypes simultaneously to improve the specifics of the overall diagnosis. In addition, although specific IgM antibodies can be detected as early as 4 days after infection and they can help to define the early antibody response, SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger unconventional antibody responses, with cases developing IgG before IgM or others with no IgM [17-19]. Indeed, the majority of laboratories (45/55) used more than one serological test to assess the samples. In case of result discrepancies between IgMspecific tests and tests detecting other types of immunoglobulins, laboratories should consider the timing of a potential infection, but also the higher unreliability of IgM-specific tests. Overall, test methods detecting total immunoglobulin, neutralising antibodies or IgG performed better than test methods that are IgA- or IgM-specific. Test method performance was different neither for commercial and in-house assays, nor for a specific test principle, e.g. ELISA, (s)VNT, PRNT or CLIA/ CMIA/ECLIA. This was also shown by the variety of test methods that characterised 100.0% of tested samples correctly (Table 3).
Correct characterisation of the three specificity samples (C, E and F) was more problematic than of the sensitivity samples. Variable test performance for specificity samples has been reported before [20,21]. A likely explanation is potential cross-reactivity with antibodies raised by previous infection with other human coronaviruses causing the common cold [13], as all samples in the proficiency panel of this EQA also contained antibodies against all other seasonally circulating human coronaviruses (Supplementary Table S1). If this was the case, specificity test performance would probably be further reduced in periods of high prevalence of co-circulating seasonal coronaviruses.
As expected, the absolute titres obtained with the various virus neutralisation assays varied between

laboratories as underlying protocols can vary extensively (e.g. whole viruses or pseudotype viruses, number of median tissue culture infectious dose units, incubation period and temperature, cell lines, cut-off, read-out) and this gold standard serology method is mostly used as a research tool in the virology field. A recent European study showed that indeed a substantial heterogeneity exists in neutralising antibody testing approaches, resulting in almost 100-fold differences in raw neutralising titres. However, a direct comparison was possible through harmonisation by the use of a standard defined in IU/mL, which reduced the inter-laboratory variability ca 10-fold [22]. Another study showed that the inter-laboratory variation for neutralisation tests was reduced more than 50-fold when assay outcomes were reported relative to the same (WHO) standard [23]. In our study, the results of the VNT could not be compared through normalisation as the JRC standards were defined with a titre range for neutralisation tests and not with a defined IU/mL as in the WHO standard [24].
The characterisation of the JRC standards with the semiquantitative binding assays by the EQA participants was in range with the standards product information, indicating a robust performance of these semiquantitative assays across different laboratories. The qualitative assays that were used to define the JRC standards performed similarly in the EQA as well.
Notably, all samples used in this study were obtained from patients with natural SARS-CoV-2 infections. We did not include samples from vaccinated individuals. For future sero-epidemiological surveillance studies, the capacity of serological tests to differentiate between antibodies derived from natural infections and antibodies induced by vaccination is desirable. This can be achieved by using serological tests with different antigenic targets, i.e. anti-N (natural infection only) and anti-S detection, to determine the level of natural immunity in the study population and assess the risk of vaccination not being sufficient to protect against a potentially increasing burden on the healthcare system. EQA programmes including also sera from vaccinated people would be of great interest to expand the evaluation of the accuracy of different tests during the next phases of the pandemic when vaccination campaigns are consolidated in most countries worldwide.
Proficiency testing in EQA schemes allows to compare the accuracy of different tests and the performance of different laboratories based on the same material. Although the number of study participants (n=55) and moreover the total number of performed tests (n=162) was sufficient to gain valuable insights into the quality of serological SARS-CoV-2 assays, the abundance, availability and variety of different SARS-CoV-2 assays used by the participants, limits the number of results obtained per specific assay by different laboratories and therefore the statistical power and confidence in the results. It would be desirable to perform additional

follow-up studies. The wide variety in tests used and general lack of routine incorporation of international standards in SARS-CoV-2 serology prevents comparisons of immune responses across laboratories, thereby hampering standardised cross-border sero-epidemiological surveillance and the wide implementation of immunoassays to identify correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2, e.g. in the context of vaccination policies or the EU Digital COVID Certificate Regulation [25].
Nevertheless, proficiency testing is important for individual laboratories. The results of an EQA allow laboratories to identify potential problems and improve the reliability of their diagnosis. Interestingly, one laboratory repeated their tests upon receipt of their EQA results which included three false negative results using two different assays. In this second attempt, the results were correct. This laboratory indicated insufficient homogenisation of the samples as a potential explanation for the observed discrepancies.
Conclusion
A general capability for reliable, harmonised and standardised characterisation of the main immunological markers of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to increase the overall utility of serology testing. Potential inconsistent test performance and the absence of a rationale to use quantitative antibody assays due to the, yet, undetermined correlates of protection of antibody levels, currently limits the overall usefulness of serology. Participation in EQAs may help to improve implementation of diagnostic tests. Our EQA showed a high capability across European reference laboratories for reliable diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. Serological tests that provide robust and reliable detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are available. However, the use of standards is necessary for meaningful quantitative measurements to increase the overall use of serology testing, including the evaluation of antibody waning and possible reactivity against more relevant virus variants with immunological escape potential in the prospective of a more `personalised' approach to vaccination strategies. This is particularly relevant given that serology is no longer restricted to reference laboratories. Numerous laboratories non specialised in microbiology are performing serological tests using a wide panel of commercial assays. In order to maintain serological test quality, it would also be advisable to implement EQAs at national level, including schemes to evaluate and distinguish natural immunity and vaccination response.

COVID-19, the severe acute respiratory syndrome, is one of the major emergencies that have affected health care systems. Drugs and oxygen are only partially effective in saving lives in patients with severe COVID-19, and the most important protection from death is vaccination. The widespread use of COVID-19 adenovirus-based vaccines has provided evidence for the occurrence of rare venous thrombotic events including cerebral venous thrombosis and splanchnic venous thrombosis in recipients of Vaxzevria and Jcovden vaccines and the review focus on them. One year ago, thromboses in Vaxzevria recipients have been associated with thrombocytopenia in the presence of antibodies to platelet factor 4 and have been called vaccineinduced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). The incidence of VITT is equal to 9-31 events per one million doses of vaccines as evaluated by health agencies worldwide and is higher in female and young vaccine recipients. More recently, by using the European EudraVigilance database, it has been demonstrated that the incidence of thrombosis in recipients of adenovirus-based vaccines is 5-10 fold higher than that of VITT and 7-12 fold higher than observed in the recipients of Comirnaty, an mRNAbased vaccine, suggesting that adenovirus-based vaccines cause not only VITT but also thrombosis without thrombocytopenia (non-VITT thrombosis). The incidence of the vaccine-dependent non-VITT thrombosis is different in the adenovirus-based vaccines and the VITT/non-VITT incidence ratio depends on the severity of thrombosis and is inversely related to the age of the recipients. The possible causes and clinical implications of non-VITT thrombosis in vaccine recipients are discussed.

Efficacy and adverse events of COVID-19 vaccines
COVID-19 vaccines protect against severe COVID-19
COVID-19, the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is one of the major emergencies that have affected health care systems and society in recent decades. The clinical signs of COVID-19 depend on the severity of the disease and can be classified as mild, severe, and critical (1). Severe COVID-19 is characterized by oxygen saturation <90% on room air, signs of pneumonia, and trouble breathing. Exacerbation of the disease is defined by hypoxemic respiratory failure, sepsis, septic shock, and impairment of multiple organs, particularly the lungs (pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome), heart (arrhythmias, chest pain), brain (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness), kidneys, and liver. Many symptoms derive from the inflammatory response to the SARSCoV-2 virus and the activation of coagulation. The Spike (S) protein may be implicated in the development of both phenomena (2-5).
In patients with a critical disease, drugs and life-sustaining treatments are only partially effective in saving lives (1, 6, 7), and the most important protection from death is represented by vaccination (8-14).
The mRNA-based vaccines Comirnaty (BNT162b2) and Spikevax (mRNA1273) and the adenovirus-based vaccines Vaxzevria (ChadOx1 nCoV-19) and Jcovden (AD26.COV2.S) were the first approved vaccines. Several studies have shown that these vaccines provide important protection against infection, severe COVID-19, and death (11-15). With the advent of omicron, protection against symptomatic disease is relatively poor, ranging from 20 to 80% after the primary vaccine series, but rapidly decreasing over time (0-30% of effectiveness 4- 5 months after the last dose) (16-18). Despite the presence of major differences in efficacy following vaccination, as shown by several studies evaluating the same vaccine, it seems reasonable to conclude that protection is slightly lower after vaccination with adenovirus-based vaccines (18). On the contrary, the effectiveness of the vaccines against severe disease and hospitalization is high, ranging from 80 to 100% after the booster dose and remaining constant over time (18).
Adverse events of COVID-19 vaccines
The adverse events (AEs) observed following vaccination are largely mild or moderate in severity and include fever, chills, headache, flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, and lymphadenopathy (19-22). These events are observed soon after the injection, are not life-threatening and, except for extremely rare anaphylactic reactions, do not require additional

treatments. On the other hand, severe AEs (SAEs), although rare, may occur even several days after vaccination and can be life-threatening.
Some SAEs were described for all vaccines, such as myocarditis and pericarditis; in a recently published study (23), the number of these events in young vaccinated males was 11.5, 11.7, and 15.4 events per million doses administered (OMD) of Comirnaty, Spikevax, and Vaxzevria, respectively. These events were reversible and no deaths were observed in under-40 vaccine recipients (23).
Some SAEs occur more frequently with only one/some vaccines, such as Bell's palsy, caused by Comirnaty and Spikevax (24), and Guillain-Barré syndrome, caused by Jcovden (25). Other SAEs associated with specific COVID-19 vaccines are the venous and arterial thromboses observed in recipients of adenovirus-based vaccines. Our review focuses on these SAEs and their association with thrombocytopenia.
Venous thrombosis in recipients of adenovirus-based vaccines
Vaxzevria causes vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia
The widespread use of COVID-19 vaccines has provided evidence for the occurrence of rare venous thrombotic events in recipients of the Vaxzevria vaccine (26). After two studies demonstrated that, in Vaxzevria recipients, venous thrombotic events [cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), splanchnic venous thrombosis, and/or other thromboses] are observed in association with platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia and antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) (27, 28), such event was called vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). VITT is similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and is considered an adverse event caused by Vaxzevria (26). Vaccine-induced anti-PF4 antibodies are thought to be responsible for these thrombotic complications because anti-PF4 antibodies were rarely found in CVT patients in the past (i.e., before VITT) (29, 30).
The role of anti-PF4 antibodies in adenovirus-based vaccines was recently confirmed (31, 32). Baker et al. performed a computational simulation showing the electrostatic interaction of adenoviruses with PF4, which was experimentally confirmed by surface plasmon resonance. Greinacher et al. showed that vaccine components can form antigenic complexes with PF4 on platelet surfaces, which become targets of antiPF4 antibodies in patients with VITT. In addition, they demonstrated that approximately 50% of the protein content of the Vaxzevria vaccine belongs to T-REx-293, the cells in which it is produced, and that EDTA, an excipient of the

Vaxzevria vaccine, causes local vascular leakage that favors the systemic dissemination of the vaccine components (32). Finally, a confirmation of the pathogenesis of VITT comes from a washed platelet aggregation-based assay (32).
Incidence of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia in Vaxzevria recipients
After the discovery that Vaxzevria causes VITT, the incidence of VITT was classified as very rare by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (26) but with the accumulation of data, regulatory agencies stated that in Vaxzevria recipients, 13 SAEs per 100,000 vaccinations are VITT. In particular, EMA, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA, UK), Health Canada, and the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) reported 9.3, 15.1, 21.9, and 27-31 VITT/OMD, respectively (33-36).
By evaluating SAEs from each patient report and considering only patients in whom both thrombosis and thrombocytopenia were reported, we showed that the VITT incidence in the European EudraVigilance database (EEd) was 19.4 SAEs/OMD in Vaxzevria recipients (37). The frequency of VITT reports is about 40 folds greater than that shown in Comirnaty recipients. Similar results were found in South Korea (38) even if the incidence of VITT in Vaxzevria recipients was lower than that observed in EEd.
Study findings and the variable incidence of VITT observed worldwide by regulatory agencies may be due to several factors, including genetics and co-morbidity of vaccinated populations, besides the fact that the sex and age of Vaxzevria recipients may also play a role. For example, we found that the incidence of CVT in Vaxzevria recipients was much higher in young people and women of childbearing age than in adult males and the elderly (39). In particular, a sixfold difference in CVT incidence was found between 18 and 24 years and 60-69 years Vaxzevria recipients (39). Thus, the difference in the incidence of VITT after the Vaxzevria vaccine in South Korea compared with Europe may be due, at least in part, to the age of vaccinee. In fact, in South Korea only 18.3% of the vaccinated people were under 50 years of age, whereas in Europe, these were 37.1% of the population (38, 39).
The incidence of thrombosis after Vaxzevria is much higher than that of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia
In Vaxzevria recipients, the incidence of thrombosis including CVTs, splanchnic vein thromboses, thromboembolic diseases, and "other" venous thrombotic events (with or without

thrombocytopenia) was about 5 fold more (110.6 SAEs/OMD) than the above-reported incidence of VITT (37). Moreover, in the same recipients, the incidence of thromboses and thrombosis-related deaths was much higher than that observed in Comirnaty recipients, used as a baseline reference (37). Two more studies demonstrated an increased risk of venous thrombosis in Vaxzevria than in Comirnaty and Spikevax recipients (40, 41).
Given clinicians' knowledge of VITT and the recommendation of regulatory authorities to check platelet count in the presence of thrombosis (42), underreporting of low platelet count is unlikely, and data suggest that most thromboses observed in Vaxzevria recipients, despite being caused by vaccination, occur without thrombocytopenia (nonVITT thrombosis). Non-VITT thrombosis following Vaxzevria vaccination has been reported by case studies and shows a persistently normal platelet count and can occur both in the presence and in the absence of anti-PF4 antibodies (43-46).
In Vaxzevria recipients, the VITT/non-VITT thrombosis incidence ratio is severity-dependent and inversely correlated with age
In Vaxzevria recipients, relevant differences in the association between thrombosis and thrombocytopenia are observed depending on the severity of thrombosis. Indeed, thrombocytopenia is associated with 18% of thrombotic SAEs and 48% of thrombosis-related deaths (37). Therefore, the non-VITT/VITT thrombosis incidence ratio is equal to 4.6 in thrombotic SAEs and 1.1 in thrombosis-related deaths. Moreover, thrombocytopenia is associated with 49% of CVT, one of the most severe thrombosis, and 77% of CVT-related deaths (37).
In addition, the incidence of the thrombocytopenia/CVT association is even higher in young-adults representing 83% of Vaxzevria recipients who died because of CVT (37) (Figure 1A). Data are consistent with the results published by Greinacher et al. that considered deadly Vaxzevria-dependent CVT to be almost always associated with thrombocytopenia (27). Therefore, thrombocytopenia is more frequent in lifethreatening thromboses than in non-fatal ones and in youngadults than in the elderly.
Incidence of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia in Jcovden recipients
Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) has also been observed in Jcovden recipients (47, 48), making VITT one of the severe AEs of Jcovden (49). Notably, the incidence of VITT in

Jcovden recipients is lower than that observed in Vaxzevria recipients (37). The lower incidence of VITT in Jcovden as compared to Vaxzevria recipients is observed both in young-adults (12.9 vs. 24.1 SAEs/OMD) and in the elderly (6.5 vs. 12.7 SAEs/OMD) (37). Even VITT-related deaths are less frequent in Jcovden as compared to Vaxzevria recipients (37).
The incidence of thrombosis after Jcovden is much higher than that of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia
As in the case of Vaxzevria, the incidence of Jcovdendependent thrombosis is much higher (131 SAEs/OMD) than the incidence of VITT (11.2 SAEs/OMD) (37), suggesting that most vaccine-dependent thromboses are unrelated to thrombocytopenia. The incidence of VITT decreases with the age of the vaccinee (37). Indeed, thrombocytopenia is associated with 11% and 4% of thrombotic SAEs in young-adults and elderly, respectively (Figure 1B) (39) and, in those who die, thrombocytopenia is associated with about 41 and 26% of the thrombotic SAEs in young-adults and elderly, respectively (Figure 1B) (39). Moreover, the incidence of VITT increases with the severity of SAEs (Figure 1B) (37). An exception to the trend of VITT incidence is the virtual absence of VITT in the elderly with CVT or dying of CVT (Figure 1B) (37). One case report described the occurrence of non-VITT thrombosis in Jcovden recipients (50).
Differences between Vaxzevria- and Jcovden-dependent thrombosis
The VITT/non-VITT incidence ratio in Vaxzevria and Jcovden recipients is different, although both are adenovirusbased vaccines. While Vaxzevria recipients show a twice higher incidence of VITT than Jcovden recipients, the incidence of non-VITT thrombosis is higher in Jcovden recipients than in Vaxzevria recipients (120 and 91 SAEs/OMD, respectively) (37). In addition, the incidence of thrombosis and thromboembolic diseases is similar in Vaxzevria and Jcovden young-adult recipients and is higher in Jcovden than Vaxzevria elderly recipients (37).
Arterial thrombosis in recipients of adenovirus-based vaccines
The incidence of arterial thrombotic events [myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and non-cardiac, non-cerebral

arterial thrombotic events (37)] in Vaxzevria and Jcovden recipients has been compared with that in Comirnaty, used as baseline control (37). The incidence of myocardial infarction reported in EEd in young-adult recipients of adenovirus-based vaccines is about sixfold higher, compared with Comirnaty, and an even higher incidence was observed in other arterial SAEs (Figure 2A), suggesting that Vaxzevria and Jcovden vaccines not only cause venous thrombosis events but also cause arterial thrombosis. Specifically, in Jcovden elderly recipients, the excess of ischemic stroke over Comirnaty is 106 SAEs/OMD, causing an excess of 10.5 deaths/OMD (37). A recent study, confirms that Vaxzevria and Jcovden vaccines are associated with myocardial infarction (relative incidence, 1.29 and 1.75, respectively), even if significance concerning the SAE due to Jcovden was not reached, probably due to the low number of vaccinations with Jcovden (50).
Regarding arterial SAEs, Jcovden causes more SAEs and SAE-dependent deaths than Vaxzevria (Figure 2B).
Discussion
Are VITT and non-VITT thromboses caused by different mechanisms?
It can be hypothesized that non-VITT thrombosis can occur in two ways. First, thrombosis is caused by antiPF4 antibodies that activate platelets only at specific sites and do not cause thrombocytopenia [thrombosis with anti-PF4 antibodies without thrombocytopenia syndrome (T4-noTS)]. T4-noTS would mean that platelets, activated by low concentrations of anti-PF4 antibodies, aggregate mainly at sites where predisposing factors (e.g., proinflammatory environment, blood stasis) are present without causing massive consumption of platelets and thrombocytopenia. According to this hypothesis, T4noTS would be caused by the same mechanisms leading to VITT. The hypothesis seems to be confirmed by the higher incidence of thrombocytopenia in vaccine recipients who die due to thrombosis as compared to those who survive.
The second way to envision non-VITT thrombosis is to hypothesize that anti-PF4 antibodies are not involved when thrombosis is not associated with thrombocytopenia [thrombosis without anti-PF4 antibodies without thrombocytopenia syndrome (T-no4TS)]. T-no4TS could be caused by factors promoting platelet aggregation, such as an inflammatory response favored by adenovirus-based vaccines and local predisposing factors. The hypothesis seems to be confirmed by the higher incidence of arterial thrombotic events in adenovirus-based vaccine recipients, the different incidence of thrombosis and VITT between Vaxzevria and Jcovden

recipients, and the different ages at which VITT and non-VITT thrombosis are observed.
How can vaccines cause pro-thrombotic effects independent of anti-PF4 antibodies?
Azzarone et al. hypothesized that in vaccine recipients suffering from local inflammatory reaction, an early event is represented by the production of interleukin 6 (IL-6) (3) which favors endothelial cells reactivity and induces plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (51, 52), the main physiological inhibitor of the plasminogen activators in the bloodstream (53). A confirmation of the hypothesis came from an

observational study demonstrating that 24-48h following Vaxzevria vaccination, the IL-6 levels were almost doubled (54).
Interestingly, another observational study demonstrated that in healthy young-adults vaccinated with Vaxzevria, hemostatic changes were still present after about one month from vaccination (55). In particular, the levels of Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and active VWF, indicating endothelial activation, were increased 39% and 24%, respectively. Moreover, faster thrombin generation (i.e., more active coagulation system) and lower coagulations levels (use of coagulation factors) were observed, suggesting that the hemostatic system of vaccinee is shifted to a more procoagulant state compared to unvaccinated controls. Therefore, non-VITT thromboembolic events may be the clinical expression of procoagulant coagulation profile, consequent to a pro-inflammatory

trigger, represented by vaccination with adenovirus-based vaccines.
How do vaccine components determine pro-inflammatory/pro-thrombotic events?
In search of potential pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic triggering factors present in virus-based vaccines, we found three factors: the S protein (2, 4, 56, 57), the adenovirus particles (3, 31), and the cellular debris present in vaccine preparation (32).
The presence of S protein in blood vessels and tissues other than the muscle into which the vaccine is injected can be hypothesized. The S protein may induce proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in macrophages (56, 57) and T cells (58), directly damage endothelium (4), activate platelets (5), and autoimmune response, the latter triggered by antigenic epitopes of S protein shared with molecular chaperones (59). However, given the lower incidence of thrombosis and arterial SAEs in Comirnaty recipients, S protein appears to be not sufficient to cause such events, at least at the concentration determined by the Comirnaty vaccine.
Viral blood dissemination was detected either in patients treated with infusions of adenoviral vectors in the tumor or the right hepatic artery (51, 60). Indeed, after the injection of Vaxzevria into mice, sporadic small amounts of the virus were found in other tissues (61). Adenoviral particles seem to not promote platelet aggregation (3), but the receptors mediating the binding of adenoviral particles to cells are expressed by human endothelial cells, platelets, and erythrocytes (3, 31).
Finally, it should also be considered that the Vaxzevria and Jcovden vaccines contain residual cellular proteins from the cell lines by which adenoviruses are produced likely causing platelet activation (32).
If the reasons why adenovirus-based vaccines cause nonVITT thrombosis and arterial events might be those mentioned above, it is currently impossible to say which is the main culprit. Their synergism is likely crucial.
Why is the incidence of severe adverse events different in recipients of Vaxzevria and Jcovden?
The different incidences of VITT, non-VITT thromboses, and arterial events in recipients of Vaxzevria and Jcovden may be explained by the differences between the two vaccines, which can be summarized as follows. First, the type of adenovirus is different and it has been demonstrated that chimpanzee

adenovirus (Vaxzevria) has a stronger negative charge than the human Ad26 virus (Jcovden) (62). Moreover, molecular simulations suggest that the Vaxzevria's adenovirus charge and shape could allow it to bind to the positively charged PF4 protein (31). Second, the amount of infectious units in the Jcovden vaccine is 3.3-fold higher than that in the Vaxzevria vaccine (49, 63), possibly implying a higher S protein and adenoviral protein burden. Third, the human cell lines by which adenoviruses are produced are different: T-REx-293 cells for Vaxzevria and PER.C6 TetR cells for Jcovden (64). Furthermore, approximately 50% of the protein content of the Vaxzevria vaccine belongs to T-REx-293 (32), while Jcovden seems to be less contaminated by cell line debris (64). Finally, EDTA is present in the Vaxzevria vaccine but not in the Jcovden vaccine (49, 63) and may favor the development of inflammation at the vaccine inoculation site.
Concluding remarks
The incidence of VITT, non-VITT thrombosis, and arterial events, although rare, is much higher in recipients of Vaxzevria and Jcovden vaccines than in recipients of the Comirnaty vaccine (37, 38), suggesting a causal relationship between these events and the adenovirus-based vaccines. We hypothesize that the venous and arterial thromboses observed with adenovirus-based vaccines and observed in absence of thrombocytopenia are due to the combination of at least three triggering factors, all of which may be involved in vascular inflammation and coagulation, and several arguments suggest that it is independent of anti-PF4 antibodies (T-no4TS). However, further studies are needed to confidently exclude that non-VITT thromboses are due to low levels of antiPF4 antibodies.
In Vaxzevria recipients with thrombosis, the incidence of VITT is very high when they die due to CVT. However, in the presence of thrombosis other than CVT, the incidence of VITT is lower, and it is further reduced in the elderly and young adults who do not die. Therefore, in recently vaccinated individuals, the possibility that a thrombosis or arterial event is caused by adenovirus-based vaccines should be considered even in the absence of thrombocytopenia, favoring a correct diagnosis and providing important information for the management of treatment.

Introduction: COVID-19 is associated with an increased mortality in hemodialysis patients. Therefore, achieving a long-lasting effective immune response to SARSCoV-2 vaccines is essential. This study describes the humoral immune response in hemodialysis patients following three doses of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, and explores the factors associated with a sustained immune response.
Materials and Methods: We analyzed the monthly serological evolution of SARS-CoV2 anti-S(RBD) antibodies for 1 year in 178 chronic hemodialysis patients who received three doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. The primary outcome was sustained effective humoral response defined as anti-S(RBD) levels > 1,000 AU/ml after 4 months from the third dose. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify features associated with a sustained humoral immune response.
Results: After the initial two SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine doses, 77.8% of patients showed an immediate effective humoral response, decreasing to 52.5% after 4 months. Antibody levels were significantly higher in COVID-exposed patients and HBV vaccine responders. After the third dose, 97% of patients showed an effective humoral response, and remained in 91.7% after 4 months. The mean monthly rate of antibody titer decline decreased from 33 ± 14.5 to 25 ± 16.7%. Multivariate regression analysis showed that previous exposure to COVID-19 and response to HBV vaccines were associated with an effective sustained humoral immune response.
Conclusion: Immunization with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines elicits an effective immediate humoral immune response in hemodialysis patients, with a progressive waning in antibody levels. A third booster dose enhances the immune response with significantly higher antibody levels and more sustained humoral immune response. COVID-naïve patients and patients without previous response to HBV vaccines are likely to benefit from receiving more booster doses to maintain an effective immune response.

Response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccines in Hemodialysis

INTRODUCTION
Patients on hemodialysis (HD) have an increased incidence of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to the general population, and when infected their mortality risk is higher (1-3). For these reasons, HD patients have been included as one of the priority groups in vaccination programs (4, 5). This practice has been carried out despite the fact that chronic kidney disease patients have been excluded from the main studies on vaccination (6-8) and that their immune response to vaccination against other viruses is less effective than in the general population (9).
There are no specific recommendations concerning the most adequate vaccine regimen for HD patients. Around 90% of HD patients without previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 develop an immediate humoral and cellular immune response after the administration of two doses of mRNA vaccines (10, 11). Despite these results, there is a reported mortality of 11% in HD patients who get infected with COVID-19 after receiving the two mRNA vaccine doses (12). This elevated mortality can be attributed to different factors: a lower and less effective immunological response compared to the general population (13, 14) as well as a progressive decrease in antibody levels (15). For these reasons, the administration of a third SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine dose has been recommended (12, 16, 17).
There are no longitudinal studies concerning SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immune responses for more than 4 weeks after receiving the third mRNA vaccine dose in patients on HD, which are needed to optimize clinical care and plan preventive strategies in this population.
In this study, we describe the serological monthly changes against SARS-CoV-2 in HD patients after 1 year of follow-up from an initial immunization with two doses of mRNA vaccines. A third booster dose was administered after 5 months from the second dose, with continuous monthly serological assessment for 4 months following the third vaccine dose. We aimed to describe the factors associated with a sustained humoral response and identify the group of patients who are more likely to benefit from receiving a third booster dose.

positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab or in presence of nucleocapsidIgG specific antibodies in serological analyses before the administration of the first dose of the vaccine. Patients who had received the vaccination schedule before starting HD, patients with an unknown serological status for SARS-CoV-2 before vaccination and patients who either received an adenoviral vector-based vaccine or did not complete the full SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine schedule were excluded from the study.
The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and received the approval of the Ethical Committee for Clinical Investigation of the Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón. All patients signed an informed consent form and approved the use of their anonymized clinical information for medical research purposes.
Vaccination Schedule Data and Sample Collection
Patients received two initial doses of either mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) separated by 4 weeks, followed by a third booster dose after 5 months. Serum samples for SARS-CoV-2 antispike 1 receptor binding domain [anti-S(RBD)] IgG antibody titers were obtained 2 months prior to the administration of the first dose of the vaccine as well as immediately before vaccination, immediately after the administration of the first and the second dose of vaccine, and thence in a monthly basis up to 4 months after the third booster dose, which would correspond to 10 months after the administration of the first dose (Figure 1). This serological follow-up strategy was performed following the protocol implemented by the Preventive Medicine Department at our center, to be able to assess humoral immunity changes, and detect asymptomatic infected patients.
We examined associations between anti-S(RBD) IgG antibodies and potential predictors such as demographic and clinical data, type of dialysis and type of the vaccine, previous exposure to COVID-19, history of effective humoral response to hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines, and treatment with immunosuppressants. Medical histories of study participants were extracted from their medical records.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Population
We designed an observational, longitudinal study to evaluate the immune response induced by the different mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in patients attending two HD units: an incenter hospital dialysis unit and its affiliated satellite dialysis unit. The study comprised all HD patients who received vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 with a two-dose mRNA vaccine between December 28th 2020 and June 30th 2021, either BNT162b2 (BionTech/Pfizer) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna), given according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The type of vaccine was assigned according to the available vaccines at the local vaccination point or at our center.
Patients were classified as having had a prior COVID-19 infection if there was clear medical documentation with a

Serological Analysis
Antibody response was determined using the chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV2 in human serum (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, Illinois) which provides quantitative measures of IgG antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD. Results are given as arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/ml), and were interpreted as positive according to the manufacturer's instructions, with a cutoff index value of > 50 AU/ml. The upper limit of quantification was 40,000 AU/ml. The humoral response was considered as effective when the value of SARS-CoV-2 anti-S(RBD) antibodies was > 1,000 AU/ml, which strongly correlates with a sustained neutralizing antibody response of 1/80 measured by plaque reduction neutralization titer (18, 19). The arbitrary units (AU) may be converted to BAU (for the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assays the conversion is 1

Definitions
Dialysis vintage was defined as the time between the first HD session and the administration of the first dose of mRNA vaccine. Response to HBV vaccine was defined as an anti-HBs antibody titer > 10 IU/ml after four doses of Engerix-B or Fendrix. Immediate humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was defined as an anti-S(RBD) antibody titer > 50 AU/ml 4 weeks after the second dose of the vaccine, and the same cutoff was used in every monthly serological assay. Effective humoral response was defined as an anti-S(RBD) antibody titer > 1,000 AU/ml, and sustained humoral response was defined as a persistent antibody titer > 1,000 AU/ml for more than 4 months.

Statistical Analysis
Demographic and clinical information are described for all patients included in the study. Data were presented as a number (percentage) for categorical variables, as mean ± standard deviation for continuous variables that were normally distributed, and as median (interquartile range; IQR) for continuous variables that were non-parametric. Continuous variables were first tested for normal distribution using ShapiroWilk, and then compared by t-test, if normally distributed, or by the Mann-Whitney test if abnormally distributed. A Chi-square test was used for categorical variables. Multivariable logistic stepwise regression was used to determine the independent factors associated with an effective humoral response [antiS(RBD) IgG > 1,000 AU/ml] 4 months after the first two mRNA doses and 4 months after the third dose. The covariates

inclusion criteria and were therefore excluded. Ultimately, 178 patients were eligible and were included in the study. Figure 2 shows the flowchart of the study population. 138 patients (77.5%) received mRNA-1273 vaccines and 40 patients (22.5%) received BNT162b2 vaccines. 23 patients (12.9%) were considered immunosuppressed; eight patients (34.8%) received anti-cancer treatment and/or targeted therapies, 10 patients (43.5%) were under prolonged steroid treatment, two patients (8.7%) were under treatment with interleukin inhibitors, and three patients (13%) were under treatment with calcineurin inhibitors, one of them with additional mycophenolic acid and steroids. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the whole study population, as well as laboratory and serological data before vaccination are described in Table 1.
Humoral Response After Vaccination in the Whole Study Population
The evolution of IgG anti-S(RBD) antibody levels in the whole cohort throughout the study period is represented in Figure 3. After receiving the second dose of mRNA vaccine, 96.6% of patients had positive anti-S(RBD) antibodies, with a gradual decrease in the proportion of patients with positive antibodies to 91.4% after 4 months from the second dose. Median anti-S(RBD) antibody levels decreased from a peak of 4,366 AU/ml (1,271- 17,125) 1 month after the second vaccine dose, to 1,144 AU/ml (232-3,598) after 4 months (p < 0.001). After receiving the third mRNA vaccine dose, the proportion of patients who seroconverted increased to 98.3%, and this rate remained stable for the following 4 months. Median antibody levels rose up to 26,037 AU/ml (11,976-40,000) and decreased to 9,180 AU/ml (3,489-30,499) after 4 months from the booster dose (p < 0.001).
The proportion of patients with IgG anti-S(RBD) antibody levels over 1,000 AU/ml changed in a similar manner, from 77.8% of patients after receiving the first two doses, to 52.5% of patients 4 months after the second dose, rising up to 97% after receiving the third booster dose, and remaining in 91.7% of patients after 4 months from the third dose (Figure 3B). Overall, patients receiving mRNA-1273 had higher peak anti-S(RBD) antibody levels compared with BNT162b2 [median 6,468 AU/ml (IQR 1927-19623) vs. 1,630 AU/ml (IQR 482-3554), p < 0.001].
Changes in Humoral Response According to Previous Exposure to SARS-CoV-2
We stratified the study population according to previous SARSCoV-2 exposure into patients with prior COVID-19 infection before vaccination (n = 33) and those who were COVID-19 naïve at the time of vaccination (n = 145) (Table 2). There was a higher proportion of males (78.8% vs. 60%, p = 0.04), and lower proportion of patients with online haemodiafiltration (45.5% vs. 66.2%, p = 0.03) in the group of patients with prior COVID-19 infection. Pre-vaccination levels of anti-S(RBD) IgG antibodies were elevated in 78.8% of COVID-exposed patients, with a median antibody titer of 1,123 AU/ml, of which 51.5% had antibody levels higher than 1,000 AU/ml before vaccination. On the other hand, in the COVID-naïve group only two patients

FIGURE 3 | Monthly SARS-CoV-2 serological follow-up: (A) median monthly anti-S(RBD) antibody levels, (B) proportion of patients with positive and effective humoral responses at each time point during follow-up.

(1.4%) had positive anti-S(RBD) antibody levels that were slightly elevated (56 and 63 AU/ml) with negative IgG nucleocapsid antibodies and no history of COVID-19 infection, and were thus considered COVID-naïve.
The proportion of patients who achieved seroconversion was similar in both groups (Supplementary Figure 1). However, the evolution of antibody levels was significantly different in both groups; peak IgG anti-S(RBD) antibody levels after the first two vaccine doses were higher in patients with a prior exposure to COVID-19 (median 40,000 AU/ml, IQR 23,553-40,000) compared with those who were COVID-naïve (median 3,061 AU/ml, IQR 950-8,999) (p < 0.001), and remained so at every monthly assay. Serological changes in patients with previous COVID-19 exposure and in COVIDnaïve patients is represented in Figure 4A. Although there were significant differences in the proportion of patients with an effective seroconversion of anti-S(RBD) levels > 1,000 AU/ml between COVID-naïve and COVID-exposed patients following the initial two-dose mRNA vaccination, the administration of a third mRNA vaccine dose matched the proportion of effective humoral response between both groups (Figure 4B). However, median antibody levels remained significantly higher in patients previously exposed to COVID-19 compared to COVID-naïve patients throughout the study period, even after receiving the third vaccine dose (at end of follow-up: 29,740 AU/ml [11,637- 40,000] vs. 6,970 AU/ml [2,907-22,903], p < 0.001).
Changes in Humoral Response According to Previous Response to Hepatitis B Virus Vaccines
In our cohort, 122 patients (68.5%) had received a full HBV vaccination regimen, of which 84 patients (68.9%) had an effective humoral response. Table 2 shows the baseline differences between HBV vaccine responders and non-responders, and differences in median antibody levels throughout follow-up. HBV vaccine responders showed a significantly higher initial

humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines compared to those patients who previously did not respond to HBV vaccines (Figure 5A). Peak IgG anti-S(RBD) antibody levels were higher in patients with a history of effective humoral response to HBV vaccines (median 5,003 AU/ml, IQR 2,276- 16,576) compared with HBV vaccine non-responders (median 2,056 AU/ml, IQR 444-8,223) (p = 0.002), and these differences remained for the following 4 months after the initial twodose vaccine. Nonetheless, after the third SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose, the proportion of patients who had positive anti-S(RBD) antibody levels was matched in both groups (Supplementary Figure 2), but the rate of effective humoral response after the third booster dose remained significantly higher in HBV vaccine responders from the second month onward (Figure 5B).
Decrease in Anti-S(RBD) Antibody Levels Before and After the Third mRNA Vaccine Dose
After a median follow-up of 4 months after the second dose of mRNA vaccine, there was a mean monthly decrease in antiS(RBD) antibodies of 33 ± 14.5%. This decrease was significantly steeper in patients who were COVID-naïve (36.5 ± 11% per month) compared to patients with previous exposure to COVID19 (17.5 ± 6%) (p < 0.001) (Figure 6A).
The mean monthly rate of antibody titer decline decreased to 25 ± 16.7% after the third dose (p < 0.001). Although the rate of antibody level decline remained significantly lower in patients with previous exposure to COVID-19 (12.4 ± 8% vs. 27.8 ± 16%, p < 0.001), COVID-naïve patients also showed a more sustained humoral response after the third dose compared to the initial vaccination, with a monthly decrease in the rate of antibody level decline from 36.5 ± 11 to 27.8 ± 16% (p < 0.001). Also, patients who were responders to HBV vaccines showed a more sustained response after the third dose, with a decrease in the rate of antibody decline from 33.5 ± 12.3 per month to 24.7 ± 16% per month (p < 0.001) (Figure 6B).

Determinants of Sustained Seroconversion After the Initial Vaccination
We analyzed factors that were associated with an effective humoral response after the initial two-dose mRNA vaccination. Patients with previous exposure to COVID-19 (OR 16.5, CI 95% 3.8-72.5), previous humoral response to HBV vaccines (OR 3.5, CI 95% 1.5-8.1), patients who were < 70 years old (OR 3.5, CI 95% 1.8-6.7) and patients who received mRNA-1273 (OR 3.2, CI 95% 1.4-7.3) were associated with an effective sustained humoral response after 4 months from vaccination in the univariate analysis. Patients with history of neoplasms were less likely to maintain an effective humoral response (OR 0.4, CI 95% 0.2- 1.1). In the multivariable linear regression model, both previous exposure to COVID-19 infection and previous humoral response

to HBV vaccines maintained statistical significance. Details are presented in Table 3.
Determinants of Sustained Seroconversion After the Booster Dose
In the univariate analysis to determine the factors associated with a sustained humoral response after 4 months from receiving the third dose of mRNA vaccine, we found an association with response to HBV vaccines (OR 13.8, CI 95% 1.5-123.9), and a tendency for a less likely effective seroconversion in patients receiving immunosuppressants (OR 0.29, CI 95% 0.08-1.08). After adjusting for age, dialysis vintage, immunosuppression, and type of vaccine administered, the humoral response to HBV vaccines remained as an independent factor associated with an effective sustained humoral response after 1 year from the

initial vaccination. All patients with prior exposure to COVID19 developed an effective humoral response, and therefore could not be included as a factor in the multivariate analysis (Table 4).
Breakthrough COVID-19 Infections
Throughout the year following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, there were 23 vaccinated patients (12.9%) who were diagnosed with

SARS-CoV-2 infection, of which 3 cases (1.7%) were after receiving the first two doses, and the remaining cases (11.2%) were diagnosed after receiving the third dose of vaccination. Twenty-one patients (91.3% of the infected patients) remained asymptomatic. There were only two cases (1.1%) of severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure requiring hospital admission and high flow oxygen therapy among vaccinated

patients included in this study, both of which had an inadequate humoral response to the vaccine. The first patient was an 85year-old male patient who became infected 3 months after receiving the first two mRNA vaccine doses, having reached a peak SARS-CoV-2 anti-S(RBD) antibody titer of 1,007 AU/ml in the first month after vaccination, and decreasing to 510 AU/ml in the second month, just before infection. The second patient was a 72-year-old female patient under immunosuppression with tocilizumab due to severe rheumatoid arthritis. She never responded to the initial two doses of mRNA vaccine nor to the booster dose (peak SARS-CoV-2 anti-S-RBD antibodies 1 AU/ml) and was infected 3 months after receiving the third dose. Neither patient had a history of COVID-19 infection before vaccination, and both patients died.
DISCUSSION
In this serological study we examined the monthly changes in SARS-CoV-2 anti-S(RBD) IgG levels for 1 year after vaccination. We observed that patients who were COVID-naïve and those who had not previously responded to HBV vaccines benefited the most from a third mRNA vaccine dose against SARS-CoV2, since it provided them with an effective humoral response (anti-S-RBD IgG levels > 1,000 AU/ml), both immediately after vaccination and also sustained in time for at least 4 months after receiving the booster dose, whereas the first two doses had been unable to elicit such a sustained response.
Several studies have determined the factors that are associated with an immediate humoral response few weeks after vaccination, including serum albumin levels, lymphocytes, dialysis vintage, intravenous iron dose, immunosuppressant treatment, previous infection with COVID-19, and a positive response to HBV vaccines (20-22). In our study, we demonstrate in a multivariable model that the factors associated with a sustained humoral response 4 months after the third booster dose were having had a previous infection with COVID-19 and an effective response to HBV vaccines.
Naïve patients for COVID-19 infection are the ones who benefit the most from vaccination and especially from the administration of a third dose (11). In our study, the serological changes in COVID-naïve patients following vaccination is similar to that previously described: a high proportion of patients (96.8%) develop SARS-CoV-2 anti-S(RBD) antibodies after the first two doses of the vaccine, but not all patients develop an effective response. Only 77.8% of patients achieved a protective response of > 1,000 AU/ml which decreased to 52.5% after 4 months, with a mean decrease of 33% per month in antibody levels. It has been previously described that, thanks to the booster effect, there is an improvement in the humoral response in the first weeks, especially in COVID-naïve patients who did not have an initial response (12, 16, 17, 23). In our study this improvement persists for 4 months after the booster effect. After the third dose, the proportion of patients with antibody levels > 1,000 AU/ml immediately increased to 97%, and the mean monthly drop in antibody levels significantly decreased compared to that following the first two doses, from 36.5 to 27.8%

(p = 0.009). In this way, 4 months after receiving the booster dose, there were no significant differences in the protective humoral response between COVID-naïve patients and those who were previously infected with COVID-19 (89.7% vs. 100%, p = 0.053).
During the study period, the accumulated incidence in our area was around 20,500 cases per 100,000 population (24), predominantly caused by the omicron variant (25). We can assume that these high levels of antibodies provided our patients with an effective protection, as is witnessed by the excellent response in those patients who became infected during follow-up, most of whom were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. In this respect, the beneficial effects of a third dose of mRNA vaccines to achieve this effective serological response against the new variants have been described in the general population (26) and it is probably associated with attaining high levels of antibodies (27).
HD patients who have had a COVID-19 infection have less protection against reinfection than the general population (28). However, 10-14 days after administering the second dose of mRNA vaccine, the serological response was similar to that of healthy vaccinated patients. For this reason, it has been suggested that they would not benefit from the administration of a third dose (12). In our population of HD patients who were previously infected with COVID-19, the initial two-dose mRNA vaccine achieved an increase in effective humoral response from 54.8 to 96.8%, decreasing to just 93.1% after 4 months. Following the third mRNA vaccine dose, all the previously infected patients achieved SARS-CoV-2 anti-S(RBD) antibody levels > 1,000 AU/ml after 4 months from vaccination, and the mean decrease in antibody levels decreased from 17.5% following the second dose to 12.4% after the third dose (p < 0.001). Therefore, this group of patients not only benefits from the first two vaccine doses but also from the booster effect of a third dose, although to a lesser extent than in the COVID-naïve population.
Previous studies have compared the humoral response after the second and third doses. One study analyzed the humoral response after the third dose of the vaccine, showing a slight increase in the proportion of patients who achieve seroconversion, but with a very intense humoral response, reaching a 36-fold increase in median antibody titers after the booster dose (29), and another study showed that a third dose reduced the proportion of patients with no or weak response from 60.8 to 15% (30). An additional study determined that 6 months after the first immunization, 96% of patients who had received three vaccine doses had responded positively, compared to 64% when only two doses had been administered (31). The rate of immediate seroconversion observed in our study after the booster dose confirms the data described by these previous studies. In addition, we verified that the number of seroconverted patients remains constant (99%) after 4 months, most of whom show a protective humoral response (91.7%).
It has been previously described that there is an association between humoral responses after HBV and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in HD (21, 32, 33). In our study, humoral response to HBV vaccines was an independent factor associated with a sustained humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Similar to COVID-naïve patients, those patients who had not previously responded to HBV vaccines have a worse response

to immunization with two doses of mRNA vaccine and clearly benefit from the booster effect. Accordingly, HD patients who are non-responders to HBV vaccines warrant a close serological follow-up against SARS-CoV-2 to monitor immune response and would possibly benefit from a more intense vaccination schedule. Although in previous studies immunosuppressive therapy was shown to be a factor predicting poor response (20), in our study we did not find an association between immunosuppression and long-term humoral response following a third vaccine dose after adjusting for confounding variables.
It should be noted that the most used vaccine in our patients was mRNA-1273, 77.5% of the patients for the first two doses and 91.7% for the third dose (with no significant differences between the different groups of patients). It has been described that the type of vaccine acts as an independent factor for response to vaccination and that mRNA-1273 is the one that obtains the best results, perhaps due to its higher dose of mRNA (21).
We believe that in the future, the rate of antibodies will continue to decline and a significant percentage of patients will probably lose protection in the mid-term. Therefore, monitoring the levels of antibodies in the HD population should be a priority in order to propose new immunizations when necessary, as other authors have suggested (34).
Consequently, we could revaccinate when SARS-CoV-2 antiS(RBS) IgG levels drop below a certain threshold, in a similar way to how revaccination of HBV is recommended when anti-HBs antibodies drop below 10 mIU/mL. We suggest that monitoring of anti-S(RBD) IgG levels should be particularly frequent in patients who did not respond to HBV vaccines, in COVID-naïve patients and in those with lower antibody levels.
Our study has a number of limitations. First, the rate of neutralizing antibodies was not determined, which according to other authors can decrease progressively after the first two doses and can rise very significantly after the third dose. However, other studies have found a significant correlation between anti-S(RBD) antibodies and the neutralizing antibody response, and in our study we found that the changes in anti-S(RBD) IgG antibody levels resemble those described in neutralizing antibodies (18, 19). Another limitation to this study is that cellular immunity was not assessed. It has been described that the response of cellular immunity to vaccination also improves after the third dose (20), and some authors have suggested as a potential predictor of the response to a third dose of the vaccine (12). Since circulating antibody titers are not predictive of T cell memory (35), serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may not reflect the strength and longevity of the immune memory to SARSCoV-2. Finally, the limited number of cases prevents us from drawing solid conclusions about the efficacy of protection against reinfection and its severity (hospitalization and mortality).
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, as a consequence of receiving a third dose of SARSCoV-2 mRNA vaccine, HD patients achieve a better and more sustained humoral immune response over time, which probably translates into lower morbidity and mortality rates in SARS CoV-2 infection. Patients who are most likely to benefit from the

booster dose are COVID-naïve patients and patients who were non-responders to HBV vaccines.

The microbiome innovation has resulted in an umbrella term, postbiotics, which refers to non-viable microbial cells, metabolic byproducts and their microbial components released after lysis. Postbiotics, modulate immune response, gene expression, inhibit pathogen binding, maintain intestinal barriers, help in controlling carcinogenesis and pathogen infections. Postbiotics have antimicrobial, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties with favorable physiological, immunological, neuro-hormonal, regulatory and metabolic reactions. Consumption of postbiotics relieves symptoms of various diseases and viral infections such as SARS-CoV- . Postbiotics can act as alternatives for pre-probiotic specially in immunosuppressed patients, children and premature neonates. Postbiotics are used to preserve and enhance nutritional properties of food, elimination of biofilms and skin conditioning in cosmetics. Postbiotics have numerous advantages over live bacteria with no risk of bacterial translocation from the gut to blood, acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes. The process of extraction, standardization, transport, and storage of postbiotic is more natural. Bioengineering techniques such as fermentation technology, high pressure etc., may be used for the synthesis of di erent postbiotics. Safety assessment and quality assurance of postbiotic is important as they may induce stomach discomfort, sepsis and/or toxic shock. Postbiotics are still in their infancy compared to pre- and pro- biotics but future research in this field may contribute to improved physiological functions and host health. The current review comprehensively summarizes new frontiers of research in postbiotics.

Introduction
According to microbiome researchers, every individual has a distinctive set of microbiota, determined by their DNA and environment. During delivery and lactation, the infant is first exposed to microorganisms (Ursell et al., 2012). The species of microbiome found in the maternal GI flora decides the type of microbiome exposure to the infant. Various factors e.g., genetics, environment, type of delivery, medication and food plays an important role in determining the microbiota inhabiting the colon.

These exposures create a unique microbiome milieu varying from one individual to another individual. Later on, these exposures can change microbiome species which may be either beneficial or detrimental to health (den Besten et al., 2013). Several researchers have suggested various health-promoting effects of gut microbiomes which are dependent on the viability of bacteria. These processes lead to alteration of the gut microbiota, attachment to mucosa and epithelium host cells, improved epithelial function and immune-modulation (Sanders, 2009; Bermudez-Brito et al., 2012; Vyas and Ranganathan, 2012). However, recent research shows that neither all mechanisms nor clinical benefits are directly related to bacterial viability. Thus, viability of microbiome is not essential to attain the health-promoting effects of pre-probiotics. This led to the further research, development and use of nonviable components of microbiome for health benefits. Therefore, current evolving terminologies being added to probiotic scientific literature are postbiotics, ghost probiotics, synbiotics, nutribiotics, para probiotics and pharmabiotics. This paper reviews postbiotics which are non-viable intact microorganisms, their subcellular fractions and metabolic products secreted by live bacteria during their growth or released after bacterial lysis which add nutritional and health advantage to the host wellbeing (Salminen et al., 2021). Diverse antimicrobial compounds are produced that fall into two categories of low molecular weight (i.e., hydrogen peroxide, carbon dioxide, and di-acetylene) and high molecular weight (i.e., bacteriocins and bacteriocins-like substances) compounds which are known as postbiotics (Suskovic´ et al., 2010; de Almeida Júnior et al., 2015). Lactobacillus is the most researched bacteria among the various LAB (Lactic acid bacteria) which is used for production of postbiotics.
Another major aspect in postbiotics research is their inherent stability, both during industrial processes and storage. As postbiotics are not able to replicate, thay are safer than probiotics. Thus, they are unable to cause probiotic associated risks like bacteraemia, fungaemia etc. (Yelin et al., 2019). Postbiotics are characterized by the microorganisms used as the starting point for its production and also the inactivation procedure or technique used for its production, as each procedure affects the quality and quantity of the final postbiotic produced & results in a different postbiotic with varied effects. However, for wider acceptance of postbiotics, an expert consensus is needed on the exact definition of postbiotics. The International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement unlocked the mystery of postbiotic action by five mechanisms: modulation of the resident microbiota; enhancement of epithelial barrier functions; modulation of local and systemic immune responses; modulation of systemic metabolic responses; and systemic signaling via the nervous system (Salminen et al., 2021). Therefore, postbiotics research in humans and validation of

clinical & non clinical benefits of these bioactive molecules is the need of the hour. Novel postbiotics formulation may open a new horizon resulting in new therapeutic and preventive clinical approaches in diseases like diabetes mellitus, wound healing, adjunctive therapeutic drug as well as in food biopreservation, food packaging, biofilm control, functional food, food supplements, pharma food etc. To summarize, postbiotics research unfolded the concept of microbial metabolites in the sustenance of health.
Concept of postbiotics
In 2019, ISAPP convened a panel of experts specializing in nutrition, microbial physiology, gastroenterology, pediatrics, food science and microbiology to review the definition and scope of postbiotics (Yelin et al., 2019; Salminen et al., 2021). The panel defined a postbiotic as a "preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit on the host". Effective postbiotics must contain inactivated microbial cells or cell components, with or without metabolites, that contribute to observed health benefits (Yelin et al., 2019). Their beneficial effect can be judged or confirmed in humans, animals, and other target organs and should not be limited only to the intestine. Further, the panel concluded that postbiotics are deliberately inactivated microbes that may contain metabolites or cell components exhibiting health benefits. Furthermore, there must be confirmed local as well as systemic health benefits, on the target population which can include humans, companion animals, livestock and other targets. Excluding injections, postbiotics can be administered anywhere at a host surface provided they have a safe profile. However, purified microbial metabolites and vaccines were excluded from postbiotics definition. Postbiotic may not necessarily be derived from a probiotic.
Various researchers reported beneficial effects of postbiotics such as immunomodulatory, antimicrobial and anti-cancer activity. It causes reduction in inflammation, oxidative stress, proliferative properties, reduction in blood pressure, cholesterol level and body weight. Postbiotics are well-tolerated in healthy people. However, certain groups of people should avoid increasing their level of postbiotics through eating probiotic rich foods e.g., people who have recently had surgery, have structural heart disorders, with digestive tract disorders, pregnant females and children. These groups tend to have compromised immune systems and may therefore be at an increased risk of an adverse reaction.
Certain foods may improve postbiotics in the gut e.g., buttermilk, cottage cheese, fermented pickles, yogurt, high-fiber foods like oats, flaxseed and garlic. Various researchers reported that internal and external factors may affect the performance of postbiotics. The interaction between active metabolites of

postbiotic and internal factors like the resident microbiota, enzymes, and various food components can inhibit metabolites functions (Rad et al., 2020). Proteolytic enzymes are associated with postbiotic dysfunctions (Izuddin et al., 2020; Humam et al., 2021). The most important proteolytic enzymes are pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin etc., which have been shown to interfere with the activity of postbiotic compounds. External food factors like hydrogen ion concentration of food alters the antimicrobial activity of postbiotics, the optimal activity of postbiotics being reported between pH 4 and 9. Out of the food types used in postbiotics research, pasteurized milk and ground meat have an optimal pH, therefore they cause no disturbance in the function of postbiotics (Moradi et al., 2020). Another external factor affecting the antimicrobial activity of postbiotics is temperature variation. Heat at 30C for 30 min or at 121C for 15 min, decreases the antimicrobial effect of postbiotics (Mirnejad et al., 2013). Therefore, temperature and pH control is critical for the production of postbiotics.
The concept of postbiotics is fairly recent in comparison to prebiotics and probiotics. Postbiotic supplements are not as extensively available yet but postbiotics are superior to probiotics because of their purity, ease of preparation, long shelf life, mass production capability, precise action and more targeted responses by specific ligand-receptor interactions (Nataraj et al., 2020). Therefore, researchers are using postbiotics to modulate microbial signatures of health, nutrition and disease status.
Postbiotic components: Production and characterization
Over trillions of microbes carrying more than 3 million genes are estimated to inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract (GI), the main site being the large intestine that carry the most diverse and metabolically active microbial community (Belizário and Napolitano, 2015). The microbial colonization of the fetus seems to start in the uterus through ingestion of amniotic fluid and continues even after birth constituting the human microbiota (microbiome) unique to an individual (Tanaka and Nakayama, 2017; Toda et al., 2019). It includes more than 1,000 microbial species and is crucial for human development.
The gut microbiome of an individual shows family inheritance and comprises both beneficial and harmful microbes. A very delicate balance exists between the two and any disturbance in this normal microflora (dysbiosis) not only affects the GI tract but also negatively impacts the functions of other organs. This increases the risk of various infections and chronic diseases like colon dysfunction, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, autism, psychiatric disturbances and other metabolic problems (Carding et al., 2015). It has been shown by a number of studies that this balance can be restored

through use of postbiotics which in comparison to pre- and probiotics pose less risk (De Marco et al., 2018).
There are a number of investigations suggesting that the beneficial effects of probiotics in health may not necessarily be related to microorganisms' viability. Many of the health benefits of pre-, pro- and syn-biotics appeared to be mediated by various metabolic products, cellular and subcellular structural components and intact or ruptured dead microbes. Postbiotics are the structural and metabolic microbial products that include cell free supernatants, bacterial lysates, cell wall fragments, teichoic acid, short chain fatty acids, vitamins, enzymes, exopolysaccharide, various peptides, amino acids, and fermentation by-products (Wegh et al., 2019). These postbiotics components are produced by probiotics on feeding on prebiotics, during their prolonged storage or processing like pasteurization, baking or during metabolic processes. Besides these can also be produced in the lab by using methods such as radiations (UV/ionizing), high pressure, high temperature, sonication and inactivation by formalin.
Number of yeasts and bacteria used as probiotic but their use as postbiotic is underexploited. As postbiotics provide a safe alternative to live probiotics, the focus in recent time has shifted on postbiotics studies. Probiotic yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii has been used in many functional foods including dairy foods, grains, coffee, fruit juices etc. However, researchers need to develop postbiotic based functional foods preparations of S. boulardii, which may possibly improve shelf stability, sensorial properties, safety, and health benefits (Chan and Liu, 2022). Researches are being conducted to isolate and characterize different postbiotic components employing advanced technologies and to investigate their bioactivities for futuristic therapeutic use in medicine (Pyclik et al., 2020). Metabolomic methods are nowadays used to estimate the metabolic products of microbiota in stool and serum (Zhao et al., 2017). Many commercial pharmaceutical products like Nyaditum resea (inactivated Mycobacterium), Lacteol (inactivated Lactobacillus sp.), Cytoflora (cw components of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium sp.) are already approved for their use as supplements, immunomodulators and controlling risk of infections (Barros et al., 2020).
The storage and transportation of viable probiotic products requires cold chains whereas postbiotics are more stable and do not require cold chains for their industrial use. There is no interaction of postbiotics with the food matrix, no risk of acquiring antibiotic resistance genes and also no undesirable changes in taste and aroma. So postbiotics are a safe substitute in individuals with immune deficiencies, with transplantation or for newborns. Postbiotics act both locally and/or systematically on other organs through the communication axis between gut and target organs like Gut brain axis, Gut lung axis, gut-liver axis (Nataraj et al., 2020). The main postbiotic components as shown in Figure 1.

Postbiotic components: production and characterization.

Inactivated and dead probiotics (non-viable probiotics)
Heat is the most commonly used method to produce non-viable preparation though other methods like gamma or ultraviolet radiations, tyndallization, sonication and chemical treatment can also be used. The cellular composition and biological activities differ with the inactivation process (Taverniti and Guglielmetti, 2011). Studies conducted on experimental models revealed that the non-viable cells retain the biological properties of their viable counterparts like scavenging oxygen radicals, decreasing inflammatory markers and modulating host physiology (Sugahara et al., 2017). Both the live and heat killed cells of eight Lactobacillus reuteri strains tested were themselves adherent to caco 2 cell culture, and inhibit the adherence of entero pathogens viz E. coli, Salmonella typhi, Listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus faecalis to these cells (Singh et al., 2017).
Cell free suspensions
Various biologically active metabolites are produced during microbial growth that can be separated from microbial cells by centrifugation and found to be rich in antioxidants, phenolics, flavonoid, antimicrobics and anticancer compounds (Hamad et al., 2020). These are reported to increase the expression of

anti-inflammatory cytokines e.g., IL-10 and decrease the proinflammatory e.g., TNF, IL-1.
Lee et al. (2020) explored the anticancer property of the cell free culture filtrate from Lactobacillus fermentum and noted its anti-proliferative effects on 3D spheroid cultures of colorectal cancer cells. In another study cell free supernatant from Lactobacillus reuten, probably containing carbohydrates and fatty acid metabolites showed the anti-bacterial activity against dental pathogenic bacteria and seems to have potential in prevention and treatment of dental caries and periodontal diseases (Yang et al., 2021). Antimicrobial potential was also noted in culture suspensions from four probiotic strains viz
Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. fermentum, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Pediococcus acidilactici against Clostridium perfringens present in poultry meat, indicating future applications of CFS in controlling clostridium infections (Hamad et al., 2020).
A measurable amount of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, protein and diacetyl were detected in Lactobacillus and Pediococcus species culture filtrate that are inhibitory to Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus (George-Okafor et al., 2020). The inhibition seems to occur by formation of pores in cell membranes and cell lysis due to lactic acid followed by action of diacetyl and bacteriocins (Oscáriz and Pisabarro, 2001). The culture suspension of oral care probiotic Weissella cibaria strain CMU found to have hydrogen peroxide, fatty acids, secreted proteins and organic acids. Antibacterial activity against

periodontal pathogens was demonstrated by organic acid, secreted proteins and hydrogen peroxide (Lim et al., 2018) through disrupting cell membrane, decline in cytosol pH, production of hydroxyl radical, and interfering with cellular metabolic function (Konings et al., 1989).
In comparison to purified bio molecules, CFS appears to have better biological effects on host health as different biomolecules work in collaboration (Hartmann et al., 2011). On characterization, CSF from the various investigated species of lactobacilli using GC-MS was found to contain Pyrrolo [1,2a] pyrazine-1,4-dione. Other compounds including organic acid like butyric acid, benzoic acid, biosurfactants (laurostearic acid), various peptides, fatty acid, ethanol, phenol, cyclopentanes, esters, and aldehyde are also present in strain specific manner. Many of these compounds show antioxidant activity, biofilm removal and antagonistic ability against L. monocytogenes, indicating their potential use as food additive especially of L. salivarius (Moradi et al., 2020). The antibacterial activity of Enterococcus faecalis CFS against foodborne pathogens was thermostable and maximum at neutral pH (7), indicating its application in food preservation (de Las M Cardoso et al., 2012).
Exo polysaccharides and extracellular vesicles
Different types of homo- and hetero-polysaccharides like kefricin,  glucans, uronic acid etc. are produced by Lactobacilli and other microbes. These are as a group termed as exopolysaccharides that are released either extracellularly or remain attached firmly as a capsule or loosely as a slime layer to the microbial cell surface (Caggianiello et al., 2016).
These macromolecules not only provide protection to microorganisms from phages, phagocytes and toxic compounds but also influences hosts' immunity, physiological mechanisms, lipid metabolism, and pathogen colonization. Dinic´ et al. (2018) showed the reduction in proinflammatory (IL-I, TNF, iNOS) and simultaneous increase in anti-inflammatory (IL-6, IL-10) cytokines, thus reducing the inflammation in rats on using EPS from Lactobacillus paraplantarum BGCG11. They were the first to show the counter hyperalgesia effect of an EPS. The EPS obtained from probiotics Lactobacillus fermentum and Paenibacillus polymyxa cultures showed antioxidant activity and thus may have health benefits in diseases like diabetes, arthrosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis (Liu et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2020). Moreover, EPS isolated from lactic acid bacilli exhibited activity against tumor progress and inflammation as well as inhibited biofilm formation by pathogenic E.coli and S. aureus (Wang et al., 2020).
EPS from certain bacteria, particularly gut commensals, also show their expanded applications in bioremediation, pharmaceutical, food, and textiles industry (Angelin and

Kavitha, 2020). Few exopolysaccharides already in use as food additives or in pharma industries include dextran, xanthan, alginate, gellen, and pullulan (Moscovici, 2015).
EPS extraction from LAB culture is a multi step process involving centrifugation followed by protein removal by acid, precipitation by cold ethanol, filtration to remove small molecules, finally dialysis and lyophilization (Jurásková et al., 2022). EPS preparations vary in their structure and composition depending on the source, thus impacting its bioactive functionalities.
EVs are lipid bilayer membrane bound spherical structures released by commensal bacteria like E.coli, Akkermansia muciniphila. These enclose diverse compounds like proteins, DNA, RNA, glycolipids, polysaccharides, enzymes, etc. and are involved in horizontal transfer of genetic material among bacterial species. These compounds are reported to play a role in controlling gut barrier permeability, signaling pathways, maintaining intestinal homeostasis, improving lipid profile and communication between gut and brain (Ahmadi Badi et al., 2017; Chelakkot et al., 2018).
Cell envelope components and pili
Bacterial cell wall consists of two macromolecules; lipopolysaccharide (in Gram negatives) and peptidoglycan (both in Gram positives and Gram negatives) that are released continuously during bacterial cell growth and death. Peptidoglycan is a rigid complex structure made of sugar and amino acid (Schaefer et al., 2018) and constitutes 30-70% of the Gram-positive cell wall. It consists of teichoic acids, polysaccharides and proteins. Teichoic acids are negatively charged molecules present only in Gram positives and are grouped into two types; (i) wall teichoic acid and (ii) lipo teichoic acids on the basis of their anchoring to peptidoglycan and cell membranes, respectively (Swoboda et al., 2009). Bacterial cell wall components are involved in host signaling as well in adhesion (Pyclik et al., 2020). These are excellent effector macromolecule and involved in activating immune system and release of various cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF, and IFN; hyper release of which may result in pathophysiological reactions like septic shock, multiple organ failure, etc. (Hamann et al., 1998). Various peptidoglycan fragments released by action of endogenous peptidoglycan hydrolases are involved in modulation of host response. Two peptidoglycan hydrolases; proteins p75 and p40 from probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus were demonstrated to maintain the integrity of gut lining and suppress programmed cell death (Yan et al., 2007).
Several investigations indicated the boost in innate immunity, mast cell stimulation and immune regulatory mechanisms by LTA showing its immunogenicity. By suppressing regulatory activity of CD 25+ regulatory T

cells and increasing cell mediated immunity, teichoic acid (LTA) of Bifidobacterium along with 5-fluorouracil regresses the proliferation of hepatoma cells indicating its anticancer property (Guo et al., 2015). The increase in T regulatory cells Foxp3+ was noted with B. bifidum cell wall polysaccharides (Verma et al., 2018). Hickey et al. (2021) observed a rise in the level of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-, IFN-, IL-12, when B. breve lacked the EPS and suggested the involvement of EPS in establishing mutual relationship between host and B. breve. Bifidobacterium sp. EPS demonstrated to increase the level of IL-10 ( inflammatory) but decline INF (pro-inflammatory) cytokines.
The investigators have also studied the role of pili as postbiotics which are long extracellular extensions on the cell surface and play a role in cell adhesion to intestinal wall or aggregation of bacteria. Bacterial pili is also involved in the development of the immune system in infants by modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (Bach, 2002).
Bacterial lysates
Bacterial lysates are the soluble factors liberated by bacterial cell lysis. These can be prepared by sonication and mimic the presence of bacteria. These lysates pose multiple health benefits and are reported to decrease the inflammatory conditions like ulcerative colitis. The development of inflammatory bowel diseases like colitis and Crohn's disease is prevented by cell lysate from Lactobacillus caseii & other postbiotics including short chain fatty acids & tryptophan; thus providing a complementary treatment for inflammatory diseases. This probably results by correcting the gut microbiome, improving intestinal barrier integrity, modulating local & systemic immune response, regulating immune cells functions, reducing inflammation, and inhibiting the growth of pathogens (Zakostelska et al., 2011; Russo et al., 2019). Mi et al. (2022) observed the immune enhancing effect of cell lysate from Bacillus velezensis (Kh 2-2) derived from Korean fermented food Squid Jeotgal through in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo studies. The lysate was reported to increase the cytokine production, promote specific and nonspecific immune responses and activate macrophages.
The study done on rats using the supernatant and cell lysate from five probiotic strains i.e., Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. reuteri, L. casei, Bifidobacterium longum and B. coagulans were found to increase the bone mineral density at multiple bone sites in species dependent manner. The use of lysate appear to be an alternative for maintaining bone health and treating osteoporosis in elderly and women post menopause (MontazeriNajafabady et al., 2021).
Bifidobacterium longum lysate was found to improve the reactive skin by controlling vasodilatation, oedema, degranulation of mast cells and other inflammation parameters

(Guéniche et al., 2009). Moreover, use of both live and lysate of probiotic strain Lactobacillus reuter DSM 17938 in ex vivo skin models also illustrated the decline in proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) and thus may give a new approach for managing skin inflammation and keeping skin healthy. Therefore, numerous skin care brands are also incorporating bacterial lysates in their formulations (Khmaladze et al., 2019).
Suppression of colorectal tumor cell proliferation, cell necrosis and invasion was reported on using cell lysate of two Lactobacillus species i.e., L. acidophilus and L. casei (Dallal et al., 2015). Heat shock culture lysate of L. plantarum appeared more potent inducer of immune response than normal cell lysate in cancer patients. Increased expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in heat shocked lysate may be associated with enhancement of cytokine expression and cytotoxic T cells activation (Sanaei et al., 2021).
Bioactive metabolites
The number of low and high molecular weight substances are produced by beneficial microbes in the gut or during fermentation in culture. There is a need to optimize the fermentation conditions for maximal yield of various metabolites. Amiri et al. (2021) optimized the conditions for simultaneous production of three metabolites viz. conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), exopolysaccharides (EPSs), and bacteriocins (BACs) by Bifidobacterium lactis using cheese whey and permeates, otherwise a waste, as the culture medium. As reviewed by Moradi et al. (2020), the chemical composition can be analyzed qualitatively or quantitatively employing various new techniques including two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC), spectrophotometric technique, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The composition and functional attributes depend on the microbial strains, culture conditions and processing conditions. The major ones include:
Vitamins
Humans require exogenous sources of vitamins as they lack the biochemical pathways for their synthesis. These vitamins are required in various physiological processes like folate in DNA replication, repair and methylation, vitamin K as cofactor of gamma carboxylase activity in blood clotting, bone health, neural functions, and riboflavin in redox reactions as hydrogen carrier. Gut commensal especially lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacterium sp. supply many of these essential vitamins

that include vitamin K and many B group vitamins like folate, riboflavin, cobalamin, pyridoxine, thymine, niacin, nicotinic acid (Hill, 1997; LeBlanc et al., 2013). A variety of fermented foods like fermented milk, yogurt, and cheese are rich sources supplying these vitamins. While the vitamins produced by the gut commensals are mainly absorbed in the colon, the main absorption site for dietary vitamins is the small intestine.
Neurotransmitters
Neurotransmitters like serotonins, dopamines, norepinephrine, catecholamines, acetylcholines are produced in gut lumen by commensals like Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Bacillus subtilis, etc. These impact the brain function via gut brain axis through modulation of enteric nerves signaling. Serotonin derived from amino acid tryptophan is involved in elevating the mood. While catecholamines and acetylcholine play a critical role in CNS functions like memory and learning processes, emotion, motor control, gamma amino butyric acid acts as neurotransmission inhibitor and its dysfunction results in anxiety and depression. These compounds seem to have potential as antidepressants and psychiatric related disorders can be taken care of by microbiota management (Patterson et al., 2014).
Biosurfactants
Biosurfactants are amphiphilic compounds excreted generally at the end of the exponential phase by microbes either extracellularly or remain bound to the cell surface. The major ones include glycolipids, glycoproteins, phospholipids, fatty acids, polysaccharides and glycopeptides (Cameotra and Makkar, 2010). These surface-active macromolecules possess anti-bacterial and anti-film properties. By preventing the establishment of biofilm or removing the existing one, biosurfactants help in preventing the colonization by the enteropathogens (Satpute et al., 2016). These also disrupt the cell membrane integrity and outflow of cytoplasmic content of pathogens. Bio surfactants can be obtained and characterized by centrifugation, acidification, extraction, membrane filtration, dialysis, gel filtration, freeze drying, FTIR, TLC, NMR, MS.
Short chain fatty acids
These are produced in the colon from indigestible carbohydrates, oligo- and poly- saccharides, mainly dietary fibers by Bacteroides and Firmicutes. As evidenced, SCFs have multiple health benefits. Besides improving the colon's function and lowering the pH, these enhance the proliferation of epithelial cells and the blood flow in the colon (Topping, 1996). SCFs also play an important role in lowering the incidence of colo-rectal diseases (Bird et al., 2010). Major fatty acids produced by colonic bacteria on fermentation of undigested carbohydrates

are acetate, propionate and butyrate, with ratios varying usually from 3:1:1 to 10:2:1. Acetate is used by other microbes as a growth factor and also involved in cholesterol management. Propionate and butyrate are involved in gluconeogenesis and are the key supplier of energy for colonocytes and epithelial cells (Rowland et al., 2017) and also promote apoptosis of colon cancerous cells. Some amounts of lactate, succinate and fumarate may also be present as fermentation products. SCFs can play a crucial role in clinical trials and more holistic approaches can help to study the interactions between postbiotics, host and gut microbiota.
Bacteriocins
Bacteriocins comprise a large heterogeneous group of more than hundreds ribosomally synthesized small peptides or proteins produced both by lactic acid (LAB) and other eubacteria and archaebacteria that can kill or inhibit the growth of other bacteria. Examples include nisin, subtilosin, lactococcin G&Q, enterocin, lactocyclicin, bovicin, plantaricin, lacticin etc. (Perez et al., 2014). These vary in their molecular weight, structure and activity and have been classified into three classes: heat stable Class I Bacteriocins/Lantibiotics (e.g., nisin, mersacidin, lacticin) that are modified highly after translation; heat stable Class II-bacteriocins (lactacin F, lactococcin G, pediocin PA-1, sakacin A) that are not modified much posttranslationally; and heat-labile Class III bacteriocins (colicins, megacins, enterolysin, helveticin I) (Negash and Tsehai, 2020). Bacteriocins show their potential in food preservation. Nisin was the first bacteriocin that was given approval by regulatory authorities like European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), FDA, Health Canada for its commercial use as food preservative and now it is being used in more than 80 countries as a food additive. Bacteriocins inhibit growth of pathogens in GIT through pore formation in cell membranes, inhibiting correct cell wall formation and inhibiting enzyme activity and protein functions. Belguesmia et al. (2020) and Kim et al. (2020) isolated multi-bacteriocinogenic strain of Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus taiwanensis that demonstrated antimicrobial activity against E. coli and Salmonella gallinarum & enteropathogenic E. coli, respectively. Moreover, they exhibit narrow to broad spectrum inhibitory activity against bacterial growth, thus drawing attention for their therapeutic use as next generation antimicrobials in controlling global threat of drug resistant infectious organisms (Soltani et al., 2020). Besides, bacteriocins are also reported to possess anticancer activity and antiviral activity. Despite their positive characteristics like odorless, colorless, biodegradability, their widespread use in medicine, cancer therapy, food, cosmetics, veterinary use, require more research on their safety, toxicity, and immunogenicity.

Hydrogen peroxide
It is another postbiotic produced by many bacteria including LAB that has antimicrobial effect and helps in improving inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) conditions marked by disintegrated tight junctions and increased intestinal permeability. Hydrogen peroxide synthesized by eight different L. johnsonii strains and L. gasseri is observed to kill the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Pridmore et al., 2008). It is found to provide protection against a number of viruses by inducing antibody and T cell response. It is therefore proposed that gargling and nasal spray of H2O2 may be effective against SARS-2 COVID through increase in localized innate immune response (Caruso et al., 2020). Singh et al. (2018) reported in their study that increasing H2O2 production by L. johnsonii within the physiological range enhances the recovery from colitis.
Possible signaling mechanisms
The signaling mechanism of postbiotics depends on the interaction of host and microbial products through MAMPs (microbe-associated molecular patterns) of commensals with specific PRRs (pattern recognition receptors) on host cells (Figure 2). These MAMPs include various surface molecules like teichoic acids, polysaccharides, cell wall proteins, nucleic acid etc. and the main PRRs involved are TLRs (Toll-Like Receptors), NLRs (Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain-Like Receptors), CTLRs (C-Type Lectin-Like Receptors) and GPCRs (G-Protein-Coupled Receptors) (Teame et al., 2020). This interaction activate the host immune system and eventually lead to anti-inflammatory response (immunomodulation), and have health promoting effects like anti-carcinogenic, hypolipidemic and hypertensive properties (Fang et al., 2014; Aguilar-Toalá et al., 2019; Engevik et al., 2021; Ye¸silyurt et al., 2021).
Although the precise mechanisms have not been fully elucidated, postbiotics like SCFs bind to the specific receptors (GPCRs) present on the intestinal epithelium and obstruct Treg (Regulatory T cells) cell suppression, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and NF-B (Nuclear factor kappa B) pathway of neutrophils and macrophages which hinder the inflammatory response and anti-inflammatory effect is generated (Park et al., 2007; Vinolo et al., 2011). Similarly EPS, peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid binds to specific TLRs and through inhibition of enteropathogen mediated NF-B and MAPK (Mitogen-activated protein kinases) signal pathways downregulate inflammatory cytokines and modulate inflammatory conditions in gut inflammation (Lebeer et al., 2011; Wachi et al., 2014). Peptidoglycan peptides via binding to NLRs (intracellular proteins e.g., NOD1 & NOD2) upregulate proinflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial activity by

regulating NF-B, MAPK, and caspase-1 signals (Franchi et al., 2009). Immunomodulation also occurs on up- and downregulation of several signaling pathways. Postbiotics seems to promote the secretion of IL-10 and in turn stimulate Foxp3+ T regulatory cells and suppress the release of IL-6, IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) (Teame et al., 2020). Polysaccharide A (PSA) from Bacterioides fragilis, also enhances IL-10 and T cell mediated regulation and inhibits IL-17 production, thus managing inflammation progression (Peluzio et al., 2021).
In some cases, it is observed that heat-killed microbes can trigger the transcription of toll-like receptors and expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Wang et al., 2013). Cytokine IL-8 plays an important role in inflammatory response by recruiting the immune cells. While some strains of heat-killed bacteria obstruct IL-8 secretion in intestinal cells by secreting soluble anti-inflammatory factors which can initiate cellular immune and anti-inflammatory response (Kamiya et al., 2006; Imaoka et al., 2008). It is hypothesized that postbiotics protect hosts from pathobionts by immunomodulatory boosting the levels of Th1-associated cytokines and suppress the Th2- associated cytokines (de Almada et al., 2016). Immunosenescence with age particularly in elders under nutritional control results in decreased efficacy of the vaccination. Akatsu (2021) reviewed the interventions by gut modulation on the elders' immunity and as evidenced by some studies administering pre-, pro- and post- biotic raised the NK cells & phagocytic activity, increase the antibody titer & cytokine production, thus highlighting the potential adjuvant function in vaccination. However, more clinical studies on a larger group of subjects is required.
Postbiotics are emerging anticancer agents due to their non-hydrolytic stable chemical structure, longer shelf life and nontoxicity (Nataraj et al., 2020). Postbiotics are able to modulate immune response by inhibiting mutagenesis and bacterial translocation and triggering pro-apoptotic pathways, apoptosis and autophagy. By inducing apoptosis and altering expression of ZO-1 and MMP-9 (responsible for maintaining & degrading tight junctions, respectively), SCFs prevent cancer progression (Zólkiewicz et al., 2020). Abnormalities in gut microbiota can be a cause of host's tumorigenesis, especially colorectal cancer. Growth of pathogens can affect the immune system by secreting toxins which cause mutation in host's DNA hence inducing tumor development (Mager, 2006).
Postbiotics also have antiatheroschlerotic effects and help in lipid metabolism by lowering the risk of various cardiovascular diseases. Some examples include Lactobacillus bacteria which boost the production of HDL cholesterol and lowers the level of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. SCFA also leads to statinlike effects by obstructing the condensation of the cholesterol precursors (Olle, 2013).
However, more advanced genomic approaches including metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, need to be

employed for better understanding of complex host- postbiotic interactions and their benefits (Wegh et al., 2019).
Health and nutritional benefits of postbiotics through the life cycle
There is no dearth of evidence highlighting health benefits of consuming prebiotics and probiotics. However, advances in research have indicated that many of these health benefits actually come from the production of postbiotics. The microbial metabolites and other molecules that are generated in the fermented foods are responsible for the health benefits of postbiotics. The composition of the postbiotic product depends on the various processing methods involved. Postbiotics have been found to influence nearly every physiological function in the human body. The health promoting and disease preventive benefits of postbiotics throughout the life-cycle are summarized in Table 1.
The spectrum of health and nutritional benefits of postbiotics is growing with advancing research and many distinct features are still emerging. However, it is also important to note that some adverse concerns have been reported after consumption of postbiotics in specific groups of people which warrants a need to further investigate safe use of postbiotics.

Perspectives for non-clinical application
Food applications
A notable use of postbiotics can be found in the food safety profile for example biopreservation and packaging, removal of biofilm, degradation of toxic contaminants.
Biopreservation
In biopreservation, specific microorganisms and their metabolites are used as postbiotics to prevent the microbial spoilage of food and to enhance their shelf life. Postbiotics exhibit anti-microbial activity on both pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms by multiple mechanisms including creating cavities in CM, affecting cell wall proteins and decreasing pH of bacteria cytoplasm, thus proving to be of considerable significance in the food sector (Homayouni Rad et al., 2021). Non-vegetarian food can be preserved by directly applying the postbiotic coating (for example fish filet and meat slices) or spraying (for example ground fish and meat), depending upon the nature of the postbiotic and type of the meat to protect their nutritional properties and organoleptic changes.

xylosus reduce the number of Salmonella typhimurium in chicken drumstick (Incili et al., 2022). Dietary inclusion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation products may be a potential intervention to control Salmonella enterica in Poultry foods (Chaney et al., 2022). Postbiotic-containing preservatives were found to be equally effective as commonly used commercial preservatives in preserving vacuum-packaged cooked sausages, thus providing natural preservation technologies ( de Lima et al., 2022). Although, these studies need to be substantiated with more robust in vivo trials.
Similarly, more extensive studies are required to elucidate the bactericidal effect of various LAB strains in the food sector. Postbiotics also aids in the biopreservation of dairy products since the viability of probiotic strains can be affected by extrinsic or intrinsic factors. Postbiotics can be used as a biocontrol alternative for making dairy products, fruits and vegetables safe. For instance, for controlling cheese blowing defects the role of different bacteriocins and bacteriocin-producing LAB is reported. Postbiotics can also be used as sanitizers in food industries (Moradi et al., 2020).
Functional food preparation
Host immune stimulation can be achieved primarily through the functional foods prepared using postbiotics. Milk fortified using postbiotics derived from B. breve and S. thermophilus reduces food intolerance and/or respiratory allergic reactions in early childhood (Scarpellini et al., 2021).
Food packaging
To improve the shelf-life of food, an active packaging approach is used which involves an interaction between food, packaging material and surrounding environment. This active postbiotic packaging system involves preservation and prevents microbial deterioration during delivery to the consumer. To increase the stability, the postbiotic can be applied in various ways such as thin coating or by covalent linkage for

immobilization or by adding in the packaging matrix or by lamination on the polymer (Hosseini et al., 2021). Various types of postbiotic packaging are based on organic acids, peptides and bacteriocins. Organic acids are key candidates of postbiotics and are suitable anti-microbial factors. Lactic acid, citric acid and acetic acid disturbs the growth of pathogens by decreasing the cytoplasmic pH and membrane function. Through their pleiotropic action mechanisms, peptides and bacteriocins degrade the cell membrane, prevent synthesis of macromolecules and block microbial growth (Hosseini et al., 2021).
Sensory acceptability of postbiotics
Presence of postbiotics may change the sensory characteristics of foods, necessitating the need to evaluate different postbiotics containing foods for their sensory acceptability. Sensory evaluation of Functional Yogurt Enriched with Cape Gooseberry (Physalis peruviana L.) containing postbiotics produced by E. coli (Darwish et al., 2022) indicated consumer acceptance was significantly higher for most sensory aspects like appearance, smoothness, sourness, mouthfeel, and overall acceptance. The only aspect which was undesirable in comparison to the control sample was the color of the product. However, there was a significant decline in sensory properties of all yogurt samples with progressing storage periods (Darwish et al., 2022). In another study, sensory parameters of the lamb meat slices preserved using edible coating containing postbiotics of Lactobacillus paracasei ATCC 55544 (PLP) were assessed during cold storage. The results reveal that the sensory acceptability of samples preserved using edible coating were greater than the uncoated samples and there were no significant changes in color, appearance, and overall acceptance of the coated lamb meat slices throughout the storage period (Ozma et al., 2022). Similar results were demonstrated in a study done by Kamble et al. (2017), in which it was reported that application of postbiotics by spray method reduced the bacterial population on cold beef carcass

surfaces without affecting the sensory specifications of meat. Garnier et al. (2019), investigated the sensory aspects of sour cream and semi-hard cheese to which postbiotics from LAB were added primarily to inhibit fungal spoilage. The study concluded that postbiotics significantly reduced the fungal population of cheese without affecting sensory acceptance, whereas postbiotics at 2 and 5% (w/w) concentrations had negative effects on the sensory attributes in sour cream. A review on postbiotics produced by lactic acid bacteria concluded that the postbiotics mixture or their purified metabolites are effective as packaging material or surface coatings which have the ability to prolong the shelf life of perishable foods without altering their sensory characteristics (Moradi et al., 2020). Given the health and nutritional benefits of postbiotics and minimal evidence of adverse effect on sensory characteristics of food, use of postbiotics should be promoted by food technologists and scientists.
Removal of biofilms
Biofilms are made of microbial polysaccharide or protein matrix. Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus are biofilm-forming bacteria in the food sector. Biofilms are difficult to remove by conventional cleaning methods and disinfection. Postbiotics have antimicrobial properties and can destroy biofilms formed by bacteria. A study shows that Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5, Lactobacillus casei 431, and Lactobacillus salivarius demonstrates antimicrobial effect on a biofilm formed by L. monocytogenes on the polystyrene surfaces. It further demonstrated that biofilm reduction of L. monocytogene is brought about by bacteriocin and organic acid-based postbiotics. Therefore, postbiotics are utilized as an agent for the reduction of biofilm formation by pathogens in the food sector (Homayouni Rad et al., 2021). The Non-clinical application of Posbiotics are summarized in Figure 3.
Cosmetic applications
The human skin provides the first-line defense against external agents and acts as a physical and immunological barrier. Aggravation of skin diseases causes dysbiosis of the microbiome on the skin. In patients with acne there is a change in microbiota, which is dominated by C. acnes and S. epidermis. Scientific evidence indicates that use of topical probiotics reduces the number of acne causing bacteria like S. epidermidis, S. aureus, S. pyogenes and C. acnes (Lee et al., 2019). Bacteriocin from E. faecalis SL-5 containing lotion was found to reduce the inflammation in acne lesions. At acidic pH conditions, LactoSporin, an antimicrobial, heat stable peptide derived from Bacillus coagulans is suggested to be highly effective as a topical formulation (Majeed et al., 2020).

Biological doping
Biological doping is the new area for postbiotic application. Evidence suggests that overall physical performance of mice is increased by conversion of lactic acid to propionate, by the intestinal Veillonella species. The run-to exhaustion time increased in mice after administration of propionate, thereby showing a positive relationship with physical performance (Fernández-Sanjurjo et al., 2020). The Non-clinical use of Posbiotics are summarized in Table 2.
Future prospects
Biotics research shows that postbiotics are better alternatives to probiotics, due to their similar beneficial health effects and minimal risk of introducing live microbes. This is particularly beneficial for preterm infants and people with compromised defense systems. Although the microorganisms metabolites are being explored as a therapeutic option for a devastating intestinal disease called necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) which affects premature or very low birth weight infants. Postbiotics can also be helpful in treating diseases like Alzheimer's disease or multiple sclerosis, whose effective therapies are still not found (Goswami et al., 2018).
Precision postbiotics
Another futuristic direction of postbiotic research is development of model "precision postbiotics" for effective therapeutic and preventive medicine. Precision medicine emphasizes on the medical treatment customized according to the patient instead of one drug that fits all models. So development of precision postbiotics for specific illness in specific subgroups of patients is an interesting proposition (Goswami et al., 2018; Veiga et al., 2020).
Nanotechnology
Nanotechnology's use in nutraceuticals has exploded in recent years, thanks to its capacity to improve the bioavailability of concentrated active components, leading to better therapeutic/nutraceutical results and necessitating the creation of nano nutraceuticals from nutritious elements such as antioxidants, vitamins, fatty acids etc. Natural chemical substances of medicinal importance include bioactive micro and macromolecules (postbiotics) produced by gut beneficial microorganisms. Currently, a novel treatment technique has been created that focuses on the microbiome's tiny molecular weight biomolecules, which provide the host with a variety of physiological health advantages.

literature authenticates that active targeting systems based on nanoparticles can be used as an innovative and convenient approach for controlled delivery of postbiotics in-vivo. Administration of postbiotics is still in its early stages, and if it is to be widely used as a therapeutic strategy, it will require substantial research and randomized double-blind clinical studies (Nile et al., 2020).
Biomarkers for viral infections
According to the latest research, postbiotics structure and metabolic activity can be used as biomarkers for predicting viral diseases such as the coronavirus disease, and hence they can be helpful in the controlling COVID pandemic (Gou et al., 2020). CSFs from Lactobacillus plantarum Probio88 found to contain the spread of coronavirus indicating microbiome modification approach may be used along with other therapies including vaccines against highly infectious pathogens (Rather et al., 2021).

Despite extensive research in postbiotics, there is still a lack of knowledge in the mechanistic actions to validate their health claims. Future research in postbiotics can pave the way toward turning microorganisms into functional ingredients. Postbiotics research can lead to an intersection of various fields like food, microbiology, health and personalized treatment.
Conclusion
To summarize, this review provides an overview of postbiotics as an emerging concept within the "-biotics" family, though the exact definition of postbiotics is yet to be accepted as functional food with clinical and non-clinical benefits. Postbiotics can be produced naturally from probiotics species most commonly from Lactobacillus species. Various laboratory methods like radiations (UV/ionizing), high pressure, high temperature, sonication and inactivation by formalin, can also be used to produce postbiotics. Postbiotics are less challenging than probiotics in terms of preparation, long shelf life as they do

not require cold chains, precise action, etc. but their use is still in the nascent stage.
The paper highlights the main postbiotic components, such as inactivated and dead probiotics, microbial cells, metabolites, CFS, EPS, and their antimicrobial, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties with favorable physiological, immunological, neuro-hormonal, biological, regulatory and metabolic reactions.
There are many health and nutritional benefits of postbiotics which can treat a range of diseases and improve the general health status. Postbiotics have many non-clinical applications. They are able to increase food shelf life using an active packaging approach. These have cosmetic applications to reduce inflammation and acne. As positive biological responses to postbiotics have been observed in animal models & cell cultures, more human clinical trials are needed to assess their safety profile. A novel emerging area of postbiotic application is biological doping to study and enhance the physical performance of organisms.
In conclusion, postbiotics can be beneficial for the host's health even though the exact mechanisms are still under

research. Advanced research on the biological response of the metabolites and host postbiotic interactions using different omic approaches can reveal more applications of postbiotics in the clinical as well as non-clinical sector.

ABSTRACT
Background: The circadian clock regulates the function of the immune system, the replication of viruses, and the magnitude of infections. The aim of this study was to analyse whether hospital attendance in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients presents a diurnal variation. Methods: Data from the electronic medical records of 1094 COVID-19 patients who presented to a Health Centre in Qatar during the month of July 2020 was retrospectively analysed. The following demographic (i.e. time of day (TOD), sex, age), clinical (i.e. cycle threshold (CT), temperature, oxy-haemoglobin saturation and resting heart-rate), biochemical (i.e. uraemia, glycaemia and albuminia) and haematological (i.e. leukocytes, erythrocytes ad platelets) parameters were collected. Results: Univariate analysis showed a significant effect of TOD on hospital admission (p < 0.001), with patients attending the health care centre more during the active behavioural phase (08h00-00h00) compared to the resting phase (00h00-08h00). COVID-19 infection blunted the circadian rhythms of core body temperature, neutrophils and leukocytes family and shifted the circadian rhythms of resting heart-rate and uraemia. Correlation analysis showed a near perfect negative correlation between the age of patients and the TOD (r¼-0.97), with older patients attending the care centre earlier during the day. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection affected the circadian rhythms of the host through disrupting the circadian rhythms of core temperature and innate immunity mediators. Old patients attend the health care centre earlier compared to younger ones. However, CT during polymerase chain reaction-test was unaffected by the TOD, which limits the conclusion that COVID-19 viral infection exhibits diurnal variation.

Introduction
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been declared a public health epidemic of global outrage by the World Health Organisation (WHO), is among the most shocking diseases in recent years [1]. There were nearly 620 M laboratory reported cases and over 6.5 M deaths worldwide as of 26 September 2022 (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Even though COVID-19 can affect people of all ages, older people are at a higher risk of deleterious consequences, as well as a greater fatality rate [2,3]. For instance, in a cohort of 8516 American veterans, hospital

admission during the high load period of intensive care units was associated with two-fold mortality compared to patients treated during the low load period [4]. Understanding the origins of this temporal distribution will increase the efficiency of health care intervention [1]. However, little is known about the circadian distribution of COVID-19 patient admissions.
Almost all physiological and behavioural functions fluctuate over the 24-h cycle. This cycle, namely the circadian rhythm, is generated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus and coordinated by the peripheral circadian clock located in distal tissue by

way of hormones, clock genes and body temperature [5,6]. Circadian rhythmicity is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that serves to adapt the organism to the 24-h environmental day [7,8]. Because the exposition of the host to pathogens varies across the 24-h cycle, the circadian clock anticipates environmental daily changes in order to optimize the immune response [8-10]. Several types of illness exhibit diurnal variation [11,12]. For instance, respiratory diseases (viral and allergic rhinorrhoea, nocturnal asthma, and chronic pulmonary obstructive disease) display circadian variation with symptoms and/or gravity requiring hospital attendance occurring during the night [11]. Consequently, mediators of the immune system have been shown to exhibit diurnal variations in the blood and tissues, including immune cells, antibodies, cytokines, chemokines and hormones [10]. During the active phase, immune cells migrate to the peripheral tissues in a major anti-microbial response, and the circulating number of immune cells increases during the night [13].
Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 seem to be comparable, with some differences, to influenza [14]. As previous research confirmed that influenza infections and the severity of symptoms are affected by the time of the day (TOD) [11], it seems prudent to study the effect of TOD on COVID-19 patient hospital attendance. Importantly, a recent study reported a diurnal variation in the positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test, with a peak around 14h00 [15]. It has been consistently reported that circadian rhythm regulation differs between males and females [16], with females displaying smaller diurnal amplitude of temperature [17] and higher diurnal amplitude of melatonin [7] compared to males. Further, males and females sleep differently [18] and respond differently to sleep deprivation [17-19]. Indeed, the COVID-19 and its associated lockdown affected the sleep-wake cycle [20-22], with female being more disrupted than males [23-25]. However, little is known concerning the existence of a sex-based time course of COVID-19 patients' hospital attendance. Both physiological sleep and endogenous melatonin secretion, which present sex-based differences, play an important role in innate immunity regulation [26,27]. The observation that COVID-19 patients reported highly disturbed sleep-wake cycles [24] may be indicative of an infection-based circadian disruption. In addition, older people show reduced circadian flexibility and could be more affected when facing a circadian disrupter [16].

Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the diurnal distribution of hospital attendance in COVID-19 positive patients. The second aim was to study the sex and age differences in COVID-19 positive patients attending hospital. Based on the existing literature, it was hypothesized that the COVID-19 could also exhibit diurnal variation in hospital attendance, which may be affected by sex and age.
Patients and methods
Study design
In this study, we retrospectively analysed data from the electronic medical records of 1049 COVID-19 positive patients who had presented to Rawdat Al Khail Health Centre, Doha, Qatar (RAK-HC) during the period between 1 July and 31 July 2020. This study was approved by the institutional review board at Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC-Ref No. PHCC/DCR/ 2020/08/091) in the spirit of the Helsinki Declaration (64th World Medical Association General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013). All respondents provided written consent for anonymous data use for research purposes and publications. The data was handled in an anonymous way and in line with the `General Data Protection Regulation' (gdpr-info.eu).
Patient population and data collection
This retrospective observational study included all COVID-19 positive patients who presented to RAK-HC during the month of July 2020. The parameters looked at were time of registration of the patients, when they presented to RAK-HC for COVID-19 testing, and demographic data (i.e. age and sex) of patients. Patients presenting to RAK-HC with symptoms of probable COVID-19 underwent oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs by trained healthcare professionals to test for SARS-Cov-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing at the laboratory in Hamad Hospital, which is the government designated testing laboratory in Qatar. Only COVID-19 positive patients were included in this study.
Demographic (i.e. TOD, age and sex), clinical [i.e. cycle threshold (CT), core body temperature, resting heart-rate and oxy-haemoglobin saturation (SpO2)], biochemical (i.e. albumin, plasma glucose and urea) and haematological (i.e. erythrocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils and platelets) data were collected from the electronic medical records after all patient identifiable data being removed as per the research study requirements.

Statistical analysis
The statistical tests were processed in GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The quantitative data was expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Comparison between different TOD [six time frames (00h00-04h00; 04h00-08h00; 08h00-12h00; 12h00-16h00; 16h00-20h00 and 20h00-00h00)] was assessed by a One way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Sex-based comparison at different TOD was assessed by a Two way ANOVA [six time frames (00h00-04h00; 04h00-08h00; 08h00-12h00; 12h00-16h00; 16h0020h00 and 20h00-00h00) Ã sex (male/female)]. Once the ANOVA indicates a significant effect or interaction, a Bonferroni post-hoc test was performed to compare data by pair. Pearson product-moment correlation `Pearson r' was performed between the selected demographic, clinical, biochemical and haematological parameters. `Pearson r' was considered `high' when it was > 0.70, `good' when it was between 0.50 and 0.70, `fair' if it was between 0.30 and 0.50 and `weak or no association' if it was < 0.30 [28]. The accepted level of significance was p < 0.05.
Results
Participants
The overall sample included 1094 patients. However, since data were acquired under crisis conditions, some were missing, and not all the patients have complete files. Figure 1 shows the number of participants and missing data for each parameter.

Figure 1. Number of participants, and missing data for each parameter. N: number of valid files; M: males; and F: females.
Multivariate analysis
The power analysis for multivariate analysis was a posteriori calculated and showed a strong observed power of 0.96. Male patients showed higher erythrocytes and uraemia compared to females (all; p < 0.05), and females showed higher SpO2 compared to males (all; p < 0.05) at different TODs. Mean and SD of different clinical, haematological, and biochemical data according to TOD and sex are presented in Figure 3.

Univariate analysis
The power analysis for univariate analysis was a posteriori calculated and showed an observed power of 1. The number of COVID-19 patients attending the health care centre was higher between 08h00 and 00h00 compared to 00h00 and 08h00 (all p < 0.001) with no difference between sexes (Figure 2). CT, core body temperature, leukocytes and neutrophils were not affected by the TOD (Table 1). However, resting heart-rate and SpO2 were lower between 00h00-04h00 and heart-rate was higher at 20h00-00h00 compared to other TODs. Erythrocytes (at; 08h00-12h00) and platelets (at; 12h00-16h00) count were higher compared to other TODs. In addition, uraemia and glycaemia levels were higher between 00h00 and 04h00 compared to other TODs. Table 1 summed the univariate effects of TOD on the selected clinical, haematological, and biochemical data.

Correlation analysis
The power analysis for the correlation analysis was a posteriori calculated and showed an observed power of 0.92. The correlation was performed on 274 complete files. There was a near perfect reverse correlation between the age of patients and TOD of hospital admission (r¼-0.97; p < 0.001). Pearson `r' matrix is presented in Table 2.
Discussion
The main outcome of this study was that hospital attendance in COVID-19 patients displays a diurnal variation, with patients attending hospital most in the active behavioural phase (between 08h00 and 00h00) compared to resting behavioural phase of the day (00h00-08h00). A strong negative correlation was found between the age of patients and the TOD of

hospital attendance, with older patients attending the hospital earlier during the day (00h00-04h00). However, the TOD of hospital attendance was not affected by the sex of patients. In addition, COVID-19 infection upregulated the circadian rhythms of several haematological, clinical and biochemical parameters.
The current results showed that COVID-19 patients attend the hospital most during the active phase (08h00-00h00) compared to the resting phase (00h0008h00). A recent study reported that SARS-CoV-2 positive tests were TOD dependent with a peak around

14h00 [15]. Although the former study reported on $86,000 patients from 130 different clinical locations and over 20 weeks, the reported TOD pattern showed similar trends as the current study. Therefore, the current findings validate the assumptions reported by McNaughton et al. [15]. In the same way, diurnal variation in the severity of local and systemic symptoms of common cold and influenza has been reported to be greater in the early morning [29]. Similarly, cough frequency in rhinorrhoea patients is more prominent during the initial hours after awakening from

nocturnal sleep [12]. This could be consequent to symptoms aggravation during the previous night. It was reported that asthma is more severe during the night time [29], probably because of the infectioninduced disruption in innate immunity [30]. It is well known that innate and adaptive immunities are under tight circadian control, with circulation peak occurring during the early night [30-34]. However, the current results showed that the circadian rhythms of neutrophils and leukocytes families were blunted in COVID19 positive patients attending the hospital. In cases of viral infection, clock gene expression is disturbed due to systemic inflammation [35,36]. The proinflammatory cytokine interferon is released chronically during viral infection, which has the ability to interfere with circadian regulation [37]. This could indicate that SARSCov-2 infection affected clock gene expression, namely the brain and muscle ARNT-like 1, which dampened the diurnal variation of immune cells activities [36]. A near perfect reverse correlation (r ¼ À97) was found between age and TOD in hospital attendance, with older patients attending the health care centre earlier during the day compared to younger patients. For instance, morningness preference (shift of rest/activity rhythm to the morning) is associated with advanced age [16,38], which could explain why older patients attend the health care centre at an earlier TOD compared to younger patients. Also, ageing is the most significant risk factor for developing severe outcomes and fatality in COVID-19 patients [2]. Indeed, developing severe COVID-19 outcomes could be related to the age-related immunosenescence [2], which could be defined as a chronic, low grade activation of proinflammatory process within the aged-organism [16]. The current data showed that oldest patients attended the care centre between 00h00 and 04h00. This could be explained by the increased asthma symptoms during the night [29] and the age-related decrease in physiological reserve in the respiratory system [2] that has aggravated COVID-19 symptoms, requiring immediate hospital attendance in older patients.
The current results showed that the CT (i.e. viral load) was unaffected by the TOD. Therefore, the assumption that COVID-19 hospital attendance is affected by the TOD could be somehow misleading. Contrarily, a recent study showed that the viral load was lower during the day in SARS-CoV-2 patients [15]. In fact, only female patients showed a trend towards lower CT values between 16h00 and 20h00, but this difference was not significant. These conflicting results might be explained by the sample size, which is larger from different locations and with a longer collection

period in the above mentioned study [15]. Indeed, further research on larger sample size and different cohorts is required to confirm, or deny, the current results.
It has consistently been reported that core body temperature displays a strong circadian rhythmicity [39,40], which was blunted in the current study by COVID-19 infection. This could be explained by the infection-induced fever, which is associated with improved survival and resolution of infection [41]. In addition, COVID-19 infection shifted the circadian rhythms of resting heart-rate. Physiological resting heart-rate is higher during the morning [40,42] but in the current study, heart-rate was higher during the night (20h00-00h00) compared to the other TODs. Indeed, weak but highly significant correlations were found between CT on the one hand, and core body temperature and heart-rate on the other hand. In addition, SARS-Cov-2 infection shifted the circadian rhythms of uraemia, which was higher 00h00-04h00 compared to all other TODs. Contrarily, physiological uraemia was reported to be lower at this TOD (00h0004h00) and higher between 08h00-14h00 [40]. The current finding showed that the circadian rhythm of glycaemia was upregulated by the COVID-19 infection only in female patients. Physiological glycaemia is higher during the beginning of the active phase of the day [43], which was true only for male patients in the current study (i.e. higher glycaemia between 08h00 and 12h00). However, glycaemia was higher between 00h00 and 04h00 in female patients. Although the origin of this upregulation is not clear, it could be associated with the inflammation-induced fever. Actually, it has been reported that a 1 C increase in core body temperature requires a 10%-12% increase in metabolic rate [41]. Taken together, these findings strengthen the fact that the SARS-Cov-2 infection disrupted circadian rhythms regulation, probably via circadian gene expression channels [36,44]. Contrary to the strong relationship between the time of hospital attendance and the age of the patient, the TOD of hospital attendance was not related to the sex of the patients. Actually, the sex-based difference in SpO2 persisted in the current study, with females showing higher SpO2 compared to males, similarly to earlier reports [45]. Moreover, males showed higher erythrocytes level compared to females at different TODs, similarly to physiological haematocrit concentration reported elsewhere [46]. This could be indicative of a negligible effect of sex in regard to SARS-Cov-2 infection.

The current findings could be of relevance in the understanding of the temporal pattern of the COVID19 pandemic. Patients attend health care centres at different TOD and for various reasons. Whether the presentation at a particular TOD has an effect on their overall outcome during the disease process is a key question. Identifying such times will help clinicians to prioritize, escalate, and manage such patients appropriately so that they receive the best possible outcome for their condition. Also, adjusting staffing numbers in health centres when more patients are present could be helpful in dealing more effectively as well as help improve efficiency whilst dealing with the challenges of this pandemic.
To the authors' finest knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the diurnal variations in symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Diurnal variation in symptoms of cold and influenza has been reported in the literature [11]. Although the current results showed that COVID-19 patients' hospital admission is influenced by the TOD, the findings do not conclusively support that COVID-19 symptoms follow the same circadian pattern. First, the CT was not influenced by the TOD. Second, the time of viral infection may have affected the time of clinical presentation in these patients [11], which is beyond the scope of this study. Besides, the relatively long incubation period of SARSCoV-2 makes it difficult to identify retrospectively the onset time of infection. Indeed, the causal relationship between TOD and COVID-19 remains unclear and still to be explored. Furthermore, a longitudinal follow up of patients' vitals and the development of their symptoms would be very helpful to a better understanding of this pandemic. No exclusion criteria were applied in the current study, which could limit the current assumptions. In addition, there was no control group (e.g. patient attending the healthcare centre for other reasons) in the current study. Indeed, the lack of comparison could lead to biased conclusions. Thus, further studies on larger scales could generate a better understanding of the relationship.

Conclusion
COVID-19 patients' attendance at the health care centre was found to be associated with the rest/activity pattern. However, the CT was unaffected by the TOD, which limits the conclusion that COVID-19 symptoms' gravity is modulated by the TOD. Older patients attend the health care centre earlier during the day compared to younger patients. Furthermore, COVID-19 dampened the circadian variation in core body temperature,

USE OF 5A-REDUCTASE INHIBITORS IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER RISK OF INFECTION WITH SARS-COV-2
Madison Lyon*, Jianbo Li, Alex Milinovich, Nima Sharifi, Eric A. Klein, Cleveland, OH
INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The TMPRSS protein serves as a host co-receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 and is present in both prostate and lung tissue. This protein is known to be androgen regulated in the prostate, however, there is conflicting data on whether it is also androgen regulated in the lung, an important site for COVID-19 infection. Two randomized controlled trials have shown 5a-reductase inhibitors (5aRI) reduced the severity of COVID-19 symptoms in infected men, and reduced the likelihood of hospitalization. In the present study, we assessed the effect of 5aRI use on risk of community acquired COVID-19 infection.
METHODS: All men without prostate cancer included in an institutional prospective registry of all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 8, 2020 and February 15, 2021 were included. Patients in the 5ARI cohort were matched at a 1:1 ratio to those not on 5ARI based on demographics and comorbidities that are known to increase the risk of infection. Exact matching was performed on race, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and immune suppressive disease. The main outcome measures were the effect of 5aRI use on the rate of SARS-Cov-2 positivity and disease severity as measured by hospitalization, ICU admission, and death.
RESULTS: 60,474 males without prostate cancer diagnosis were initially selected, of which 1,079 were on 5ARI (1.8%). The matched cohorts included 1,075 on 5ARI and 1,075 non-5ARI, aged 21 to 99 years (Fig. 1). Of all the demographics and risk factors none were significantly different between the 5ARI groups in the matched cohorts. Risk for SARS-CoV-2 was significantly lower in the 5ARI group (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.97, p[0.024, Table). Multivariable logistic regression analysis based on the entire data before matching reached the same conclusion.
CONCLUSIONS: Men without prostate cancer taking a 5aRI are at lower risk for community acquired COVID-19 infection.

LOWER URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS AND UTILIZATION OF BLADDER OUTLET PROCEDURES IN PATIENTS WITH PROSTATE CANCER ON ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE
Da David Jiang*, Boston, MA; Jeannette Schenk, Seattle, WA; Nicholas Chakiryan, Tampa, FL; Kyle Gillis, Iowa City, IA; Meghan Liu, Lisa Newcomb, Yingye Zheng, Daniel Lin, Seattle, WA; Peter Chang, Andrew Wagner, Boston, MA
INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer (PCa) patients on active surveillance (AS) may have concurrent lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). Few studies have addressed LUTS in this population and guidelines are lacking on the management of LUTS for patients with PCa. The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of LUTS and rates of treatment among men with PCa on AS.
METHODS: Data are from the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study (PASS), a multicenter prospective cohort of men with PCa on AS. At enrollment and every 6 months thereafter data on medications and procedures for BPE were abstracted from medical records and assessments of LUTS via AUA symptom Score (AUASS) were completed. Men completed the enrollment and !1 post-enrollment AUASS and had a minimum of one year follow-up. Men who underwent bladder outlet procedures prior to enrollment or those with prostatitis at any follow-up visit were excluded. LUTS at enrollment were categorized as mild (AUASS 0-7), moderate (8-19) or severe (20-35). Rates of BPE treatments as well as PCa treatment were compared using univariable analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 1501 men were included in the study with a median follow-up of 6.4 (IQR 3.2,9.1) years. The median AUASS at enrollment was 7 (IQR 3,11). At enrollment, the prevalence of severe LUTS was 95 (6%), and 283 (19%) were receiving medical treatment for LUTS. A total of 22 (1.4%) men underwent BPE procedure during the study. Compared to men with mild LUTS, men with moderate or severe LUTS were more likely to receive BPE treatments; however even among patients with severe LUTS, only 4.2% underwent bladder outlet procedures. Men with worse LUTS were more likely to have more indolent prostate cancer (Gleason Grade group 1, p[0.03); and were less likely to undergo definitive treatment for PCa (p <0.01). Among men with severe LUTS that received definitive PCa treatment, the majority underwent radical prostatectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PCa on AS with severe LUTS were more likely to harbor indolent PCa and had a low treatment rate for PCa. Although those with severe LUTS were more likely to receive bladder outlet procedures, only 4% of those patients actually did. Additional efforts are necessary to evaluate treatment paradigms for BPE in AS patients.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Effective therapy to reduce risk of RCC relapse after surgery remains an unmet need. Adjuvant immune therapy is a potential strategy for these pts. The KEYNOTE-564 trial (NCT03142334) evaluated pembro vs placebo as adjuvant therapy for pts with RCC.
METHODS: KEYNOTE-564 is a phase 3 trial of pembro vs placebo for 17 cycles (z1 yr) in pts with histologically confirmed clear cell RCC, with pT2, Gr 4 or sarcomatoid, N0 M0; pT3 or pT4, any Gr, N0 M0; any pT, any Gr, NþM0; or M1 NED (no evidence of disease after primary tumor þ soft tissue metastases completely resected 1 yr from nephrectomy). Pts had undergone surgery 12 wks prior to randomization; had no prior systemic therapy; had ECOG PS 0 or 1. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS) per investigator assessment in all randomized pts (ITT population). Overall survival (OS) was a key secondary endpoint. Safety in all treated pts was a secondary endpoint.
RESULTS: 994 pts were randomized 1:1 to pembro (n[496) or placebo (n[498). Median (range) time from randomization to data cutoff date of Dec 14, 2020 was 24.1 (14.9À41.5) mo. No pts remained on study treatment. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between arms. At first prespecified interim analysis, the primary endpoint of DFS was met (median not reached [NR] for both arms, HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53À0.87; p[0.0010 [one-sided]). Estimated DFS rate at 24 mo was 77.3% with pembro vs 68.1% with placebo. Overall, DFS benefit was consistent across subgroups. 51 OS events were observed (18 in the pembro arm, 33 in the placebo arm). Median OS was NR for both arms (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30À0.96; p[0.0164 [onesided]); the p-value did not cross the statistical hypothesis testing boundary. Estimated OS rate at 24 mo was 96.6% with pembro vs 93.5% with placebo. 470 pts (96.3%) and 452 pts (91.1%) experienced !1 all-cause adverse events (AEs) with pembro vs placebo, respectively. Grade 3-5 all-cause AEs occurred in 158 pts (32.4%) with pembro and 88 pts (17.7%) with placebo. No deaths related to pembro occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Pembro demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in DFS vs placebo in pts

A NOVEL SUBLINGUAL VACCINE WILL DRAMATICALLY ALTER THE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF RECURRENT URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS IN WOMEN
J. Curtis Nickel*, Kingston, Canada; María Fernanda Lorenzo-Gomez, Salamanca, Spain; Stephen Foley, Reading, United Kingdom; Paula Saz-Leal, Madrid, Spain
INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) managed with antibiotics, suffer morbidity, while society is burdened with significant costs and the rising specter of antibiotic resistance. We report a game-changing vaccine, MV140, for the prevention of rUTI in women.
METHODS: The novel mechanism of action of MV140 is examined. Results from 1. early uncontrolled studies, 2. the first phase III multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT (randomized women with rUTI to 6 months placebo or MV140 for 3 or 6 months with 12 months total follow-up), 3. ongoing safety monitoring from special access programs (SAP; 2014-2020) and 4. the first in North America (NA) clinical experience evaluating the novel sublingual vaccine MV140 (Uromune) for prevention of rUTI in women are reported. Major endpoints for the reported clinical studies were number of UTIs, UTI-free rate and safety following 3 months vaccine administration.
RESULTS: Stimulation of sublingual mucosa with MV140 (Uromune), a polybacterial sublingual vaccine consisting of whole inactivated bacteria (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, P. vulgaris) induces induction of a T-cell specific adaptive as well as innate immune response at the level of the genitourinary tract. In 5 uncontrolled studies 1,408 women treated with MV140 had significantly higher UTI-free rates (35 to 90%) than 499 women treated with antibiotic prophylaxis (0-9%). In the pivotal RCT (240 women randomized), the median number of UTI episodes for 9 months post-vaccination was 3.0 [IQR, 0.5-6.0] in placebo compared to 0.0 [IQR, 0.0-1.0] in both groups receiving MV140 (p <0.001). UTI-free rates of 55.7% and 58.0% were observed in subjects receiving MV140 for 3 or 6 months, respectively compared to 25.0% in placebo group (p <0.001). Only 5 (2 with placebo; 3 with MV140) subjects reported non-serious adverse reactions (A/R). The ongoing SAP safety study documented A/R's in 1.7% of over 20,500 patients. Subjects enrolled in the NA study prior to pre-Covid-19 mandatory recruitment shutdown (n[25) experienced a 48% UTI-free rate (with overall 82% reduction in UTI episodes compared to pre-vaccination) in the 9 months following 3 month vaccination period with one subject having 2 mild vaccine associated A/Rs.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical studies confirm the theoretical benefits of MV140 vaccine as a safe and effective strategy to reduce the incidence and/or prevent rUTI in women. Physicians who treat rUTI and women who suffer from rUTI will soon have an evidence-based alternative to antibiotic management.

SARS-CoV-2 and EBV; the cost of a second mitochondrial "whammy"?
Alistair V.W. Nunn1*, Geoffrey W. Guy2, Stanley W. Botchway3 and Jimmy D. Bell1

Abstract
We, and others, have suggested that as the SARS-CoV-2 virus may modulate mitochondrial function, good mitochondrial reserve and health could be key in determining disease severity when exposed to this virus, as the immune system itself is dependent on this organelle's function. With the recent publication of a paper showing that long COVID could be associated with the reactivation of the Epstein Barr Virus, which is well known to manipulate mitochondria, we suggest that this could represent a second mitochondrial "whammy" that might support the mitochondrial hypothesis underlying COVID-19 severity and potentially, the occurrence of longer-term symptoms. As mitochondrial function declines with age, this could be an important factor in why older populations are more susceptible. Key factors which ensure optimal mitochondrial health are generally those that ensure healthy ageing, such as a good lifestyle with plenty of physical activity. The ability of viruses to manipulate mitochondrial function is well described, and it is now also thought that for evolutionary reasons, they also manipulate the ageing process. Given that slowing the ageing process could well be linked to better economic outcomes, the link between mitochondrial health, economics, COVID-19 and other viruses, as well as lifestyle, needs to be considered.

Background As mitochondria are key in the immune response [1], we have previously suggested that as SARS-CoV-2 may modulate mitochondrial function it may have a greater adverse effect in those with poorer mitochondrial health, such as the elderly and those displaying evidence of the metabolic syndrome [2]. We are not alone in this thinking [3-5], which is why it has been suggested that high aerobic fitness could be beneficial [6]. In fact, data continue to support a role for mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic perturbation in the pathogenesis of this condition [7, 8] - including coincident hyperglycaemia that seems to be associated with more severe disease [9].

In short, good mitochondrial health and reserve could well be important components in the resistance to SARS-CoV-2. Although there is building evidence for this [10], the idea is still not yet mainstream.
However, it now seems that "long COVID" could also be related to reactivation of the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), which lies dormant in a very high percentage of the population [11]. For instance, there is a correlation with impaired lymphocyte subpopulation count, EBV load and severity of disease [12], as well as evidence that EBV can induce angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression and SARS-CoV-2 entry to epithelial cells [13]. Critically, given that more than half of survivors of COVID-19 appear to have long term symptoms (post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 [PASC]) or "longCOVID" [14], the described association of EBV with mitochondrial dysfunction [15] could play a key role in

susceptibility and recovery from SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the recent discovery that mitochondrial function is essential for sustained killing by cytotoxic T cells, for instance, of virally infected cells [16], is perhaps also suggestive, as EBV can also infect T cells [17]. In this regard, it is perhaps relevant that in people with SARSCOV-2 a subset of T cells with an altered metabolic profile, which are prone to mitochondrial apoptosis and resultant lymphopenia, as well as enhanced numbers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, are associated with disease severity and altered voltage dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) expression - a pivotal mitochondrial protein [18].
In effect, EBV could tip an already compromised system into a self-perpetuating metabolic-oxidative stressinflammatory spiral that could underly many of the symptoms of long COVID. The likelihood of this happening could be increased in people who already have sub-optimal mitochondrial function associated with a sedentary lifestyle. In this regard, a genetic and phenotypic analysis of the causal relationship between ageing and COVID-19 seems to indicate that accelerated biological ageing is a key factor in susceptibility risk, with both altered Notch signalling and B cell functioning being important [19].
EBV modulates mitochondria - a second whammy? The association between EBV-induced chronic fatigue syndrome with mitochondrial dysfunction was suggested many years ago [15]. EBV can alter mitochondrial dynamics and DNA replication [20, 21], as well as interact with latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and dynaminrelated protein 1 (Drp1), enhancing glycolysis [22]. It can also induce metabolic reprogramming in monocytes, which is associated with decreased autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. This enhances apoptosis and reduces immune surveillance [23]. EBV also modulates c-Myc activity and glutaminolysis and thus aerobic glycolysis and enhances the activity of glutaminase-1 (GLS-1) isoforms in mitochondria, which explains its association with cancer [24]. This therefore raises the possibility that reactivation of the EBV serves as a second mitochondrial "whammy", leading to a sustained inflammatory response and the classical symptoms of brain fog, tiredness and weakness. This has many similarities to cytokine induced sickness behaviour associated with other conditions, such as cancer, cancer treatment, multiple sclerosis, as well as virally-induced fatigue syndrome, where mitochondrial dysfunction could also play a role [25]. The key here is that dysfunctional mitochondria can be a source of oxidative stress, which in turn, further compromises mitochondrial recovery due to feedback and their role in inflammatory signalling [26]. It is thus possible that even if the cause of the first

whammy, the corona virus, is cleared, this imbalance can continue for some time; the second EBV whammy, whether coincident, or caused by reactivation due to reduced immune function, would only make this worse.
Mitochondria are more than just "powerhouses" of the cell At the most basic level the mitochondrion must balance metabolic priorities between energy production, growth, defence and the management of oxidative stress. The key to understanding this is that mitochondria are not just "powerhouses", but also sense the cellular environment, control growth, inflammation, senescence and death. Having a good mitochondrial reserve enables the cell to be flexible and multi-task, whether it is in a neuron or an immune cell; loss of this flexibility certainly plays a role in ageing-related immunosenescence and the concept of "inflammaging" [27]. This is why physical activity is generally viewed as being a very good medicine, as all mitochondria in the body communicate with each other via myokines; the stress of exercise doesn't just induce an adaption in muscle, but in all other bodily systems and improves overall robustness [28]. This perhaps reflects our evolutionary heritage where movement was normal and became canalised as a necessary factor to maintain fitness in a calorie restricted environment; not moving and eating too much thus takes humans outside our evolutionary "flight envelope" [29].
Long COVID is not just a sequalae of the very ill It may well be relevant that pathogens such as viruses appear to manipulate the ageing process for their own evolutionary benefits, which could be viewed as an extension of the disposable soma theory of ageing [30]. This might suggest that even in people who do not exhibit particularly severe symptoms with the initial SARSCoV-2 infection, reactivation of EBV, or other viruses, could trigger a secondary longer-term syndrome if their mitochondrial reserve is low. In terms of prevention and treatment, not only would this continue to support physical activity as being key, but also diets high in plant defence compounds with pleiotropic actions that are known to modulate mitochondrial function, induce resolution of inflammation, as well as displaying antipathogen function. This concept could also extend to existing drugs that also have pleiotropic actions involving modulation of mitochondrial function, such as metformin or steroids. It might also hint that mild calorie restriction, which can enhance mitochondrial function and reduce inflammation, could also play a role [2]. It has also been suggested a ketogenic diet might help, as mitochondria are key in the metabolic adaptation [31].

Viral reactivation might also indicate why there is some variability in response to treatment, as it is possible that each patient could have a mix of reactivated viruses, or other pathogens that complicate interpretation of efficacy as their bodies try to balance the multiple functions of mitochondria. A case in point is the potential for gut microbiota to affect how apparently healthy subjects respond to COVID-19 [32] and that there is cross-talk between gut microbiota and mitochondria, for instance, after exercise [33]. In short, having a healthy mitochondrial system could prevent a "domino" effect leading to a tipping point into a chronic inflammatory state, and if already infected, mitochondrial support and protection may provide a means to break the cycle. It therefore continues to suggest that not getting the virus in the first place, or being vaccinated, are key strategies. Indeed, a study in Switzerland suggested that 34.8 % of participants in an outpatient setting had post-acute symptoms seven months after diagnosis of COVID-19 [34].
Conclusions - the cost of mitochondrial ill-health As is fairly well established, a poor lifestyle accelerates the ageing process leading to morbidity expansion [29], which reduces the capacity of an individual to work and increases the load on society [35]. Add to this that viruses may also influence the ageing process [30], then a poor lifestyle coupled with increased viral load is going to further accelerate ageing across society and negatively affect the economy. Indeed a recent analysis suggests that slowing ageing across society could be, by far, the most sensible thing to do economically [36]. Given the well described link between mitochondrial function and ageing, especially of the immune system [37], then it could be argued there is also one between economics and mitochondrial health. Hence, the paper by Gold et al.[11] hints at another very important angle that governments, and healthcare providers, may need to consider: overloading ill-prepared mitochondria could cost money - and this overload could come in the guise of other viruses.

Abstract Background: Studies of anti-­SARS-­CoV-­2 humoral and adaptive response in COVID-­19 non-­vaccinated pediatric convalescents are controversial and further evidence from the pediatric population are needed. Objectives: To elucidate SARS-­CoV-­2 humoral and memory B-­ and T-­cells responses in pediatric convalescents as compared with the adult. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 80 non-­vaccinated, IgG-­positive, COVID-­19 convalescents (age 8.0-­61.0years), 4.0 months from onset. Frequency of responders and magnitudes of SARS-­COV-­2 IgG, memory B-­cells (MBC) and IFNg-­  and IL2-­secreting memory T-­cells (MTC) in response to immuno-­dominant peptide pools in pediatric, young adults and middle-­aged adults with onset age 8-­18years (N = 20), 19-­39years (N = 30) and 40-­61years (N = 30), respectively, were analyzed. SARS-­CoV-­2 IgG were detected by ELISA (Euroimmun, Germany). MBC, IFNg-­, IL2-­  and IFNg+IL2-­secreting MTC (IFNg-­MTC, IL2-­MTC and IFNg+IL2-­MTC) were detected using FluoroSpot (Mabtech, Sweden). Results: MBC level was lower in pediatric as compared with the middle-­aged adults (median 12.75 interquartile range [IQR] 4.27-­33.7 and 32.0 IQR 6.0-­124.2, respectively, p = .003). MBC level in young adults was lower than in middle-­aged adults (median 18.5 IQR 1.7-­43.8 and 32.0 IQR 6.0-­124.2, respectively, p = .006). The level of IL2-­MTC was lower in the pediatric group as compared with middle aged-­adults (median 2.1 IQR 0-­16.9 and 28.6 IQR 11-­49.6, respectively, p<.03) and in young adults lower than in middle-­aged adults (median 1.45 IQR 0-­18.6 and 28.6 IQR 11-­49.6, respectively, p = .02). In addition, the level of IFNg-­MTC was lower in pediatric as compared with young adults (median 4.25 IQR 0.0-­15.0 and 20.9 IQR 0-­75.2, respectively, p = .05). The level of IgG was comparable between pediatric and both young and middle-­aged adult groups (4.82±2.95, 3.70±2.65 and 4.9±2.94, respectively, p>.34).

1 | INTRODUCTION
Pediatric COVID-­19 is characterized by more frequent mild/asymptomatic disease than adults. Meta-­analysis of 50,000 COVID-­19 patients, estimated 27.7% of asymptomatic infections in pediatric as compared with 9.0% in older ages.1 Better capacity to control SARS-­CoV-­2 infection in pediatric population could be explained by efficient clearance of the virus, immunity to previous coronaviruses and age-­associated attributes of innate and adaptive immunity.2 Studies of humoral and adaptive memory T cells (MTC) responses in COVID-­19 pediatric convalescents are controversial. Previous studies demonstrated low magnitude3 and frequencies4 of SARS-­CoV-­ 2-­specific MTC in pediatric as compared with adult convalescents. In contrast, another study5 reported a 2-­fold higher magnitude and frequency of SARS-­CoV-­2-­specific IFNg-­secreting MTC in pediatric convalescents than in adults. The study by Rowntree et al.4 is the first to analyze memory B cells (MBC) in pediatric convalescents and report a low frequency of MBC as compared to adults. The understanding of COVID-­19 immunity in children is based mainly on immunological concepts evaluated in adults and empirically applied to the pediatric population and urges further evidence from the pediatric population. Elucidating SARS-­CoV-­2 MBC and MTC responses in pediatric convalescents are of paramount relevance from a clinical and public health perspective, mainly because it may allow us to assess re-­infection severity and the need to vaccinate children. Here, we compared SARS-­CoV-­2-­specific IgG levels, MBC and IFNg-­  and IL2-­secreting MTC in response to SARS-­CoV-­2S1 (Spike 1) and SNMO [Spike, Nucleoprotein, Membrane protein and Open reading frame (ORF-­3a and ORF-­7a)] peptide pools in pediatric and adult COVID-­19 convalescents. Indeed, our study is the first to simultaneously assess both frequencies and magnitude of SARS-­CoV-­2 specific IgG, MBC and MTC in pediatric convalescents.
2 | METHODS
2.1 | Participants
Non-­vaccinated SARS-­CoV-­2 positive, COVID-­19 convalescents were included. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) positive RT-­PCR SARS-­CoV-­2 at onset and (2) anti-­spike S1 IgG positive test at convalescence period. The disease symptomatology at onset was mild, with at least one of the following symptoms: fatigue, muscle pain, cough, or fever without hospitalization. Blood samples

Key Message Findings of anti-­SARS-­CoV-­2 humoral and adaptive responses in COVID-­19 pediatric convalescents are controversial and further evidences from pediatric population are needed. Our results demonstrated that COVID-­19 non-­ vaccinated pediatric convalescents have lower adaptive immune response than adults, sustaining the recommendation for vaccination of pediatric population.
were obtained at a median of 4.0 months after disease onset and applied for analysis of SARS-­CoV-­2 specific IgG, MBC and MTC. Samples were obtained between April to August 2020 during the first COVID-­19 outbreak of the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) in Israel. The pediatric convalescents with an age of COVID-­19 onset 8-­18years old were compared with a young adult-­onset patients with age 19-­ 39years and middle-­aged adult-­onset patients with age 40-­61years. Healthy subjects were enrolled to define cutoff levels for all tested parameters. Recruitment of healthy pediatric subjects was restricted by the incompliance of parents or guardians to sign informed consent. Therefore, relying on results published by Rowntree et al,4 that did not find the differences in frequency of SARS-­CoV-­2 specific memory T and B cells and anti-­receptor-­binding domain (RBD) IgG titers between healthy pediatric and adult subjects; in our study we use the healthy adult subjects as a control for both groups.
2.2 | Sample preparation
Whole blood samples were collected in serum and sodium heparin tubes (BD Vacutainer). Serum were stored at -20°C. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were purified from whole blood by Lymphoprep (STEMCELL Technologies) density gradient method and cryopreserved (10% dimethyl sulfoxide and 90% fetal calf serum) in liquid nitrogen until assayed at Neuroimmunology Laboratory of Sheba Medical Center.
2.3 | Detection of SARS-­CoV-­2 anti-­spike S1 IgG
Detection of SARS-­CoV-­2 IgG antibodies in serum was performed by immunoassay. Anti-­SARS-­CoV-­2 ELISA (IgG) kit (Euroimmun)

based on a recombinant S1 subunit of the SARS-­CoV-­2 spike protein was used. All procedures were performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions using the AGILITY® automated ELISA analyzer (DYNEX Technologies Inc.). For each sample, the ratio of an optical density to the reading of the calibrator was calculated (denoted as IgG Score). IgG Scores>1.0 were considered positive.
2.4 | Detection of anti-­SARS-­CoV-­2 MBC
Anti-­RBD-­specific MBC were detected in PBMCs by the ELISpot assay. PBMCs were cultured for 5days in RPMI-­1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-­streptomycin, ­supplemented with 1g/ml R848 (resiquimod; a TLR7/8 agonist) and 10ng/ml recombinant human IL-­2. After incubation cells were washed and a total of 250.000 PBMC per well were loaded onto ELISpot plates pre-­coated with monoclonal anti-­human IgG antibodies for 24h (37°C, 5% CO2). The human IgG SARS-­CoV-­2 RBD ELISpotPLUS (ALP kit, Mabtech, Sweden) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously.6 The number of MBC was measured as spot forming units (SFU) using a Mabtech IRISTM reader. The results were expressed as SFU per 250.000 PBMC. The positive cut-­off value (5.0 SFU/250.000 PBMC) was calculated as a 90% confidence interval in 16 adult healthy controls.
2.5 | Detection of anti-­SARS-­CoV-­2 MTC

non-­parametric ANOVA Kruskal-­Wallis test, the Mann-­Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test, and correlation was assessed by the Spearman test.
3 | RESULTS
Eighty IgG-­positive COVID-­19 convalescents, 30 females, mean±SD age 32.6±14.8years, range 8.0-­61.0years, were included in the study. Blood samples were obtained at a median 4.0 IQR 2.1-­ 5.5 months from COVID-­19 onset and 77 and 40 samples were tested for MBC and MTC, respectively (Figure 1). The average IgG Score was 4.43±2.86, 71.2% were positive for MBC and 87.1% were positive for at least one of IFNg-­, IL2-­ or IFNg+IL2-­MTC, 72.2% were positive for both MBC and MTC and 13.1% were negative for both MBC and MTC.
Subjects were divided into three groups: (a) pediatric (n = 20) with COVID-­19 onset between 8.0-­18years, mean±SD 13.7±3.0years, 8 females; (b) young adult (n = 30) with disease onset between 19 and 39years, mean±SD 29.2±7.3years, 12 females and (c) middle-­ aged adults group (n = 30) with COVID-­19 onset between 40 and 61years, mean±SD 48.4±4.7years, 10 females (Figure 1, Table 1). The median time from COVID-­19 onset to immunological tests was 3.79 IQR (2.0-­5.1), 3.91 IQR (1.6-­5.0) and 4.11 IQR (2.9-­6.3) months for the pediatric, young adult and middle-­aged adult groups, respectively. The differences in the time since COVID-­19 onset between young adult and middle-­aged adult groups as compared to the pediatric group were not significant (p = .74 and p = .33, respectively).

The IFNg-­, IL2-­  and IFNg+IL2-­secreting MTC (IFNg-­MTC, IL2-­ MTC and IFNg+IL2-­MTC) were detected in PBMC using human IFNg and IL2 SARS-­CoV-­2 FluoroSpotPLUS kits according to the manufacturer's protocol (Mabtech AB) as previously described.6 Results of FluoroSpot assays were evaluated using an IRIS-­reader (Mabtech AB) and expressed as SFU per 250.000 PBMC. SARS-­ CoV-­2 peptide pools S1 and SNMO (Mabtech, Sweden, product cod 3622-­1)--­responses were quantified by measuring IFNg-­, IL2-­  or IFN+IL2-­MTC. The overall IFNg-­, IL2-­  or IFNg+IL2-­MTC positive response, was calculated as at least one positive response for either IFNg, IL2 or IFNg+IL2 to S1 or SNMO. For overall MTC response to one of the cytokines, we have summarized the positive SFU of specific cytokine-­secreting MTC in response to S1 and SNMO. The positive cut-­off value (0.0 SFU) was calculated as a 90% confidence interval in the 16 adult healthy controls. The unstimulated PBMC were used for background correction and the polyclonal T cell activation by anti-­CD3 served as a positive control.

3.1 | The effect of age on humoral and cellular immune responses
Comparable levels of IgG between pediatric and both young and middle-­aged adult groups (4.82±2.95, 3.70±2.65 and 4.9±2.94, respectively, p>.34) were observed. In accordance, the frequency of MBC-­responders was not significantly different between pediatric, young adult and middle-­aged adult groups (75.0%, 70.0% and 76.7%, respectively). The frequency of responders by overall IFNg-­MTC

2.6 | Statistical analysis
All continuous characteristics are described as the mean±(SD), non-­ continuous characteristics are described as medians with a 25%-­ 75% interquartile range (IQR). Differences were determined by the

The level of SARS-­CoV-­2 specific anti-­spike IgG and the SFU magnitudes of MBC and IFNg-­, IL2-­ and IFNg+IL2-­ MTC were simultaneously evaluated at a median of 4.0 months after disease onset. SFU--­spot forming units, IgG--­anti-­SARS-­ CoV-­2 anti-­spike IgG Score; MBC--­memory B-­cells, MTC--­memory T-­cells, IFN-­MTC--­overall IFNg-­secreting MTC are calculated as the sum of the positive SFU in response to S1and SNMO peptides. IL2-­MTC--­overall IL2 secreting MTC are calculated as the sum of the positive SFU in response to S1 and SNMO peptides.

was lower in the pediatric group than in the middle-­aged adult group (62.5% and 100.0%, respectively, p = .05), but the responders by overall IL2-­ and IFNg+IL2-­MTC were not different.
The SFU level of MBC was significantly lower in the pediatric group as compared with the middle-­aged adults' group (median 12.75 IQR 4.27-­33.7 and 32.0 IQR 6.0-­124.2, respectively, p = .003). Similarly, the young adult group was characterized by lower SFU levels of MBC than the middle-­aged adults (median 18.5 IQR 1.7-­43.8 and 32.0 IQR 6.0-­124.2, respectively, p = .006; Figure 2). As regards MTC, the SFU levels of IL2-­MTC were lower in the pediatric group as compared to the middle-­aged adults group (median 2.1 IQR 0-­16.9 and 28.6 IQR 11-­49.6, respectively, p<.03) and also lower in the young adult group than in middle-­aged adults group (median 1.45 IQR 0-­18.6 and 28.6 IQR 11-­49.6, respectively, p = .02). In addition, the SFU level of IFNg-­MTC was lower in the pediatric group as compared to the young adult group (median 4.25

IQR 0.0-­15.0 and 20.9 IQR 0-­75.2, respectively p = .05; Figure 2). Age was correlated with SFU level of MBC (r = .34, p = .003), IL2-­ MTC (r = .44, p = .005) and IFNg+IL2-­MTC (r = 35, p = .03), while no significant correlation was observed between age and anti-­spike IgG level (Figure 3). Analysis of SARS-­CoV-­2 specific MTC repertoire in response to S1 and SNMO peptide pools demonstrated lower SFU level of IL2-­MTC in response to S1 in the pediatric group (median 0.0 IQR 0.0-­6.8) and lack of MTC in young adults group (median 0.0 IQR 0.0-­0.0) as compared with a middle-­aged adult group (median 10.3 IQR 0.0-­21.5, p<.05). Similarly, IL2-­MTC in response to SNMO in the pediatric group (median SFU 2.1, IQR 0.0-­7.0) and young adults group (median SFU 1.45, IQR 0.0-­13.4) were lower than in middle-­aged adult group (median SFU 10.4, IQR 2.9-­34.5, p<.05; Figure 4). We did not observe IFNg-­MTC in response to SNMO in the pediatric group (median 0.0, IQR 0.0-­0.0) and young adult group (median 0.0, IQR 0.0-­11.5) in contrast to the middle-­aged adult group (median 4.1, IQR 0.0-­21.0, p<.05). The SFU level of IFNg-­MTC in response to S1 was lower as compared with middle-­aged adults (median 0.0, IQR 0.0-0­ .0 and median 5.0, IQR 0.0-­6.9, p = .03).
4 | DISCUSSION
A growing body of evidence has been accumulated on the features of SARS-­CoV-­2-­specific adaptive immunity in convalescents,6-­12 however, these studies were mainly based on adults. Our study based on non-­vaccinated pediatric and adult cohorts indicate lower SFU magnitude of MBC and IL2-­MTC, frequency and magnitude of IFNg-­MTC in response to S1 and SNMO peptide pools in pediatric convalescents as compared with adults, while levels of IgG, frequency of MBC-­responders and IL2-­MTC-­ and IFNg+IL2-­ MTC--­responders remained comparable. Numerous studies analyzed anti-­SARS-­CoV-­2 specific humoral response and MBC and MTC adaptive immunity in pediatric convalescents.3-­5 To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to simultaneously characterize the level of anti-­spike specific IgG, frequencies and magnitudes of MBC and MTC in response to immuno-­dominant peptide pools in pediatric convalescents.
Our results partially resemble these of Weisberg et al,13 that did not find a significant correlation between anti-­SARS-­CoV-­2 IgG and age. Other studies by Rowntree et al and Yang et al4,14 corroborate our findings and demonstrate similar IgG levels between pediatric and adult convalescents.

The SFU level of SARS-­CoV-­2 specific IFNg-­, IL2-­ and IFNg+IL2-­ MTC in response to S1 and SNMO peptides were evaluated at a median of 4.0 months after disease onset.

Our results show IFNg-­, IL2-­ and IFNg+IL2 -­producing MTC in response to specific SARS-­CoV-­2 antigen stimulation. The IFNg-­
MTC likely serve as effector MTC that provide immediate function
by the massive production of IFNg, whereas IL2-­  and IFNg+IL2-­ MTC represent central MTC that proliferate in lymphoid organs and supply new effectors.15,16 IL2-­MTC have been previously detected in convalescents.10,12,17-­20 Our results showing a lower
magnitude of IFNg-­MTC in pediatric subjects as compared with adults are corroborated with a recent study3 demonstrating that

in convalescents the magnitude of specific SARS-­CoV-­2T-­cell responses increases with age.
Both pediatric and adult convalescents demonstrated MTC-­ response to S1 and SNMO, including the spike, nucleoprotein membrane and open reading frame, that best represent responses to whole viral components. On the contrary, another study by Dowel et al,5 presents opposite results demonstrating higher humoral and MTC responses in the pediatric population. A possible explanation for this discrepancy could be attributed to different baseline immunity between pediatric cohorts.3,5 Dowel et al report that the pediatric group had higher cross-­reactivity with previous beta-­coronaviruses (OC-­43, HKU-­1) or alpha-­coronaviruses (NL-­63, 229E) than adults, which eventually boosted IgG and T cells' reactivity.5 Notably, Cohen et al3 analyzed a pediatric cohort that was characterized by lower cross-­reactivity with previous common cold-­CoV infections and this cohort was characterized by lower adaptive response than adults.3 Although we did not monitor the cross-­reactivity with previous coronaviruses, yet based on our results, we cannot exclude that our pediatric group more resemble the cohort described by Cohen et al..3 Moreover, our results at least in part of IgG titer and frequency of MBC and MTC are corroborated with a recent study by Rowntree et al showing a low frequency of MTC and MBC pediatric subjects as compared with adults.4
The observed differences in adaptive immunity between pediatric and adult convalescents are likely owing to patient age and the associated rich common cold b-­corona virus exposure history in pediatric and adult patients with enriched specific MBC and MTC.21,22 Here, we demonstrate that while frequencies of MBC-­ positive subjects in pediatric and adult groups are comparable,

pediatric subjects are characterized by lower SFU magnitude of RBD-­specific MBC response. The role of MBC and MTC in SARS-­ CoV-­2 re-­infection is unclear, however, in a mice model of influenza it was demonstrated that the low level of MTC, maintained in the periphery dictates an insufficient level of protection during a secondary pathogen challenge.23,24 Notably, in view of the waning of SARS-­CoV-­2 IgG and specific memory cells several months following immunization,7,25-­28 it has been demonstrated that the number of pre-­existed memory cells could be boosted by repeated vaccinations.28 A study by Yoshida et al.29 suggests a possible explanation for diminished adaptive immunity in pediatric convalescents. This study demonstrates higher expression of antiviral IFN-­related genes in nasal, tracheal and bronchial airways in pediatric than in adult COVID-­19 patients, which may restrict viral systemic spread in children.29 The authors suggest that lower systemic viral load in children could be associated with lower adaptive memory during the convalescence period, which indeed is demonstrated in our study. In accordance, we assume that activated antiviral IFN-­related mechanism in upper respiratory tracts of pediatric subjects will restrict the viral spread and protect from serious outcomes also in case of re-­infection. We do not have follow-­up data regarding re-­infections in our cohort. Yet, a recent publication by Mensah et al. reported a lower risk for COVID-­19 re-­infections in the pediatric population (<16years) as compared to adults, suggesting that low adaptive immunity is not associated with a higher risk for re-­infections.30 These results sustain the crucial role of innate immunity as previously proposed by Yoshida et al.29
There are number of limitations in our study. Because of the difficulty to obtain a parental signed consent for pediatric healthy subjects the cutoffs for magnitude and frequency of positive humoral and adaptive immune responses for pediatric convalescents were assessed from healthy adults. Of note, our study focused on both SARS-­CoV-­2 PCR and IgG positive convalescents and further study is needed to evaluate adaptive immunity in PCR positive and IgG negative subjects. While the pediatric cohort was characterized by a mild clinical presentation at disease onset, we restricted our adult cohort to convalescent subjects that were characterized by mild symptoms and our conclusions are questionable in subjects with severe disease.
In regard to the MBC assay, we cannot exclude that the detected spots likely represent both MBC and plasmablasts. The term MTC refer to all antigen-­specific T cell, including effectors and memory.
5 | CONCLUSION
Our study demonstrated a low magnitude of MBC and IL2-­MTC, frequency and magnitude of IFNg-­MTC in non-­vaccinated COVID-­19 pediatric convalescents as compared with adults, suggesting relatively low adaptive responsiveness, that sustains the recommendation for vaccination of the pediatric population.

ABSTRACT Objective New-­onset immune-­mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) and flares of pre-e­ xisting IMIDs have been reported following anti- SARS-­CoV2 vaccination. Our study aimed at describing a retrospective cohort of patients developing new-o­ nset IMIDs or flares of known IMIDs within 30 days after any anti-­SARS-­CoV2 vaccine dose. Methods We evaluated clinical records of all inpatients and outpatients referring to our institution between February 2021 and February 2022 with any clinical manifestations. We then selected those having received any anti-S­ ARS-­CoV2 vaccine dose within the prior 30 days and classified them as having or not a previous IMID according to predefined criteria. We recorded new-­onset IMIDs or flares of known IMIDs and investigated any relationship with demographic, clinical and serological variables. Results 153 patients that received any anti-­SARS-­CoV2 vaccine dose within the previous 30 days were included of which 45 (29%) already had a diagnosis of IMID while 108 (71%) had no previously diagnosed IMID. 33 (30%) of the 108 patients, were diagnosed with a new-­onset IMID. Pericarditis, polymyalgia rheumatica and vasculitis were the most frequent conditions. Among the 45 patients that already had an IMID, disease flare was the reason for referral in 69% of patients. Patients with an IMID flare had a lower number of comorbidities and tended to be younger compared with those who developed other conditions after anti-­SARS-­CoV2 vaccination. Conclusion We provided a retrospective overview of a cohort of patients who developed new-­onset IMIDs or flares of known IMIDs within 30 days after any dose of anti-S­ ARS-­CoV2 vaccine. While vaccination campaigns proceed, postvaccination surveillance programmes are ongoing and hopefully will soon clarify whether a causal relationship between vaccines and new-o­ nset/flares of IMIDs exists.
INTRODUCTION Over the last decades, evidence on the association between vaccinations and autoimmunity has accrued. Such evidence mainly

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
 Mass vaccination represents the turning point against the pandemic; however, anti- SARS-C­oV2 vaccines may induce various adverse reactions like other vaccines and medicinal products.
 New-­onset autoimmune manifestations and flares of pre-­existing immune-­mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) following anti- SARS-C­oV2 vaccination are being reported but solid evidence of a causal relationship is still lacking.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
 This is one of the largest unselected cohorts of patients developing new-­onset IMID or flares of pre-­ existing IMID following anti- SARS-C­ oV2 vaccination.
 Pericarditis, polymyalgia rheumatica and vasculitis are the most frequently observed new-­onset IMID.
HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY
 Clinicians should be aware that fully blown IMIDs as well as autoimmune features not fulfilling the available classification criteria may occur shortly after anti- SARS-­CoV2 vaccination in previously healthy people.
 While postvaccination surveillance programmes and ongoing follow-­up will ensure data collection on these associations to assess causality, anti- SARS-­ CoV2 vaccination campaigns should proceed due to the strong efficacy evidence in reducing the virus spread and protecting against severe forms of COVID-­19.
pertained to human papillomavirus, hepatitis B and influenza vaccines which were suggested as triggers of aberrant autoimmune responses.1-3 However, since 2019, the worldwide spreading of SARS-­CoV2 infection led to the prompt development of new vaccines and as the vaccination campaign spreads out, a consistent amount of data on

the safety of these vaccines has been collected. As of 21 June 2022, 24 vaccines are currently in use4 and 11 912 594 538 vaccine doses have been administrated worldwide.5 Among the available compounds developed using different platforms, mRNA-b­ased (BNT162b2, mRNA-­ 1273) and adenovirus vector (ChAdOx1, Ad26.COV2.S) vaccines are those most broadly used and adverse reactions to SARS-C­ oV2 vaccination have been reported in association with both types of vaccines. Besides mild self-­limiting adverse events such as injection site pain, some other adverse events raised concerns in the scientific community and in the public. In March 2021, the European Medicines Agency described a worrisomely high number of cases of thrombocytopaenia associated with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis after the administration of the ChAdOx1 vaccine. A pathogenic mechanism similar to heparin-i­nduced thrombocytopaenia was postulated and the subsequent demonstration of circulating anti-­factor 4 (PF4)-heparin antibodies confirmed the autoimmune nature of this vaccine-­induced condition.6 Vaccine-­induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia (VITT) was subsequently described also in association with mRNA-b­ased vaccines alongside other vaccine-­induced immune-m­ ediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) such as autoimmune liver diseases and IgA nephropathy among others.7-9 However, whether the association between anti- SARS-C­ oV2 vaccine and new-­ onset IMIDs is causal or coincidental is still a matter of debate.10
Here, we provide a retrospective overview of inpatients and outpatients referring to our institution who developed new-o­ nset IMIDs or flares of known IMIDs.
METHODS Patient cohort Clinical records of all inpatients and outpatients referring to either our Internal Medicine and Nephrology ward or our Immuno-­Rheumatology service at the University of L'Aquila, Italy, between February 2021 and February 2022 were reviewed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were in accordance with WHO guidelines for surveillance of adverse events following immunisation11 which represent a rationale question-­based process to identify the eligible cases (online supplemental figure S1). In particular, the entry criterion for the study was having received any anti-­ SARS-C­ oV2 vaccine dose within the prior 30 days. Then we classified the included patients as IMID or no-I­MID according to the following criteria: no IMID patients had neither a prevaccination diagnosis of IMID nor a prevaccination clinical suspicion of IMID leading to specific laboratory and clinical assessment. Among IMID patients, those with a flare who discontinued or reduced for more than 30 days the immunosuppressive therapy prior vaccination were excluded.
Statistical analysis Data were analysed with IBM-S­PSS V.28 software. Variables were compared using either the 2 test or the

Mann-­Whitney U test as needed. Bivariate correlation (Spearman's ) and binary logistic regression analysis were also performed. All tests were two tailed and values of p<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS Between February 2021 and February 2022, 2519 patients were admitted to our institution (either the Internal Medicine and Nephrology ward or our Immuno-R­ heumatology service) with various clinical manifestations. Among these, we identified 153 patients (105 inpatients and 48 outpatients) that received any anti-S­ARS-­CoV2 vaccine dose within the 30 days before admission. Two out of 105 inpatients deceased during in-h­ ospital stay.
Of these 153 patients, 45 (29%) already had a diagnosis of IMID while 108 (71%) had no previously diagnosed IMID (table 1). Of these 108 patients, 88 were inpatients and 20 were outpatients. A new-o­nset IMID was diagnosed in 33 (30%) of the 108 patients. However, when assessing the data according to the setting, new-­onset IMID were diagnosed in 13/88 (15%) inpatients and 20/20 (100%) outpatients (table 1). None of these 33 patients had familiar history of IMID. When comparing the patients developing or not a new-­onset IMID, we did not observe any difference with regard to gender, type of anti- SARS-­CoV2 vaccine, number of doses received prior to the symptom onset, age, duration of in-­hospital stays or number/type of comorbidities.
Table 2 shows the prevalence of the presenting complaints of the 88 inpatients without previous IMID. Abdominal pain (with or without diarrhoea), fatigue, fever and dyspnoea were the most frequent reasons for admission of inpatients regardless of the diagnosis at discharge. Conversely chest pain was more frequently reported by inpatients subsequently diagnosed with IMID (p<0.001). As shown in table 3, 20 outpatients with no history of IMID that subsequently were diagnosed with IMID, were referred mainly for arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, pain and stiffness of the shoulder and hip girdle, erythematous cutaneous lesions and morning stiffness.
Table 4 shows the newly diagnosed IMIDs in the 33 patients and the number of doses received prior IMID diagnosis. With regard to the timing of symptom onset, online supplemental table S1 shows that symptoms in the majority of patients with new-o­ nset IMIDs occurred within the first week after vaccination regardless of the number of doses received. Furthermore, all the patients developing a new-o­ nset IMID after three vaccine doses reported symptoms as early as week 1.
With regard to autoantibodies, both patients with autoimmune thrombocytopaenia displayed antiplatelet antibodies but not anti-P­ F4 antibodies, while of the two patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) one displayed high titers of both anticardiolipin and anti-­ beta2GPI IgG antibodies but a negative lupus anticoagulant (LAC) and the other displayed a positive LAC but neither anticardiolipin nor anti-b­ eta2GPI IgG antibodies.

Table 5 shows the features of the 45 patients with pre-­ existing IMID (N=17 inpatients; N=28 outpatients) and the reasons for referral, among which an IMID flare was the most frequent (31/45, 69%). Patients with a disease flare had a lower number of comorbidities (p=0.04), although no differences in the type of comorbidities was observed, and tended to be younger than those who developed other vaccine-r­ elated conditions (table 6). All the 3 patients who were referred after the booster dose showed a disease flare. In addition, we observed numerical differences, although not significant, with regard to the clinical picture that occurred after the first or second dose of the regular vaccination schedule. In fact, in about half of the patients who experienced a disease flare it happened after the first dose and in about 30% after the second dose. Conversely, other vaccine related conditions appeared mainly after the second dose (71% of patients), to a lesser extent after the first dose (29%) and never after the third dose. With regard to the timing of flare onset, online supplemental table S2 shows that they occurred within the first week after vaccination regardless of the number of doses received.
Finally, regarding flare outcomes, 21 (68%) patients had a complete response to the treatment, 2 (6%) had a partial response and 8 (26%) had no response requiring further adjustment of treatment.
DISCUSSION As of 21 June 2022, 136 206 350 doses of anti-S­ ARS-­CoV2 vaccines have been administrated in Italy. This corresponds to a coverage of 85.2% of the population with

a least one dose (including single-d­ose vaccines) and 80.4% of the population with two doses.5 Although it is evident that vaccines have considerably reduced the incidence of serious manifestations linked to the SARS-C­ oV2 infection and that the mass vaccination represents the turning point against the pandemic, a broad spectrum of vaccine-­induced manifestations, including new-o­ nset IMIDs, have been reported. We described a retrospective cohort of 153 patients that were admitted to our
6

institution within 30 days of the vaccine dose. Of these, 33 patients were diagnosed with new-o­nset IMID. In more detail, new-o­ nset IMIDs were diagnosed in all the 20 patients referring for the first time to our Immuno-­ Rheumatology service with clinical suspicion of IMID. Conversely, although only 4 of the 88 inpatients admitted to our internal medicine ward within 30 days from any anti- SARS-­CoV2 vaccine dose had a clinical suspicion of

IMID, we ultimately diagnosed an IMID in 13 of the 88 patients.
The main mechanisms through which anti-S­ ARS-­CoV2 vaccine may trigger autoimmunity include molecular mimicry, the production of autoantibodies and the role of vaccine adjuvants.10 As demonstrated for other vaccines such as human papilloma virus and influenza, the cross-­ reaction between viral proteins and tissue auto-­antigens may lead to the development of an aberrant autoimmune response by means of molecular mimicry. However, the low incidence of vaccine-i­nduced IMIDs underscores the importance of genetic predisposition to facilitate the disease development only in a small subgroup of vaccinated people. This process may also occur with regard to anti-S­ ARS-­CoV2 vaccine due to the similarity of SARS-C­ oV2 proteins and tissue antigens. With regard to the production of autoantibodies, VITT represents an example of antibody-m­ ediated vaccine-i­nduced IMID that deserves to be discussed. Initially believed to pertain only to adenovirus vector vaccines, VITT was subsequently described also in association with mRNA-­based vaccines.7 Patients with VITT display antibodies targeting PF-­4 and mediating their effect through IgG-­FcR interactions and complement activation.12 13 Of interest, however, vaccine induced anti-­PF4 do not cross-­react with the SARS-­CoV2 spike protein.14 Finally, vaccine adjuvants as well as the mRNA included in vaccines may trigger autoimmunity via the inflammasome pathway being recognised by toll like receptors.15 On this basis, anti-­SARS-­CoV2 vaccine-­ induced IMIDs represent a challenge for clinicians since the interaction between the vaccine and the immune system needs to be fully elucidated while patients may develop not only fully blown IMIDs but also autoimmune features not fulfilling the available classification criteria.
In our cohort, the most frequent new-o­ nset IMID was pericarditis (14%), followed by polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) (11%) and vasculitis (11%).
As far as pericarditis is concerned, we previously reported a series of patients who developed pericarditis after a median of 20 days from clinical and virological recovery from SARS-C­ oV-­2 infection.16 Conversely in the current patient cohort, pericarditis developed between 10 and 15 days after the second (N 4/5) or third (N=1/5) dose of an mRNA vaccine.
Our data on PMR are somehow in line with the results of a multicentre Italian study reporting PMR-l­ike features as the most common clinical picture observed in rheumatology settings within 4 weeks after an anti-­SARS-­CoV2 vaccine dose.17 In the study from Ursini et al PMR-­like features occurred after the first or the second dose of either mRNA-­based or adenovirus-­based vaccines. In addition, a case report from Manzo et al also described new-­onset PMR after the administration of the first dose of an mRNA-b­ ased vaccine.18 Conversely, in our cohort all cases of PMR occurred after the third vaccine dose and all patients had received mRNA-­based vaccines.
To date, several cases of vasculitis occurring after any anti-­SARS-C­oV2 vaccine have been reported ranging

Autoimmunity
from giant cell arteritis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-­associated vasculitis, cutaneous lymphocytic vasculitis and IgA vasculitis.19-24 In our retrospective cohort, we observed 4 cases of new-o­ nset vasculitis. Three patients received the ChAdOx1 vaccine while one received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Of interest, all the cases that followed the ChAdOx1 vaccine (one GCA, one leukocytoclastic vasculitis and one ANCA-a­ssociate vasculitis) occurred after the first dose while the case that followed the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (IgA vasculitis) occurred after the booster dose with an mRNA-b­ ased vaccine.
The link between ChAdOx1 vaccine and new-o­nset vasculitis may recognise a role for both molecular mimicry/adjuvant effects and endothelial damage. In fact, during acute SARS-C­ oV-­2 infection vasculitis may be induced by direct endothelial damage. As mentioned above, ChAdOx1 vaccine can induce anti-P­ F4 antibodies and therefore interfere with the endothelial/coagulation homoeostasis.19 With regard to autoantibodies, it is important to mention that none of the three patients developing thrombocytopaenia in our cohort (two of which after ChAdOx1 vaccine) displayed anti-­PF4 antibodies but rather they tested positive for antiplatelet antibodies hence being diagnosed with autoimmune thrombocytopaenia.
Arthralgia is rather common after any anti-­SARS-­CoV2 vaccines, occurring in up to 30% of people.25 26 Arthritis is less frequent; however, it is not necessarily a red flag for a subsequent diagnosis of IMID. In fact, reports of new-­onset chronic inflammatory arthritis are scarce and mainly pertain to rheumatoid arthritis (RA).27 It is important to mention, however, that since RA autoantibodies may occur years before the clinical phase of the disease, it is not possible to rule out whether anti-­ SARS-­CoV2 vaccine induced only the articular manifestations or also a seroconversion.
Finally with regard to patients with a pre-­existing IMID that developed post-v­accine symptoms, the most frequent cause for referral was a disease flare (69%). A recent systematic literature review of studies enrolling vaccinated patients with RMDs found no postvaccination disease flare in 868 patients.28 Conversely, a report from the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology COVAX registry (N=1375) and the COVID-1­9 Global Rheumatology Alliance Vaccine Survey Group (N=5619) described a disease flare in about 5% of patients, of whom only a minority experienced a severe flare or requiring a change in treatment.29 30 Differences concerning disease type and activity, ongoing treatment, discontinuation/ reduction of immunosuppressive therapy prior vaccination, comorbidities, demographic factors and vaccine type may account for the variability of these data.
The main limitation of our study is its retrospective nature, therefore our results need to be integrated with evidence from future controlled, prospective studies.
In conclusion, anti-S­ARS-­CoV2 vaccines may induce various adverse reactions like other vaccines and medicinal products. In particular, evidence of new-o­ nset IMIDs

and IMIDs flares has accrued but post vaccination surveillance programmes, population-b­ased and prospective clinical studies are needed to ensure data collection on these associations to assess causality. Solid evidence on the mechanisms of interaction between vaccine and immune system, the role of genetic predisposition, disease type and activity, ongoing treatment and other variables, will shed additional light on the controversial link between anti-­SARS-C­ oV2 vaccine and autoimmunity. Nonetheless, with billions of individuals worldwide now immunised with a least one dose of an anti-­SARS-­CoV2 vaccine, real-­ life observational data are in line with evidence from clinical trials and support their efficacy and safety.

ABSTRACT Objectives To correlate immune responses following a two-­dose regimen of mRNA anti-­SARS-­CoV-­2 vaccines in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to the development of a potent neutralising antiviral activity. Methods The RECOVER study was a prospective, monocentric study including patients with RA and healthy controls (HCs). Assessments were performed before, and 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks, after the first vaccine dose, respectively, and included IgG, IgA and IgM responses (against receptor binding domain, S1, S2, N), IFN- ELISpots as well as neutralisation assays. Results In patients with RA, IgG responses developed slower with lower peak titres compared with HC. Potent neutralising activity assessed by a SARS-C­ oV-­2 pseudovirus neutralisation assay after 12 weeks was observed in all 21 HCs, and in 60.3% of 73 patients with RA. A significant correlation between peak anti-­S IgG levels 2weeks after the second vaccine dose and potent neutralising activity against SARS-­CoV-­2 was observed at weeks 12 and 24. The analysis of IgG, IgA and IgM isotype responses to different viral proteins demonstrated a delay in IgG but not in IgA and IgM responses. T cell responses were comparable in HC and patients with RA but declined earlier in patients with RA. Conclusion In patients with RA, vaccine-­induced IgG antibody levels were diminished, while IgA and IgM responses persisted, indicating a delayed isotype switch. Anti-­S IgG levels 2weeks after the second vaccine dose correlate with the development of a potent neutralising activity after 12 and 24 weeks and may allow to identify patients who might benefit from additional vaccine doses or prophylactic regimen.
INTRODUCTION The development of safe and effective COVID-1­ 9 vaccines has been a milestone in controlling the pandemic.1 2 While longitudinal studies in SARS-C­oV-­2 convalescent

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
 mRNA SARS-C­oV-­2 vaccine-­induced immune and antiviral responses are impaired in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
 There is uncertainty whether and when monitoring of anti-S­ responses might guide individual patient management.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
 Longitudinal data up to 24 weeks demonstrate impaired humoral immune responses in patients with RA versus healthy controls while T cell responses are largely maintained.
 Immunoglobulin isotype kinetics demonstrate that partial versus full seroconversion occurs more frequently in patients with RA compared with healthy controls suggesting a delayed isotype switch.
 A significant proportion of patients with RA do not develop potent neutralising antibody responses.
 Postvaccination anti-­S responses predict the subsequent development of potent neutralising antibody activity up to 24 weeks.
HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY
 The determination of anti-­S titres early after the second vaccine dose allows to identify patients with a low likelihood of a protective humoral immune response.
 Optimisation of SARS-­CoV-2­ vaccine strategies, depending on the DMARD regimen, is needed and may include pausing DMARD therapy, application of an early third vaccine dose or the use of prophylactic antibodies.
and vaccinated individuals have revealed the dynamics of humoral and cellular immune responses in healthy individuals, data on long-­ term vaccine-i­nduced immune responses in

patients with rheumatic diseases are still scarce.3-5 Two doses of mRNA-­based anti-­SARS-­CoV-2­ vaccines result in durable SARS-­CoV-2­ antibody binding that correlate to potent neutralisation responses in healthy volunteers.6 7 Most patients with rheumatic diseases seroconvert following mRNA vaccination but anti-S­ titres may develop with a delayed kinetic and lower magnitude compared with healthy controls (HCs) depending on the immunomodulatory therapies used.8-10
Lower anti-S­ levels in patients on immunomodulatory therapies may translate into a lower level of protection. The observation that vaccine effectiveness for prevention of symptomatic COVID-1­9 in immunosuppressed patients is significantly lower compared with immunocompetent controls supports this hypothesis.11 12 Immunomodulatory therapies may reduce or prevent antibody responses following SARS-C­ oV-2­ vaccination. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the use of JAK inhibitors (tsDMARDs), abatacept or rituximab has been associated with reduced anti-S­ responses.13-16 Reports on decreasing antibody titres over time and the emergence of variants of concern contribute to the uncertainty about the potency and durability of the vaccine induced protection in immunocompromised patients.17-19 Efforts seem warranted to optimise vaccine strategies in immunocompromised patients.
The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the updated European League against Rheumatism recommendations support a third mRNA vaccine dose in all patients with autoimmune diseases.20 21 Although currently not recommended in daily practice, the determination of vaccine-­induced antibody responses may help to guide management in patients who are considered to be at risk for an impaired immune response.
The aim of our study was to assess vaccine-i­nduced immune responses following a two-­dose regimen of mRNA-­based anti-­SARS-­CoV-­2 vaccines over 24 weeks and to analyse the development of neutralising activity against SARS-­CoV-2­ in patients with RA on DMARD therapies compared with HCs.
METHODS Study participants The RECOVER trial (Rheumatoid COVID-1­9 Vaccine Immune Response) is a non-r­andomised, prospective, observational, monocentric control group trial. The vaccination itself was not part of the study and performed according to Swiss federal regulations. Consecutive patients with RA on DMARD therapy willing to undergo vaccination were included in our trial. HC mainly consisted of healthcare workers. All participants provided written informed consent before enrolment.
Blood sampling was performed at six study visits: baseline (T0; before first vaccine dose), 3 (T1), 6 (T2, 2 weeks after the second vaccination), 12 (T3) and 24 (T4) weeks after the first vaccine dose. Demographics, medication and clinical data were recorded at all time points.

Serological testing and neutralisation assays Antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the SARS-C­ oV-­2 S1 protein (S) were measured with the Roche Elecsys Anti-­SARS-­CoV-­2-­S assay (range 0.4-2500U/mL, cut-o­ ff >0.8U/mL) and to SARS-C­ oV-­2 nucleocapsid (N) to exclude patients with previously unnoticed COVID-­19 infection.
The multiplex bead assay ABCORA was used to measure IgG, IgA and IgM reactivity to four SARS-C­ oV-­2 antigens (RBD, spike glycoprotein subunits S1 and S2, and nucleocapsid protein (N)) as described elsewhere.22 In brief, EDTA plasma is diluted (1/100) and incubated with antigen-­loaded MagPlex beads (Luminex Corporation, Austin, Texas, USA). To detect bound immunoglobulins (Ig), secondary phycoerythrin-l­abelled detector antibodies for IgG, IgA or IgM were used and median fluorescence intensity of the single dilution measurements was corrected for background binding (fold over empty beads). To distinguish SARS-C­ oV-­2-­specific from cross-r­ eactive antibodies, signal over cut-­off (SOC) values were defined for each of the 12 SARS-C­ oV-­2 antigen and Ig class combinations. Results are presented as the sum of S1 SOC values of IgG, IgA and IgM.
Antibody-­mediated neutralisation at week 12 was assessed against Wuhan-­Hu-­1 pseudovirus (HIV-­based) as described.23 Particles of the env-­inactivated HIV-­1 reporter construct pHIV-­1NL4-­3 Env-­NanoLuc (pHIV-­1Nanoluc; provided by P. Bieniasz, Rockefeller University, New York, USA) were pseudotyped with codon optimised, truncated SARS-­CoV-­2 spike expression plasmid (P_CoV2_Wuhan) by co-­expression in 293T cells. Infection of human ACE2 stable HeLa cells (Biogene, Shirley, New York, USA) with SARS-­CoV-­2 pseudoparticles was detected by measuring the NanoLuc luciferase reporter activity in cell lysates 48hours post infection using the Nano-G­ lo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin, USA) on a Perkin Elmer EnVision reader. Neutralisation tests of diluted plasma were performed and neutralisation titres causing 50% reduction in viral infectivity (NT50) compared with controls without plasma were calculated using GraphPad Prism with constraints (bottom=0, top=100). If 50% inhibition was not achieved at the lowest plasma dilution of 1/100, a `100' value was recorded. All measurements were conducted as single measurements.
T cell responses IFN- ELISpots detecting SARS-C­ oV-­2 Spike glycoprotein-­ reactive T cells after in vitro stimulation with a spike glycoprotein peptide mix were performed as described elsewhere (detailed in online supplemental file 1).24
Statistical analysis Baseline demographics and laboratory parameters were analysed using descriptive statistics. Comparisons of serological response between patients and controls and between different treatment groups were performed by the Wilcoxon paired samples test and Mann-W­ hitney test for unpaired samples. 2 test was applied for the

Spearman's correlation test was used to detect associations between continuous variables using GraphPad Prism V.9.0. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess predictability and results expressed as area under the curve (AUC).

or confirmed previous COVID-1­ 9 infection and patients with RA treated with rituximab were excluded.
Baseline characteristics of patients and HC are summarised in table 1. Patients with RA were older than HC (mean age 64±12.5 vs 44.1±13.8 years, p<0.0001). At baseline, 22 of 77 (28.6%) patients with RA received monotherapy with conventional (cs) DMARDs, the majority of them with methotrexate (MTX) (15/22, 68.2%) with a median weekly dose of 15mg (10-20) or leflunomide (6/22). Thirty-­five of 77 (45.5%) patients with RA received biological (b)DMARDs (19 TNF inhibitors, 5 IL-6 receptor inhibitors, 10 abatacept, 1 anakinra), 14 (40%) as monotherapy. JAK inhibitors (tsDMARDs) were used in 20/77 (26%) patients, in 8 (40%) as monotherapy. Medication was continued throughout the vaccination period. Four (5.2%) patients with RA had antibodies to nucleoprotein at

baseline in line with a clinically unnoticed COVID-­19 infection and were excluded from the immunogenicity analyses. After 12 weeks, three patients with absent anti-­S antibodies received a third vaccine dose, one of these patients had underlying RA-ILD, developed COVID-1­ 9 3months after the third dose and died. Two patients declined further participation. Sixty-e­ight of the remaining 73 (93.2%) patients were followed until week 24 after vaccination.
RA disease activity was prospectively assessed using CDAI until week 12. At baseline, 17/77 (22.1%) and 40/77 (51.9%) patients with RA were in remission or low disease activity. Significant increases in CDAI were noted after the first and second vaccination (p<0.0001) and after 12 weeks (p<0.001), and RA treatment was modified in 11/77 (14.3%) patients with RA (online supplemental figure 1).
Anti-S IgG responses to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine We longitudinally assessed the antibody response to SARS-­ CoV-­2 S antigen detected by the Elecsys Anti-­SARS-­CoV-­2 assay (anti-S­ ) in patients with RA and HC. The majority of patients with RA (92%) seroconverted 12 weeks after the first vaccine dose (T3), nine patients did not mount a response even after two doses. Anti-S­ levels were significantly lower in patients with RA compared with HC at all time points after two vaccine doses (T2, T3, T4) (figure 1A, online supplemental figure 2). Anti-S­ levels of patients with RA treated with csDMARD-m­ ono versus anti-­cytokine bDMARDs-­mono/combo were comparable at week 12. At week 24, patients receiving anti-c­ytokine bDMARDs-­mono/combo showed significantly lower anti-­S levels compared with patients on csDMARD-m­ ono (median 94 (37-218) vs 388 (165-734) U/mL), p=0.02. Patients using anti-­cytokine bDMARDs-­mono had numerically higher anti-­S levels (median 152 (42-507) U/mL) compared with patients on anti-c­ytokine bDMARDs-­ combo (median 70 (28-192) U/mL).
Patients treated with abatacept showed numerically lower anti-­S levels at week 12 compared with patients with csDMARD-­mono (median 158 (41-498) vs 782 (176-1216)U/mL), p=0.08, and significantly lower levels at week 24 (median 66 (21-94) vs 388 (165-734) U/ mL), p<0.01. In patients on tsDMARDs, anti-S­ levels were significantly lower compared with patients on csDMARD-­ mono at 12 and 24 weeks (median 132 (29-542) and 64 (18-224) vs 782 (176-1216) and 388 (165-734) U/mL), p<0.05and p<0.01, respectively.
There was no association between disease activity as monitored by CDAI or seropositivity and anti-S­ levels at any timepoint.
As the mean age of patients with RA was higher compared with HC, we matched patients with RA with HCs regarding age and type of vaccination. Patients with RA revealed significantly lower anti-­S levels at all timepoints following vaccination whereas T cell responses did not differ (online supplemental figure 3A,B).

Neutralising activity against SARS-CoV-2 The neutralising potency of the measured antibody response is a critical correlate of protective immunity after vaccination. We measured the neutralising activity in patients with RA and HCs using a pseudovirus-­ neutralisation assay against Wuhan-H­ u-­1 at week 12. All HCs developed high neutralisation titres compared with patients with RA. 39.7% of patients with RA did not mount a potent neutralising response (NT250) (p=0.0003) and the absence of neutralising activity at week 12 (NT50100) was noted in 23.3% patients with RA. The absence of neutralising activity was noted more frequently in patients with RA on abatacept or tsDMARDs, compared with patients with RA on csDMARDs-m­ ono or anti-­cytokine bDMARDs-­mono/combo (figure 1B).
Seroprofiling with the ABCORA assay allows to predict whether infected individuals develop high (NT50>250) or low neutralisation titres (NT50250), respectively, by the sum of S1 signal over cut-o­ ff (SOC) values for IgG, IgA, IgM (sum S1) against different viral antigens. The sum S1 threshold of 17.3 reliably predicts neutralisation activity against the vaccine strain Wuhan-­Hu-­1 with a specificity of 94% and a sensitivity of 67%.22 All HCs in our study exceeded the sum S1 predicting potent neutralisation at all timepoints following two vaccination doses. In contrast, patients with RA had significantly lower sum S1 levels at all timepoints (figure 1C).
Postvaccination anti-S levels predict neutralising activity after 12 and 24 weeks A strong correlation between anti-S­ antibody levels 2weeks after the second vaccine dose and a potent neutralising activity (NT50) at week 12 was observed. Patients with RA with NT50>250 at week 12 had significantly higher anti-S­ levels 2weeks after the second vaccine dose compared with patients with RA with low or absent neutralising activity (median 1769 (634-2500) vs 131 (0.4-409) and 0.65 (0-129), p<0.0001and p=0.0001, respectively) (figure 2A). We confirmed the correlation between peak anti-­S levels after the second vaccine dose (T2) and NT50 at 12 weeks (T3) by using the spearman correlation coefficient (r=0.5506) and linear regression (F=69.99), p<0.0001. A ROC curve with an AUC (AUC=0.8726, 95%CI 0.80 to 0.95), p<0.0001, revealed a decisive anti-S­ threshold of 937U/mL (figure 2B). Sum S1 levels as determined by the ABCORA assay allow to predict neutralising responses by measuring isotype responses to four different viral antigens. Peak anti-­S IgG antibody levels correlated to neutralising responses as predicted by ABCORA (sum S1) at week 12 (T3) (r=0.78 (CI 0.67 to 0.86), p<0.0001) and week 24 (T4) (r=0.67 (CI 0.50 to 0.79), p<0.0001) (figure 2C,D).
Analysis of SARS-specific IgG, IgA and IgM isotype responses The longitudinal analysis of isotype responses against four SARS-­CoV-­2 antigens (RBD, S1, S2 and N) using the ABCORA assay allows to differentiate partial (only IgA and IgM responses) and full seroconversion (including

IgG responses). Our analysis revealed a differential dynamic of the humoral response between patients with RA and HC (figure 3A). IgG responses to S1 and RBD that show the highest correlation with neutralising activity developed in patients with RA with a slower kinetic and lower magnitude while IgA responses tended to persist (figure 3A). IgM antibodies directed against RBD and S1 persisted longer in patients with RA compared with HCs (7.7% RBD and 12.3%S1 IgM positive vs 0% RBD and 5%S1 IgM positive in HC at week 12). Heatmaps at T1, T2 and T3 reveal the dynamics of isotype evolutions against different viral antigens in patients with RA

compared with HC (figure 3B). These data suggest a delayed isotype switch in patients with RA following anti-­ SARS-­CoV-­2 vaccination that may underlie the delay in the development of strong IgG responses.
SARS-CoV-2 specific IFN- release The number of IFN--spot forming cells (s.f.c) was comparable between HC and patients with RA, with a peak 2weeks after the second vaccine dose (T2) and decrease thereafter. In patients with RA, a more rapid decline was noted at week 24 compared with HC (online supplemental figure 4). No significant differences regarding the T cell

DISCUSSION The successful development of vaccines for COVID-­19 has altered the course and severity of the pandemic, but vaccine efficacy against SARS-­CoV-2­ variants may lag behind the spread of new variants and anti-­S antibodies may wane over time. The importance of a robust humoral immune response is supported by the clinical efficacy of therapeutic and prophylactic antibodies against the spike protein and studies confirmed a reduced occurrence of COVID-1­ 9 infections in participants with higher vaccine-­ induced anti-S­ or RBD IgG antibodies correlating with higher pseudovirus neutralisation titres.25-28
Patients with rheumatic diseases who receive immunomodulatory therapies may develop blunted

vaccine-­induced immune responses compared with the healthy population, thus likely reflecting a lower level of protection in these patients.29 Breakthrough SARS-­CoV-­2 infections in fully vaccinated patients with rheumatic diseases resulting in severe disease courses have been reported.30 Optimising vaccine strategies is therefore of interest in this patient population.
The ACR has recommended a third mRNA vaccine dose to patients with rheumatic diseases, that may be applied at least 28 days after the second dose of the primary vaccination series.20 The optimal timepoint and threshold levels of vaccine-i­nduced immune responses have not yet been determined. The determination of anti-­S antibody levels given their correlation to neutralisation therefore represents an attractive option in immunocompromised patients to monitor vaccine effectiveness and guide clinical management.31 32
In this prospective, longitudinal study, patients with RA showed significantly lower anti-S­ titres at all timepoints

than HC. While patients with RA using anti-c­ytokine bDMARDs in monotherapy showed anti-S­ levels comparable to those of patients on csDMARD monotherapy after 12 and 24 weeks, we observed lower anti-S­ levels in patients on tsDMARDs, abatacept or anti-c­ytokine bDMARDs in combination with csDMARDs as reported by others.33-35 Potent neutralising responses as determined by an HIV-­based pseudovirus system (NT50) and the multiplex ABCORA assay were detected in all HC but were absent in a large proportion of patients with RA. Of note, we observed a significant correlation between anti-S­ responses 2weeks after the second vaccine dose and the development of potent neutralisation activity as assessed by NT50 after 12 weeks and ABCORA after 12 and 24 weeks. The early determination of anti-­S titres 2weeks after the second vaccine dose may thus allow to identify patients with RA with a higher likelihood of low or absent neutralising antibodies thereafter who would benefit from an earlier third vaccine dose.
Patients with RA demonstrated significantly impaired neutralising responses as assessed by ABCORA at all timepoints following a standard vaccination regimen. Of note, IgG responses to spike antigens show the highest correlation with neutralisation activity.22 The development of a robust IgG response to S1, S2 and RBD was significantly

delayed in patients with RA compared with HC. Our findings suggest a delayed isotype switch in vaccine-­induced antibody development in patients with RA that might, at least in part, explain these findings. Further studies are needed to corroborate whether the delayed development of a vaccine-i­nduced IgG response is mitigated by the use of certain DMARDs which were continued throughout the vaccination period in our study or whether temporary interruption of DMARDs may promote the rapid development of IgG responses.36 37
Limitations of our study include the observational design, small patient numbers within subgroups on distinct therapies and the inability to differentiate between vaccine regimens using mRNA-1­273 and BNT162b2 in patients with RA. The younger age of the HCs (mainly healthcare workers) is a confounding factor that could not be corrected as priorisation for vaccination was performed according to federal regulations.
In conclusion, determination of vaccine-i­nduced anti-­S responses 2weeks after the second dose of an mRNA-b­ ased vaccine provides an opportunity to identify patients with an inadequate immune response to SARS-­CoV-­2 vaccination who are unlikely to develop neutralising activity 3 and 6months later. The optimal strategies in these patients still need to be explored and

Lessons from Israel's COVID19 Green Pass program
Shelly KaminFriedman1,2* and Maya Peled Raz3,4

Abstract
As of the beginning of March 2021, Israeli law requires the presentation of a Green Pass as a precondition for entering certain businesses and public spheres. Entitlement for a Green Pass is granted to Israelis who have been vaccinated with two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, who have recovered from COVID-19, or who are participating in a clinical trial for vaccine development in Israel. The Green Pass is essential for retaining immune individuals' freedom of move ment and for promoting the public interest in reopening the economic, educational, and cultural spheres of activity. Nonetheless, and as the Green Pass imposes restrictions on the movement of individuals who had not been vacci nated or who had not recovered, it is not consonant with solidarity and trust building. Implementing the Green Pass provision while advancing its effectiveness on the one hand, and safeguarding equality, proportionality, and fairness on the other hand may imbue this measure with ethical legitimacy despite involving a potential breach of trust and solidarity.

Key points
· Although the Green Pass may not be consonant with trust building or with the promotion of solidarity, it is essential for the realization of the freedom of movement and gathering and for resuming social activity.
· The possession of a Green Pass as a pre-condition for entering businesses and public places would only be an effective measure for reopening the economy and the cultural sphere of activity if it generates an economic incentive to businesses and venue owners.
· The implementation of the Green Pass program underscores the need for making vaccines accessible to vulnerable, and especially poor populations.
· Requiring employees to present a Green Pass as a condition of admission to their workplaces is pro-

portionate if employees are given the alternative of undergoing PCR or rapid antigen tests, and if the presentation of a Green Pass is essential for safe activity.
Introduction As of the beginning of March 2021, Israelis who have been vaccinated with two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, who have recovered from COVID-19, or who are currently participating in a clinical trial for vaccine development in Israel are entitled to a Green Pass. The Green Pass is a certificate which allows its holder to establish her or his immunization status and take part in various activities such as cultural and sports events, conferences, gym classes and workouts, exhibitions, swimming in public swimming pools, hotel stays, eating out at restaurants, and visiting tourist attractions, which were all closed intermittently since April 2020.
Provisions concerning the Green Pass are regulated by secondary legislation [1] enacted by the executive branch

within its authority to act to reduce the spread of the virus [2]. The Green Pass may be legally required for a changeable variety of venues and activities depending on the severity of the pandemic as advised by experts.
In spite of the uncertainty surrounding the long-term effectiveness of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine as well as its effectiveness against variants, the implementation of the Green Pass scheme was based on research confirming that infection with COVID-19 induces an immune response [3], and that vaccines are (as of now) effective in both preventing severe morbidity [4] and in reducing infection [5-8]. These assumptions hold in the face of the delta variant, though effectiveness in both aspects is estimated as lower compared to the alpha variant [9].
The ethics of the Green Pass can be assessed with respect to general moral considerations in public health, and first and foremost with respect to the aspiration toward the maximal balance of benefits over harms and other costs; the fair distribution of benefits and burdens; trust building, and promotion of solidarity [10-12].
The Green Pass allows immune individuals to retain their freedoms of movement and gathering, and promotes the public interest in reopening the economic, educational and cultural spheres of activity.
Nonetheless, and as the Green Pass program imposes restrictions on the movement of individuals who had not been vaccinated or who had not recovered, it is not consonant with the solidarity and trust building that are both central to public health.1
Unlike a call for a collective commitment to the common good without individual restrictions (as was utilized in Israel during the detection of poliovirus in 2013), the coercive legislation, which excludes unvaccinated individuals from businesses and public places can lead to a sense of alienation. Moreover, restrictions on individuals express distrust on the part of health authorities with
1 Trust between policy makers and the public alongside a sense of solidarity have been a cornerstone of Israeli public health actions since the establishment of the state of Israel and have led to high compliance rates with government recommendations in the field of public health. A notable example is the relatively high compliance rates attained with respect to polio vaccine recommendation in 2013, when wild polio was detected in Israeli sewage. Parents were asked to vaccinate their children with OPV (oral polio vaccine) although the children were already protected from the disease. The objective of the additional vaccination was to protect non-immune populations. The relatively high compliance rates in this case were attained without the need for sanctions. During the first two waves of the COVD-19 outbreak in Israel, trust and solidarity led to an impressive degree of public cooperation with the social distancing and lockdown guidelines. This, in turn, resulted in a rapid decline in morbidity. In December 2020, the initiation of Israel's vaccination campaign without constraints on those who avoid vaccination expressed policymakers' trust in the public's discretion and prevented unvaccinated individuals from feeling alienated [13].

respect to the non Green Pass holders' commitment to the collective efforts toward overcoming the pandemic.
The present article's purpose is thus to examine the Israeli experience in engaging and balancing ethical values during the implementation of the Green Pass program.
The necessity of the Green Pass Vaccine uptake in Israel is extensive. As of October 15, 2021, 64.8% of the population was vaccinated with 2 vaccine doses, including a very high proportion of the at-risk population (84.6% aged 50-59; 88.3% aged 60-69; 88.1% aged 70-79; 87.7% aged 80-89; and 80.2% over the age of 90). Nonetheless, there are currently about 700,000 Israelis who are entitled to receive the vaccine but who have nonetheless chosen not to get vaccinated.
The Green Pass was introduced in Israel with a dual purpose in mind: to allow (following the third COVID-19 wave) and to maintain (in the wake of the fourth wave) the opening of the economy, the education system, and the cultural sphere with a minimum risk of elevating morbidity, as well as to encourage vaccination [14].
The opening of the economy, the education system, and the cultural sphere is essential to social resilience [15]. Moreover, allowing vaccinated or recovered individuals to resume and maintain their daily routine is consonant with their rights to freedom of movement and gathering. Individuals who are immune to SARS-CoV-2 are expected to be at a vastly reduced risk of contracting and transmitting the virus, and requiring them to keep complying with social distance restrictions infringes extensively on their civil liberties and would be unjustified. Consequently, it is unethical to require people to avoid contact with others if they pose a minimal risk of spreading the virus [16].2
Therefore, and although the Green Pass may not correlate with trust building or the promotion of solidarity, it is ethically vital to consider its application under the Israeli circumstances.
2 We believe that, unlike the benefits of the Green Pass in resuming routine life activities and safely opening the economy, the use of the Green Pass as a means of pressuring people to be vaccinated is ethically problematic. Vaccine compliance should be promoted by accessibility and outreach efforts. Other measures for promoting vaccine compliance that have also been considered in Israel include monetary incentives to "fully vaccinated individuals", and the provision of the contact details of unvaccinated individuals to local authorities such as to allow local representatives to contact the unvaccinated and promote their compliance. Both interventions were not applied. The first and only direct incentive for vaccine uptake went into force on August 5th 2021. This legal provision stipulated that the unvaccinated population will only be eligible for 75% of state funded sick-days if they are required to quarantine themselves due to a positive COVID-19 test or due to close contact with someone else who had been confirmed as a carrier of COVID-19 [17].

The Green Pass as an effective measure for safely reopening the economy The assumption that the Green Pass is essential to the realization of the freedom of movement and gathering and to safely reopening the economy does not necessarily mean that it would be an effective measure under all circumstances.
Businesses and venue owners would only resume their activity following the Green Pass restrictions if they had an economic incentive for doing so.
This economic incentive would be diminished if the legislature applies further restrictions on the operation of the relevant businesses (i.e., limiting the number of customers allowed in or prohibiting the sale of food on the premises) over and above the requirement of barring non-Green Pass holders from entering the premises.
Moreover, an economic incentive hardly applies to businesses relying on a clientele consisting mainly of children under 12 who cannot presently be vaccinated and who do not possess a Green Pass. For example, the owners of Israeli amusement parks have stated that opening their business to Green Pass holders alone would not be profitable and hence not feasible [18].
Another relevant factor for the resumption of business activity under Green Pass provisions is the businesses' responsibility for its enforcement. In Israel, the duty to ensure that all those who enter venues operating under the Green Pass restrictions do indeed possess a Green Pass rests with the businesses' owners. Allowing entry to a non-Green Pass holder is an administrative offense punishable by a fine of 5000-10,000 NIS (ca. 1550-3100 USD) payable by the business owner. Business owners have argued that enforcing the Green Pass provisions requires the hiring of additional employees and reduces the economic feasibility of the businesses' opening.
Policy makers must therefore bear in mind that businesses will open in accordance with Green Pass provisions and allow vaccinated or recovered individuals to resume their routine if solutions are found for allowing children to enter relevant venues (for example, rapid COVID-19 testing as an alternative to the presentation of a Green Pass), and if other business restrictions or obligations are limited to a minimum.
It should also be borne in mind that businesses will only have an incentive to resume their activity under Green Pass provisions when the vaccine roll-out is at its peak and while a substantial part of the population has been vaccinated or has recovered. When a rather small percentage of the local population has been vaccinated or has recovered, businesses and public places do not have a big enough incentive to resume their activities. On the other hand, when most of the population is immune and communal immunity has been attained, the economic

and cultural spheres can resume their activity with no need for any mandatory limitations.
Equal access to vaccinations and the Green Pass The differentiation between vaccinated or recovering individuals who are entitled to the Green Pass and individuals who are not is relevant to interrupting infection and therefore does not infringe on the right to equality. Nonetheless, conditioning the admission to businesses and public places on the presentation of a proof of vaccination where accessibility to vaccinations is unequal would indirectly infringe on the right to equality.
Data published by the Israeli Ministry of Health suggests that vaccine compliance is higher among secular Jews and among more affluent sections of the population, which leaves the Arab-Israeli minority and the less welloff behind [19].
The main reasons for this uptake gap were, among others, accessibility difficulties due to the relatively late opening of vaccination centers designated for the Arab-Israeli population, as well as difficulties in accessing reliable information due to the comparatively meagre governmental efforts to fight fake news at an early stage [20].
Given that bringing every person down to the least advantaged position ("levelling down") would not--generally speaking--solve the problem of disadvantage [21], this uptake gap should not serve as a justification for refraining from the implementation of the Green Pass program. However, the implementation of such a program nonetheless underscores the need for making vaccines accessible to vulnerable, and especially poor, populations. Efforts toward making vaccines physically accessible may include individual outreach to those who have yet to be vaccinated, providing access to vaccination centers without the need for setting an appointment in advance (whether online or otherwise), and the use of mobile immunization clinics.
Alongside the right to equal physical access to vaccines, equality also requires health communications that are linguistically and culturally adapted to the needs of various communities. This, in turn, requires an investment in communicating health information in a variety of languages (the relevant languages in Israel would be Hebrew, Arabic, Russian, and Amharic) that would provide a suitable response to "fake news" which has been propagated in these languages on social networks, as well as the recruitment of opinion leaders and medical experts that would be both relevant to as well as respected by the various sub-communities in question.
Insofar as the ethical obligation to reduce the indirect infringement on the right to movement of the unvaccinated is concerned, the Green Pass initiative must be

accompanied by such alternatives as rapid COVID-19 testing. Although the results of such tests are less accurate, permitting admission to businesses and public places based on a negative rapid COVD-19 test should be viewed as a calculated and justified risk. The availability of alternatives is especially necessary in cases where the lack of eligibility is not due to choice, but to vaccine contraindications (children under 12 and those who are allergic to one or more vaccine components). In addition, and in a manner akin to the obligation to equal access to vaccines, equal access to COVID-19 tests must also be assured. To this end, rapid COVID-19 tests must be made financially available to all. Governments must act to reduce the price of such tests and to fully fund them in the case of children or other populations who cannot be vaccinated.
Proportionality in mandating a Green Pass The Israeli Green Pass is only required as a precondition for admission into places that are considered "luxuries", which serves the objective of reducing the violation of non-Green Pass holders' rights. The Pass is not required for admission to hospitals, clinics and pharmacies, which is necessary for the realization of the right to health, and public places that combine necessary business with the pursuit of leisure (such as shopping centers), have been opened to the public without restrictions.3
However, the legislature has not addressed the legitimacy of requiring a Green Pass from employees as a precondition for their continued employment or hiring. As a result, businesses and public places were allowed to open subject to the presentation of a Green Pass by visitors and customers, while their employees were not required by law to prove that they recovered from COVID-19 or that they were fully vaccinated.
In addressing this issue, the Deputy Attorney General of Israel has stated that employers' managerial prerogative in deciding to require their employees to present a Green Pass should be balanced against the rights of the working individual, including her or his right to autonomy over her or his body and her or his right to privacy. According to the Deputy Attorney General, it is inappropriate to impose a sweeping prohibition on employers to demand a Green Pass from their employees, but it
3 In accordance with Israeli regulations, and even though the Green Pass is not required for entry into shopping centers, it is required for entry into leisure businesses located in shopping centers. The lack of enforcement of the requirement to show a Green Pass upon entering these leisure businesses has provoked criticism. The owners of leisure businesses located outdoors have argued for unjust advantages held by leisure businesses located inside shopping centers. We would like to note in this respect that the exemption from the requirement of a Green Pass at critical businesses is legitimate as long as it is limited to those businesses only.

is also unwarranted to establish a general requirement to present a Green Pass without examining whether such a measure is proportionate. Each case should thus be examined in relation to the concrete circumstances of that specific workplace and every employer should also consider the feasibility of less intrusive alternatives.
This issue has been consequently presented to Israeli Labor Courts in two distinct cases of workers petitioning against their employers' requirement to present a Green Pass as a condition for entering the workplace and claiming that their rights had been unduly violated. In both cases, the courts ruled that the employers' demand was legitimate in light of the circumstances. More specifically, one case involved a teaching assistant who was barred from entering her workplace (a school for children with special needs) as she refused to be vaccinated or to present a negative COVID-19 test. In its decision, the court stated that "...In this case, the petitioner was required to present a negative COVID-19 test once a week... this is a proportionate and reasonable requirement. No less intrusive measure could have been taken against the petitioner given the nature of her work as a teaching assistant, which necessarily requires direct contact with unvaccinated children". The court added that "it is difficult to maintain physical distance and full masking given the children's nature and age..." [22].
The second case involved a supermarket cashier sent on unpaid leave due to her refusal to get vaccinated or to present a negative COVID-19 test every 3 days. In this case, the court ruled that "...The respondent's decision, made with the consent of the employees' union representatives, is proportionate and reasonable. It was based on a multi-layered [set of ] alternatives designed to allow the continued employment of the unvaccinated employees... There is no doubt that the petitioner's work as a cashier at a supermarket branch involves contact with a large number of customers and with other employees, some of whom may be members of at-risk populations, on a daily basis, a state of affairs which makes the employer's requirement a legitimate one...." The court added that the possibility of giving the applicant alternative tasks which do not involve contact with customers, employees, or suppliers was examined, but found to be non-implementable in practice [23].
Requiring employees to present a Green Pass as a condition for entering their workplaces is, in our opinion, only proportionate if the following conditions are met: First, employees are given the alternative option of undergoing a PCR or a rapid antigen test every few days; Second, the Green Pass is only required where it is necessary for safe business or venue activity. A Green Pass is a legitimate precondition for safe business activity when it is not possible to maintain sufficient physical distance

from other employees or customers in the workplace. This is all the more relevant when we relate to work involving at-risk populations: children--who cannot be presently vaccinated, patients, and the elderly, who may suffer from immunodeficiency. The third condition is that measures against an employee shall begin with the least infringing option (such as a change in position or a requirement to work from home) and will only proceed to unpaid leave or dismissal when less intrusive measures are impossible to apply.
With that said, priority should be given to measures taken by the workplace to ensure that the vaccine is accessible to employees. Such measures include providing the opportunity to be vaccinated during work hours, the granting of symbolic benefits to vaccinees, or coordinating the arrival of mobile vaccination units to the workplace. Such measures would promote a safe working environment and express support for the vaccine efforts that would contribute to society as a whole.
Fairness in Green Pass eligibility criteria Regardless of the vaccine purchase agreements between the Israeli Ministry of Health and Pfizer Inc. and alongside them, the Israeli Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) has also been developing a vaccine produced by using the genetically-modified virus method. This differs from the mRNA method employed by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines which have received FDA approval. The development of the IIBR vaccine is currently in Phase 2 of its clinical trials, and aims for about 1,000 volunteer participants, some of whom shall be assigned to a placebo group [24].
This, in turn, has raised the question of whether it is appropriate to issue a Green Pass to individuals recovering from COVID-19 or to individuals who have been vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine as well as to the volunteers who are participating in the IIBR vaccine trial. Answering this question requires the consideration of two issues: the vaccine developed by the IIBR has yet to prove its effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 morbidity, mortality and infection, and the fact that some of the vaccine trial participants were given a placebo and are definitely unvaccinated. On the other hand, not recognizing the IIBR trial participants as eligible for a Green Pass might be detrimental to the trial due to the withdrawal of participants, which had already taken place a week after the Green Pass program began.
On March 6, 2021, a parliamentary decision granted the Green Pass to trial participants who were given the IIBR vaccine alongside individuals vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine or individuals who had recovered from COVID-19. Trial participants who were given placebo or

low doses of the IIBR vaccine were informed that they are entitled to receive the Pfizer vaccine [25].
We believe this decision is ethically and morally justified. Not granting trial participants the right to a Green Pass would mean negatively rewarding them for stepping up and taking a risk for the sake of the communal goal of vaccine development, and thus endangers that same goal. At the same time, allowing several hundred IIBR trial volunteers to enjoy the advantages of a Green Pass would exert a minuscule impact on public health, and would Acknowledge their efforts and contribution.
Concluding thoughts The implementation of a COVID-19 Green Pass program is an imperative that would minimize infringements on the rights to movement, gathering and employment among eligible individuals and allow for the recovery and maintenance of the economic, educational and cultural spheres of activity that are essential for the common good.
Learning from the Israeli experience, we stress the need to integrate ethical values into the Green Pass's framework, while advancing and maintaining its effectiveness in achieving the sought-after communal goals.
Implementing the Green Pass provision while safeguarding equality, proportionality, and fairness may imbue this measure with ethical legitimacy despite involving a potential breach of trust and solidarity.

Scientific rationale for developing potent RBD-based vaccines

targeting COVID-19

Harry Kleanthous1, Judith Maxwell Silverman 2, Karen W. Makar1, In-Kyu Yoon 3, Nicholas Jackson3  and David W. Vaughn 1

Vaccination of the global population against COVID-19 is a great scientific, logistical, and moral challenge. Despite the rapid development and authorization of several full-length Spike (S) protein vaccines, the global demand outweighs the current supply and there is a need for safe, potent, high-volume, affordable vaccines that can fill this gap, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Whether SARS-CoV-2 S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-based vaccines could fill this gap has been debated, especially with regards to its suitability to protect against emerging viral variants of concern. Given a predominance for elicitation of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target RBD following natural infection or vaccination, a key biomarker of protection, there is merit for selection of RBD as a sole vaccine immunogen. With its high-yielding production and manufacturing potential, RBD-based vaccines offer an abundance of temperature-stable doses at an affordable cost. In addition, as the RBD preferentially focuses the immune response to potent and recently recognized cross-protective determinants, this domain may be central to the development of future pan-sarbecovirus vaccines. In this study, we review the data supporting the non-inferiority of RBD as a vaccine immunogen compared to full-length S-protein vaccines with respect to humoral and cellular immune responses against both the prototype pandemic SARS-CoV-2 isolate and emerging variants of concern.

INTRODUCTION
Unprecedented progress has been made in the design, development, production, and distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines to address the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVAX, a global initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines led by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, has delivered over 370 million doses to 144 countries and territories (https://www.unicef.org/supply/covid-19-vaccine-market-dashboard). Despite these remarkable achievements, there are serious challenges threatening the initial target delivery of 2 billion doses in 2021, such as raw material shortages, manufacturing delays, safety signals, the emergence of multiple viral variants of concern and interest (VOC/ VOI)1,2, and unequal procurement of vaccines by high-income countries. Ultimately, these challenges may result in a significant shortfall and delay in vaccine being made available to low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).
Most of the COVID-19 vaccines currently available or soon to be available to COVAX--including adenovirus-vectored, mRNA, and protein-subunit vaccines--use antigens based upon the SARSCoV-2 full-length Spike (S) protein. Figure 1 illustrates the S-protein in its trimeric prefusion conformation showing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on each protomer at the apex, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the conserved S2 stalk region3,4. Vaccine approaches using just the RBD region as an antigen have the advantage of focusing immunity to key protective determinants. As an immunogen, the RBD shares multiple positive attributes with the parental full-length S-protein (Table 1), as well as potential production and manufacturing advantages such as delivery of abundant5, temperature-stable6,7 vaccine doses at an affordable cost, critical factors for distributing vaccine to LMIC. Following several successful preclinical proof-of-

concept studies, RBD candidates have been advanced into clinical testing utilizing multiple vaccine platforms (Table 2). With the potential for making billions of doses of RBD vaccines available, its manufacture at single-site production facilities by experienced developing country vaccine manufacturers (DCVM) will obviate the need for numerous tech-transfers and minimize the risk of delays. This will be especially important in case there is a need to update the vaccine based on epidemiological trends, as is the case for seasonal influenza vaccines.
Available data are evaluated here from numerous preclinical and clinical studies, supporting the non-inferiority of RBD vaccine immunogens compared to full-length S-protein (Table 1), both with respect to eliciting homotypic and heterotypic crossneutralizing antibody (nAb) responses and cross-protection against emerging variants.
CLINICAL DATA SUPPORT NAB AS A BIOMARKER OF PROTECTION
Vaccine-induced immunity and efficacy are being used to help establish a correlate of protection (CoP), a measurable immune response (often nAb titer) predictive of protection, as has been demonstrated for some licensed vaccines8,9. As of October 2021, both meta-analyses and prospective case-cohort sampling analyses have found a strong correlation between nAb titers and protection against COVID-1910-13. This is underpinned by passive immunization and preclinical vaccine efficacy studies in nonhuman primates (NHPs) that similarly support nAb as a CoP14-16.
Meta-analyses of numerous clinical candidates support the correlation between vaccine efficacy and nAb titer, regardless of vaccine platform. In seeking to establish a CoP for COVID-19 vaccines, both Earle et al.11 and Khoury et al.12 initially showed only a weak relationship between efficacy and reported nAb or

binding antibody (bAb) titers11,12. This poor association could be platform used (rank correlation  = 0.79). nAb calibrated against

explained by the high variation observed between the selected HCS accounted for up to 88.4% of the variation in efficacy

assays used by different studies17,18. This variability was partially mitigated by calibrating the assays against panels of human

observed across seven different vaccine studies and suggest that any vaccine, including RBD-based vaccines, which elicit significant

convalescent sera (HCS) run within the same study. When the titers were calibrated to HCS, a strong correlation between nAb and efficacy was observed, irrespective of the specific assay

amounts of nAb, is likely to afford protection. The correlation was
further strengthened (rank correlation  = 0.86) when the analysis uncoupled the timing of the second dose and efficacy in the AstraZeneca ChAdOx trial13. A recent pre-publication investigating

direct quantitative comparison of immune correlates results from

the AZD12222 trial and the mRNA-1273 Coronavirus Efficacy (COVE) trial shows remarkably consistent results for nAb10. This

direct comparison was enabled by calibrating assays and

reporting results against the WHO International Standard17, steps

that are essential for comparing clinical immunological data and

by now should be the standard in the field19. The same pre-

publication also noted that 68.5% of vaccine efficacy was

mediated by the day 29 cID50 titer in the mRNA-1272 COVE

trial10. The totality of the data support neutralization titer as a

potential surrogate endpoint in future clinical trials of mRNA-1273.

These statistical efforts to identify a CoP for COVID-19 vaccines are

being increasingly recognized by vaccine manufacturers and

regulatory agencies. The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products

Regulatory Agency approved a pivotal Phase 3 study design to

support vaccine authorization comparing the immunogenicity of a

candidate vaccine to the immunogenicity of an approved vaccine

with clinical evidence of efficacy, using nAb as a biomarker of protection20. Additional clinical trial-specific analyses expressed in

International Units are awaited, as well as assessment of the

durability of this correlation over time and impact of

circulating VOC.

RBD IS A KEY TARGET OF NAB
During the acute phase of natural infection, there is a rapid onset of protective immunity, typified by serum IgG nAb that targets RBD21. Functional RBD-specific responses at mucosal surfaces have also been noted, with secretory IgA shown to offer potent neutralization22, highlighting a preference for both systemic and mucosal responses. Depletion experiments demonstrate that 90% or more of the neutralizing activity present in the plasma of convalescent

tion from the US Food and Drug Admisnistration on 26 May 202138. Potent mAbs to other RBD-specific sites have also been in clinical development (REGN10889 and LY-COVV555), although at least one has been shown to significantly lose potency against the VOC following evolutionary changes in the RBD.
To date, several RBD bAbs with potent neutralizing activity have
been demonstrated to be unaffected by the RBD mutations seen
in the newly circulating Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) viral variants29,39-41 (for a list of the mutations in RBD, see Table 3).

(https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/). Many mutations in RBD appear to have enhanced receptor-
binding affinity, resulting in increased infectivity and transmission. Viral variants that emerge harboring mutations in S-protein have the potential to evade nAb responses from previous infection, mAb therapies, or immunity from prior vaccination. The restricted antigenic changes observed in the SARS-COV-2 RBD support a convergent evolution theory, potentially a result of host adaptation leading to enhanced infectivity, and highlights the need for more broadly cross-neutralizing immunity49. As a result bivalent vaccine approaches targeting two or more variants are currently being explored for S-protein and RBD-based vaccines, in hopes of achieving broader coverage and protection against VOC48,50. although the utility of a bivalent vaccine formulation must be considered in the context of evolving epidemiology and additional booster shots with the prototype vaccine.

NTD: A FUNCTIONAL NEUTRALIZATION TARGET
Full S-protein vaccine antigens all contain the NTD, a second neutralization target. Several NTD-specific mAbs isolated from convalescent memory B cells, as well mAbs isolated from plasmablasts following mRNA vaccination, have demonstrated potent neutralizing capabilities against the original Wuhan-1 pandemic virus37,42. Many of these NTD-targeting mAbs are nonneutralizing and have been shown to inhibit cell-to-cell fusion, activate alternate effector functions, and have been demonstrated to be protective from SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

B-cell responses were rich in recurrent and clonally expanded antibody sequences, with 10-90% of S-protein-specific memory B cells recognizing the RBD domain51,52. These clonal memory B
cells were determined to express antibodies with evidence of
somatic hypermutation, with some having increased neutraliza-
tion potency and resistance to RBD mutations. Individuals with
even modest plasma-neutralizing activity have also been shown to
harbor rare IgG memory B cells that produce potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization Ab53. For certain antibody lineages, maturation
enabled neutralization of circulating SARS-CoV-2 VOC and heterologous sarbecoviruses54.

The NTD is a site of prevalent and recurrent deletion regions, which vary by length and location43. In addition, the currently
designated VOCs harbor multiple mutations in the NTD, suggest-
ing ongoing selective pressure, with NTD highly divergent across the different variants and other sarbecoviruses1. As such, an

Recent work has shown that vaccination is similarly able to induce robust memory. The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273) efficiently primed memory B cells specific

Due to the anticipated benefit of vaccine-induced T-cell immunity to SARS-COV-2, CD4 and CD8 T-cell epitope mapping using overlapping peptides has been performed across the full length of the S-protein. An evaluation of CD4 T-cell responses in humans reported a frequency of at least 20% focused on discrete regions of the S-protein, including the NTD, the C-terminal domain, the neighboring fusion protein region, and the RBD68,69. It was also reported that the sequences of most T-cell epitopes are unaffected by mutations in the SARS-COV-2 VOC, including the

T-cell reactivity to S-protein in vaccinees were robust against the
SARS-COV-2 variant mutations. The RBD contains fewer immunodominant CD4 T-cell epitopes
than the full-length S-protein. Despite this fact, there is ample evidence that sufficient numbers of T-cell epitopes are presented by the RBD to generate good CD4 responses and elevated levels of functionally nAb16,71. The identification of multiple common CD4 T-cell epitopes within the RBD has been independently verified using different T-cell epitope mapping approaches69,72,73. Clinical studies with RBD antigens support the assertion that sufficient T-cell help is provided following immunization (Table 2). Immunization with an mRNA-encoded
RBD vaccine candidate showed the induction of nAb titers ranging from 0.7-fold (1 g dose) to 4.6-fold (30 g dose) higher than HCS74,75. Notably, induction of robust nAb titers by RBD was not specific to the mRNA platform. A protein-subunit RBD-

PROTOTYPE RBD-NP VACCINE
The Institute for Protein Design (University of Washington) SARSCoV-2 vaccine consists of a self-assembling, two-component nanoparticle that displays 60 copies of RBD per nanoparticle26. The RBD-np (nanoparticle) is produced in mammalian cells and maintains the two functional N-linked glycosylation sites (N331 and N343), important for proper folding of protein and for antibody recognition26. A comparison of the glycosylation patterns between the RBD-np and the S-2P trimer was very similar at the two sites, both exhibiting complex glycan that were heavily fucosylated. The RBD-np candidate administered intramuscularly proved safe, was as immunogenic as a recently described next-generation prefusion S-protein trimer107, and protected mice and rhesus macaques from live virus challenge.

sequence68. Similar to CD4 epitopes, by definition, the RBD subdomain of S-protein contains fewer CD8 T-cell epitopes than the full-length S-protein. Therefore, it is not clear whether RBD would contain adequate CD8 T-cell epitopes for a vaccine whose protection was based on eliciting CD8 T cells. In this context, the broader number of epitopes in the full S-protein may be advantageous.
Due to large variations in T-cell assay methodology and resultant data, cross-study comparisons of T-cell responses are difficult, if not impossible, to interpret79,80. Full appreciation of the effect of vaccine platform and antigen on CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses will require standardized peripheral blood mononuclear cell collection and assay protocols, as was established within the COVID-19 Prevention Network and the COVE trial. Interpretable comparison of vaccine-induced cell-mediated immunity is expected within the year.

A systems biology approach for investigating significantly expressed genes among COVID19, hepatocellular carcinoma, and chronic hepatitis B
Babak Sokouti* 

Abstract
Background: Worldwide, COVID-19's death rate is about 2%, considering the incidence and mortality. However, the information on its complications in other organs, specifically the liver and its disorders, is limited in mild or severe cases. In this study, we aimed to computationally investigate the typical relationships between liver-related diseases [i.e., hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and chronic hepatitis B (CHB)] and COVID-19, considering the involved significant genes and their molecular mechanisms.
Methods: We investigated two GEO microarray datasets (GSE164805 and GSE58208) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the generated four datasets for mild/severe COVID-19, HCC, and CHB. Then, the overlapping genes among them were identified for GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, protein-protein interaction network construction, hub genes determination, and their associations with immune cell infiltration.
Results: A total of 22 significant genes (i.e., ACTB, ATM, CDC42, DHX15, EPRS, GAPDH, HIF1A, HNRNPA1, HRAS, HSP90AB1, HSPA8, IL1B, JUN, POLR2B, PTPRC, RPS27A, SFRS1, SMARCA4, SRC, TNF, UBE2I, and VEGFA) were found to play essential roles among mild/severe COVID-19 associated with HCC and CHB. Moreover, the analysis of immune cell infiltration revealed that these genes are mostly positively correlated with tumor immune and inflammatory responses.
Conclusions: In summary, the current study demonstrated that 22 identified DEGs might play an essential role in understanding the associations between the mild/severe COVID-19 patients with HCC and CHB. So, the HCC and CHB patients involved in different types of COVID-19 can benefit from immune-based targets for therapeutic interventions.

disease as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Over 620 million cases and nearly 6.6 million fatalities were recorded by October 14, 2022 (i.e., https://covid19.who.int/). Elderly patients with significant health problems, including diabetes, obesity, and chronic renal disease, suffer from worse disease and higher death rates [1, 2, 3]. There is a considerable variation in clinical presentations of COVID-19, which may be anything from shortness of breath to kidney problems [4, 5].

Some researchers are very concerned about the effects of COVID-19 and those connected to patients with hepatitis C or B or both diseases. Such issues often strike those with liver problems, especially those with liver fibrosis, damage, or cancer [6, 7]. And, as the number of SARS-CoV-2 and HBV or HCV coinfected individuals increases, so does the risk of creating an outbreak [8, 9]. To provide better care for the significant population of patients at risk for having HCV or HBV, understanding the liver symptoms and conditions of COVID-19 that these patients experience is essential.
Two worldwide viral infections need scrutiny: COVID19 and HBV. The studies have indicated that hepatitis B infection does not seem to increase one's chance of developing SARS-CoV-2. Although there are few conflicting results on the effects of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) on COVID-19 patients, we know that it may cause certain complications. COVID-19 had a greater death rate in individuals with chronic liver disease, and it needs additional investigation for confirmation [10, 11].
A recent study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 has a specific receptor on host cells, ACE2, and a strong binding capacity to the virus [2, 12, 13]. Higher expression levels in various organs seem more easily infected by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious in cancer patients, and their prognosis is bleak [14]. Additionally, patients with HCC had a decreased ACE2 expression compared to normal samples, which correlated with a poor prognosis [14]. Nevertheless, many questions remain about the role that the SARS-CoV-2 proteins play in regulating human mRNA expression in cancer.
The fact that earlier research has shown that COVID19 has a relationship to liver function in people with chronic hepatitis B has not deterred researchers from investigating its role in people with other liver disorders (e.g., CHB). Moreover, researchers published the findings on people with persistent HBV infections who had COVID-19. On the other hand, various biomarker signatures may serve as diagnostic information to enhance treatment plans for HCC and COVID-19 in specific personalized medicine.
Methods
Microarray datasets Data from the NCBI-Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, GSE164805 and GSE58208, were used in this study with a total sample size of 42. The 15 samples from GSE164805 come from five severe COVID-19 patients, five mild COVID-19 patients, and five healthy samples. There were ten individuals with HCC, twelve patients with CHB in GSE58208, and five control samples (i.e., GSE58208 has both CHB and HCC samples separately without in-common patients involved). The

control groups, who were a reference in the datasets, had no inflammation, viral genome, or HCC/CHB histories. The GSE164805 samples were run on the Agilent-085982 Arraystar human lncRNA V5 microarray (GPL26963) to produce the expression profiling arrays, whereas the GSE58208 samples were run on the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (GPL570).
Identification of DEGs By comparing patients infected with mild and severe SARS-CoV-2, CHB, and HCC and their corresponding control samples, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the GEO2R tool as well as "umap," "GEOquery," and "limma" packages [15]. Next, we selected the statistically significant DEGs (|log2(FoldChange)|0.5) with a p value of less than 0.05 and Benjamini & Hochberg (False discovery rate) criterion for p value adjustment. Last, we used the Multiple List Comparator free publicly available tool in the Web site link (i.e., http://www.molbiotools.com/) to create Venn diagrams that show the overlapped DEGs obtained for the diseases mentioned above.
GO and KEGG enrichment analyses Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the obtained significant DEGs. A major Knowledgebase upgrade, DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) v6.8, comprises a complete collection of tools to interpret the meaning of genes with powerful annotation capabilities useful for scientists [16]. The GO analysis includes a biological process (BP), molecular functions (MF), and cellular components (CC). Additionally, the KEGG pathway analysis was carried out. The threshold of p value<0.05 was used for both GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses.
Protein-protein interaction network construction and hub genes identification The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was generated, analyzed, and visualized using the Cytoscape 3.7.1 through STRING program (with default parameters) and included all the known interactions among the cell's proteins [17, 18]. We employed the Cytoscape cytoHubba plugin to investigate the associations between the DEGs, including analyzing, clustering, and identifying hub genes. Using the plugin, the "Degree" criterion was selected for hub genes identification. Finally, the 10 top essential genes were picked from the PPI network analysis that can reveal the critical hub genes.

Assessment of immune cell infiltration We utilized the TIMER (Tumour Immune Estimation Resource) database available through the R-based Web site link as a shiny app to estimate the correlations between the mRNA expression data for identified DEGs and tumor purity and the quantity of immunological infiltrates, as well as B cells, C­ D4+ T cells, ­CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. There were almost 10,000 samples from the TCGA representing 32 different kinds of cancer in this database [19, 20, 21]. All data were analyzed using the Spearman correlation technique where the categorization correlation criteria are as follows: low 0.00-0.19; moderate 0.20.03-0.39; high 0.40.04-0.59; very high 0.60.0-1.0.
Results
DEGs identification In total, 19,336, 21,774, 4294, and 4663 DEGs were extracted from the GSE164805, GSE164805, GSE58208, and GSE58208 microarray datasets, respectively. And the results indicated that 2328, 2389, 2212, and 2487 DEGs were in common among different datasets: severe COVID-19 and CHB, mild COVID-19 and HCC, mild COVID-19 and CHB, and severe COVID19 and HCC, respectively (Additional file 1: Fig S1).

Enrichment analyses of GO and KEGG The DAVID Web site was used to run the GO and KEGG pathway enrichment investigation, from which the illustrated outcomes were then shown in terms of -log10 (p value). The DEGs were grouped according to their GO analysis into MF, BP, and CC. According to the BP analysis, the shared genes between the four datasets were primarily associated with protein transport and protein autophosphorylation. In contrast, the shared genes between mild COVID-19 and CHB and HCC were associated with protein transport, positive regulation of transcription DNA-templated, and transcription DNAtemplated. Moreover, the shared genes between severe COVID-19 and CHB and HCC were related to protein phosphorylation, mRNA splicing via spliceosome, and transcription DNA template (Fig. 1). For the CC analysis, the shared DEGs among four datasets were mainly enriched in neoplasm, cytoplasm, and membrane, while the shared DEGs between mild COVID-19 and CHB as well as HCC were located in membrane and neoplasm.
Additionally, the shared genes between severe COVID19 and CHB as well as HCC were positioned at the neoplasm, nucleus, and membrane (Fig. 2). In the MF, the shared gene among four datasets was primarily enriched in protein binding and poly(A) RNA binding. At the same time, common genes between mild/severe COVID-19 and CHB as well as HCC were also increased in protein binding and poly(A) RNA binding (Fig. 3). Genes

edges), mild COVID-19 versus HCC (2292 nodes and 22,386 edges), and mild COVID-19 versus CHB (2139 nodes and 21,939 edges) was constructed. The top 10 genes were identified using the 11 techniques provided in cytoHubba and ranked using the degree method. The identified hub gene sets for severe COVID-19 versus HCC, severe COVID-19 versus CHB, mild COVID-19 versus HCC, and mild COVID-19 versus CHB are shown in Fig. 5.
Significant DEGs associated with immune cell infiltration The statistically significant existence of either negative or positive correlations between identified unique DEGs from the previous section and immune cell infiltration was comprehensively explored based on the TIMER database. The results revealed that there was closely a positive correlation between the expression of all DEGs and the infiltration of B cells, C­ D8+ T cells, C­ D4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (p<0.05). The JUN, JUN, and GAPDH expressions were not significantly correlated for infiltration of B cells, ­CD8+ T cells, and ­CD4+ T cells, respectively. Moreover, no significant correlation was identified between the expression of all DEGs and the purity. However, some of the target DEGs identified negative (i.e., ACTB, IL1B, PTPRC, SRC, TNF) and positive (HNRNPA1, VEGFA) correlations. More details are depicted in Additional file 2: Fig S2.

Discussion About 391 million persons globally are at risk of developing decompensated liver disease and hepatocellular cancer due to CHB [22]. Preexisting liver disease comorbidity may impact the results of COVID-19 in patients with chronic viral hepatitis [20]. Oncologists worldwide were affected by the COVID-19 epidemic. In this pandemic, CHB may be significant comorbidity of preexisting liver illnesses. A study suggests that HCC sufferers are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 because they have both cancer and chronic liver disease at the same time; however, there is no available clinical evidence [23]. Strengthening one's immune system via regular physical activity is linked to a better response to viral infectious illnesses like COVID-19 [24].
Identifying undesirably expressed candidate genes, which may provide insight into how a process is regulated in response to a stimulus, may be of considerable assistance in determining the appropriate therapy targets and preventive measures to take. Accordingly, in this work, bioinformatics methods were employed to examine two microarray datasets (GSE164805 and GSE58208) to find probable drivers. Using the utilized criteria, we were able to narrow down the list of candidate hub genes to 22 (ACTB, ATM, CDC42, DHX15, EPRS, GAPDH, HIF1A, HNRNPA1, HRAS, HSP90AB1, HSPA8, IL1B, JUN, POLR2B, PTPRC, RPS27A, SFRS1,

Fig.5 Correlation between the identified DEGs and immune cell infiltration (TIMER); p value<0.05 represented statistically significant

SMARCA4, SRC, TNF, UBE2I, VEGFA) that will be discussed in detail as follows.
For comparisons across species and tissues, the researchers used the ACTB gene expression data from each of their RNA-seq experiments to normalize the expression of ACE2. Most cell types produced the housekeeping gene ACTB, which was an internal control for gene expression measurements. Additionally, all species investigated have the ACTB gene [25].
TLR7-ATM deficiency may cause two distinct immunodeficiency phenotypes. The potential that the ATM deficit influenced the progression of COVID-19 in the TLR7-deficient case cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, the death of B cells due to ATM deficiency reduced germinal center frequency and size after vaccination. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who have X-linked TLR7 and ATM pathogenic mutations, along with their clinical and molecular characterizations, have also been studied elsewhere [26].
Various signaling pathways could target CDC42, which was downregulated in HCC515 cells with COL-3 treatment [27]. CDC42 could also be affected by the

Coronaviridae family neurotropic virus (i.e., porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) [28]. Additionally, CDC42 is one of the many genes downregulated in lung cells when COL-3 functions as a protective mechanism. So, such genes (CDC42) are required for a chemokine, TNF, and MAPK signaling pathways [27].
It is crucial to note that SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that is the source of the current global coronavirus epidemic [29, 30]. SARS-CoV-2 may readily infect human intestinal epithelial cells in individuals with COVID-19 who have gastrointestinal symptoms and fecal RNA excretion of the virus [31, 32]. RNA helicase DHX15 may be targeted to regulate SARS-CoV-2 and the inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract produced by SARS-CoV-2, based on the findings on its involvement in regulating enteric RNA virus-induced intestinal inflammation [33].
The mRNA vaccine vesicles must enter cells and hijack the host cell machinery to create a viral protein antigen, which will then be processed and presented by MHC molecules to stimulate B and T cell responses. All are necessary to translate mRNA, the ribosome, translation initiation factors, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases,

and elongation factors. EPRS seems to control profibrotic protein production [34].
The ACE2 mRNA transcript level was determined to be comparable to GAPDH and beta-actin. Overall, the data show that the mRNA encoding for the ACE2 gene is expressed similarly across patients. Patients with COVID-19 will need to be investigated in the future to learn more about how SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the thyroid [35].
ACE2 expression was lowered by HIF1A knockdown under hypoxic circumstances, alone or combined [36]. Patients with severe COVID-19 may also see an increase in the degradation of FOXP3 proteins because the hypoxic lung environment activates HIF1A, which is involved in aerobic glycolysis [37]. Furthermore, it was shown that overexpression of HIF1A in human embryonic kidney cells strongly decreases the production of ACE2 [38].
HNRNPA1 was downregulated in Calu-3 cells, indicating a human cell's reaction to inhibit viral replication in contrast to the prior instances of upregulated genes. Human RNA-binding proteins such as HNRNPA1, which was recently identified as the "hub protein" with the most significant functional ties to the human SARS-CoV-2 genome, were shown to have conserved connections to the SARS-CoV-2 genome in this research [39, 40].
In addition to playing a significant part in cancer development, the signaling of growth factor receptors (GFR) is also essential for the progression of some viral infections [41-43]. Recent investigations have shown that infection with SARS-CoV-2 significantly alters the expression of numerous genes involved in cellular signaling pathways essential in cancer development. One of these is the RAS-RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway [44]. Those with COVID-19 and more severe symptoms have been shown to have more significant H-Ras gene overexpression in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).
The SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers such overexpression in immune cells, a molecular process. This finding can highlight the importance of the Ras family of genes in the host immune response, not just to COVID-19 but to other viral infectious diseases as well [45].
Viruses may activate Hsps, particularly Hsp70 and Hsp90, which increase viral replication. For example, the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin inhibits coronavirus replication in cell culture systems [46]. HSP90AB1 overexpression also suggests that increased inflammation triggered extrapulmonary tissue remodeling. The estrogen signaling pathway connected with the HSP90AB1 target was identified as the primary COVID-19 signaling mechanism [47].
The HSPA8 protein involved in antigen processing and presentation was changed in six COVID-19 individuals

[48]. HSPA8 was one of the most downregulated COVID19 genes [49]. The results demonstrated that HSPA8 was connected to other genes involved with heat shock response and ER stress, suggesting that cellular stress response is vital in SARS-CoV2-related coronavirus pathogenesis [46]. Also, in SARS-CoV-2-infected NHBE cells, many interleukin genes were elevated, including IL1B [50]. SARS-CoV-2-infected NHBE cells exhibited a significant increase in lung fibrosis-related genes (e.g., IL1B). For COVID-19 individuals suffering from an inflammatory storm, an integrated analysis suggested that new target genes such as IL-1 may be beneficial [51].
Cardiac myocyte hypertrophy is linked to an increase in c-Jun expression level, according to research. As part of the activator protein-1 complex, c-Jun regulates cell death and survival [52]. Viral infections are connected with inflammation, and JUN is crucial in this process [40]. In individuals with COVID-19, C­ D4+ T cells expressed significant amounts of inflammatory genes, including JUN [53].
A topological study of the gain component was carried out, and the POLR2B gene, which was shown to have a higher network degree, was discovered [54]. The POLR2B gene was shown to be ubiquitinated, and its protein levels dropped in other studies [55]
As a critical antigen, T cell activation in atherosclerosis relies on PTPRC, previously known as CD45. Vaccination may activate nave B cells, as shown by the upregulation of many genes (such as PTPRC) implicated in GO pathways for B cell activation. Severely affected COVID-19 patients have lower levels of the PTPRC gene, indicating that activation of nave B cells may be hampered in these people [56, 57].
The housekeeping Rps27a gene encodes a 40S subunit 20 of the ribosomes. There are two protein-coding transcripts for the mouse Rps27a gene (named S27a-44 and S27a-45). It was discovered that the levels of two of the four ribosomal fusion proteins encoded by human ubiquitins, RPS27A and UBA52, were elevated in patients with Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19 with Alzheimer's disease, respectively [28, 58].
A genome-wide CRISPR investigation has identified SMARCA4 as a SARS-CoV-2-specific gene. SMARCA4 and SMAD3 may be involved in SARS-CoV-2 entrance, and virus-induced cell death is possible. The proviral activity of SMARCA4, a protein expressed by the SMAD3 gene, has been described by Wei's group [59].
However, ABL kinases are combined with SRC family kinases to enhance vaccinia virus actin-based motility. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may benefit from SRC's anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic action and cytokine inhibition. RPS3 was found to be an essential player in viral replication, while SRC non-receptor

Sokouti Egyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics (2022) 23:146

Page 8 of 11

protein kinase was found to be a hub gene in the inflammatory response. It has been observed that proteins like SRC, which control the cytokine secretion network, were crucial in the ACE2-related inflammatory responses to the cytokine secretion-associated proteins [60, 61].
In the COVID-19 cohort with Alzheimer's disease, the serine- and arginine-rich splicing factor 1 is encoded by the downregulation of SRSF1. SRSF1 activity becomes uncontrolled due to neurodegeneration-related hypoxia, resulting in increased splicing, which is then detected in Alzheimer's patients [28].
High levels of TNF- are caused, according to Tsukamoto et al. [62], by genetic changes at the TNF- locus. Increased TNF- production is linked to two biallelic polymorphisms in TNF-, one associated with severe infectious diseases [63]. Consequently, anti-TNF medicine is being considered a possible treatment for COVID19 [57]. Inflammatory cytokines like TNF and IFNg have been linked to low vitamin D levels. In contrast, vitamin D has been shown to suppress these cytokines and boost anti-inflammatory cytokines generated by macrophages [51].
UBE2I is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in protein breakdown, although it may also promote transcription [64].
Due to the removal of ACE2's antagonistic effect on VEGFA production, SARS-CoV-2 elevates levels of VEGFA in the body. Heart problems are also significantly linked to the rise in VEGFA expression, which causes cardiac hypertrophy to proceed. For example, ACE2 suppresses cell invasion and migration in NSCLC cells by suppressing VEGFA/VEGFR2/ERK pathway in breast cancer. Antagonizing VEGFA has also been caused by SARS-CoV-2 downregulation of ACE2, an essential factor. VEGFA is a crucial gene in COVID-19 cancer highrisk patients, according to a comprehensive gene-disease association analysis [52, 65, 66].
When the livers of COVID-19 patients who had passed away were examined histologically, it was discovered that there were extensive vascular abnormalities, steatosis, and mitochondrial abnormalities. These conditions were assumed to be brought on by SARS-CoV-2 [10]. According to the findings of several studies, the prognosis for patients with COVID-19 infections was poorer when the patients also had an associated chronic liver illness, which reduced the patients' liver function [66-68]. Extremely high levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) have been seen in many different kinds of cancer cells, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC), suggesting a link between COVID-19 and the progression of cancer and the mortality rate [70]. It is possible to indicate that the likelihood of direct liver damage of the HCC patient by

SARS-CoV-2 would be unlikely owing to the low expression of ACE2. Still, HCC patients with obesity are more likely to be affected by COVID-19-linked severe pathogenesis and poor prognosis [71].
Twenty percent of cirrhotic patients with COVID-19 had acute-on-chronic liver failure or acute decompensation, according to a global study that included cohorts from 13 Asian countries [69]. This is a significant result because it indicates that persons with cirrhosis are at increased risk of experiencing severe liver damage from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Patients infected with COVID19 who already have liver disease have a more significant risk of severe complications and mortality than healthy patients [72]. According to the findings of a research that included 15 patients with chronic hepatitis B and COVID-19, those patients had a more severe illness and a higher death rate when compared to patients who did not have HBV infection, which suggests that HBV coinfection may increase the development of liver damage, which is linked with unfavorable outcomes [73, 74].
Moreover, many researchers have investigated potential relationships between COVID-19 and chronic liver disease. However, the roles of these 22 genes are important while being related to the clinical manifestations.
To understand the pathophysiological and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection, one may need to have an in-depth comprehension on cytokine storm because of inappropriate recognition of the pathogen with an improper response of the immune system involving different genes and signaling pathways [75]. Furthermore, the immune response at the liver may result in immunodeficiency in patients with liver disease by distorting the liver architecture and hence disarrange the cellular organization and functions resulting in a hepatic inability to synthesize proteins. By taking into account that inflammatory cytokine signaling in the immune system and IL signaling (VEGFA, TNF, SMARCA4, IL1B, JUN, HSP90AB1, HIF1A) and B cell/T cell receptor signaling pathway (JUN, PTPRC) play important roles through the cytokine storm. As, patients with COVID-19 often have multi-organ failure, which may include liver damage due to the hypoxia and cytokine storm that accompanies SARS-CoV-2 infection [75, 76]. As also seen in COVID19, cytokine storm has the potential to be engaged in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and thrombocytopenia, both of which have the potential to aggravate the effects of DIC [77].
On the other hand, multiple signaling pathways may be involved in both diseases such as MAPK (CDC42, HRAS, HSP90AB1, HSPA8, RPS27A, SRC), PI3K-Akt-mTOR (HRAS, HSP90AB1), hypoxia (ACTB, JUN, VEGFA, HIF1A, GAPDH), JAK/STAT (PTPRC, SRC, UBE2I), and NF-kB signaling pathways (ATM, HRAS, IL1B, JUN,

Page 9 of 11

PTPRC, SFRS1, TNF) that are the key factors in these patients with hypercoagulation, infection, and inflammation [11, 78].
Last but not least, apoptosis pathway (ACTB, ATM, HSPA8, SFRS1, TNF, UBE2I), DNA damage and metabolism of RNA (CDC42, JUN, POLR2B, SMARCA4, DHX15, EPRS, HNRNPA1), and cell cycle process (ATM, POLR2B, UBE2I, VEGFA) can play roles in hepatocellular necrosis and cellular infiltration in the liver organ of patients with COVID-19, resulting in liver apoptosis [79].
Gene expression analysis has contributed to personalized medicine advancements in cancer and transplantation. This has given us a reason to apply similar methods to other diseases, such as those related to prototypical inflammatory autoimmune diseases with unknown causes. Increased understanding of disease biology, better patient care, and more tailored therapy approaches are only some of the potential benefits of gene expression profiling's clinical and translational use. Once a novel biomarker or combination of biomarkers has been discovered in fundamental research, it may take some time until they are used in clinical practice.
This is due to the time and effort needed to validate biomarkers, establish their practical efficacy, develop a manufacturing method, and get regulatory approval. When taken together, these results highlight gene expression's worth as a novel tool with the potential to provide unique data to each person [80, 81].
Conclusions A total of 22 hub genes were identified among HCC, CHB, and mild/severe COVID-19 after evaluating two GEO datasets utilizing existing methods for GO and KEGG enrichment approaches, construction of a PPI network for hub gene identification, and immune cell infiltration. These genes may have the highest potential role in signaling pathways, biological processes, cellular components, molecular functions, and immunological and inflammatory processes. Considering the outcomes obtained from the above-mentioned approach among HCC, CHB, and mild/severe COVID-19, it is vital to study the disease interconnections in-depth soon. And more immune-based therapeutic targets can be developed to cover the potential gaps specifically in terms of their molecular mechanisms among these illnesses.

CORONAVIRUS
De novo selected hACE2 mimics that integrate hotspot peptides withaptameric scaffolds forbinding tolerance ofSARS-CoV-2 variants
MinjongLee1, ByunghwaKang1, JuhwaLee2, JisunLee3,4, Sang TaekJung3,4, Chang YunSon2,5, Seung SooOh1,5* The frequent occurrence of viral variants is a critical problem in developing antiviral prophylaxis and therapy; along with stronger recognition of host cell receptors, the variants evade the immune system-based vaccines and neutralizing agents more easily. In this work, we focus on enhanced receptor binding of viral variants and demonstrate generation of receptor-mimicking synthetic reagents, capable of strongly interacting with viruses and their variants. The hotspot interaction of viruses with receptor-derived short peptides is maximized by aptamer-like scaffolds, the compact and stable architectures of which can be invitro selected from a myriad of the hotspot peptide-coupled random nucleic acids. We successfully created the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor-mimicking hybrid ligand that recruits the hACE2-derived receptor binding domain-interacting peptide to directly interact with a binding hotspot of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Experiencing affinity boosting by ~500% to Omicron, the de novo selected hACE2 mimic exhibited a great binding tolerance to all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

INTRODUCTION
For infection, many viruses specifically recognize cellular membrane proteins during their entry into host cells (1). For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as covered by thousands of spike proteins, strongly bind to human angiotensin-­ converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), a membrane receptor, leading to its internalization by membrane fusion (2, 3). To be more infectious, viruses including SARS-CoV-2 often mutate, enhancing viral transmission and immune escape over time (4, 5). Since the first report of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, many variants have emerged to date, and the five variants of concern (VOCs)--Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529)--have independently occurred on different continents (6). The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, which is attributed to the specific hACE2 recognition, has been known to include a lot of common mutations (5); in particular, some site mutations (e.g., N501Y), located in the binding hotspots, were identified to increase the binding affinity of the RBD to the targeted hACE2, thereby elevating the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (7, 8).
The frequent occurrence of variants can be a substantial problem in developing antiviral prophylaxis and therapy. To avoid viral infection, use of affinity reagents can be an effective way by blocking specific interactions between viruses and host cells; against SARS-CoV-2, a number of neutralizing affinity reagents have been developed to recognize various epitopes on the spike protein (9-12), some of which are known to partly overlap the hACE2-contacting surface. However, as escape mutations cause the structural change of the spike proteins, affinity reagents are not allowed for the specific recognition

of their binding sites, thereby leading to an inevitable decrease in neutralizing efficacy (5, 13-16). As alternatives, noncompeting affinity reagents can be administered together, and the U.S.Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the emergency use authorization of anti­ body cocktails, such as REGN-COV2, because of the rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants (17, 18). By accumulating escape mutations, however, viral variants tend to become more resistant to the mixture of potent antibodies, although their binding interaction with host cell receptors is further strengthened (19). Along with the high affinity to target viruses, the binding tolerance to their variants should not be ignored in developing effective and efficient neutralizers to fight with continually evolving, life-threatening viruses (20-22).
Inspired by the enhanced receptor recognition of viral variants, we newly demonstrate the generation of receptor-mimicking synthetic reagents capable of strongly interacting with target viruses and even their variants. We focused on a peptide motif of a host cell receptor, which heavily contributes to the binding free energy at the center of the virus-receptor interface. Without a stable yet insoluble transmembrane domain, the short hotspot peptide cannot maintain its optimal binding ability to the target virus (23-27); in this work, it was synergistically integrated with exceptionally soluble nucleic acids that can serve not only as a structural stabilizer but also as a binding cooperator. From a myriad of hotspot peptide-coupled random nucleic acids (~1014), we can readily discover the hybrid ligands by selectively isolating and amplifying aptamer-like scaffolds that maximize the hotspot interaction, which can lead to the invariable strong binding to viral variants. Using our novel in vitro selection technique, termed "hotspot-oriented ligand display (HOLD)," we successfully created the hACE2 receptor-mimicking hybrid ligand that recruits the hACE2-derived RBD-binding peptide to directly interact with a binding hotspot of SARS-CoV-2. The synergistic interplay between the hotspot peptide and the aptameric scaffold achieved comparable or more competitive binding to the RBD than the reported affinity reagents (e.g., cyclic peptides, aptamers, or neutralizing antibodies), assuring efficient blocking of SARS-CoV-2. In recognizing various SARS-CoV-2 variants, our hACE2 mimic of hotspot binding did not

alter its binding ability, and unexpectedly, its original equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd = 5.702 nM) decreased approximately by five times, thereby reserving the great binding tolerance toward all the representative VOCs: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and even the recently reported Omicron.

RESULTS
Receptor-mimicking hybrid ligand andits hotspot-oriented
invitro selection
By appropriate folding, nucleic acids can provide highly stable and water-soluble three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds that can place hot­ spot peptides in a right position and orientation to maintain their receptor-like binding properties (Fig. 1A). For the specific RBDhACE2 interaction, several hotspot peptides have been reported to be roughly 30 amino acids or less in length (28-30), but while apart from the insoluble hACE2 transmembrane receptor, the flexible motifs cannot be strongly bound to the hotspot surface of the RBD (23). It is well known that, along with negligible immunogenicity, the nucleic acids are exceptionally hydrophilic because of the polar nature of their phosphate backbones. Moreover, systematically designed iterative cycles of selection and amplification can lead to in vitro selection of unique nucleic acids (31), capable of structurally stabilizing the hACE2-derived RBD-binding peptides. Without massive and insoluble domains, the compact and highly soluble peptide stabilizers would permit high-dose intravenous administration for viral neutralization (32, 33). Moreover, the role of the nucleic acids can be further extended as a hotspot binding enhancer by cooperatively interacting with the target RBD (34, 35); centered on the monovalent peptide binding, there can be additional aptamer-like interactions, further improving the hotspot binding ability of the hACE2-mimicking hybrid ligand.
From a myriad of different nucleic acids (~1014) that are site-­ specifically linked with hotspot peptides, the peptide-supporting aptameric scaffolds can be in vitro isolated by iterative cycles of selection and amplification (Fig. 1B). Initially, the azide-tagged C terminus of peptides can be site-specifically conjugated to the 5-hexynyl end of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) library by highly efficient copper-catalyzed cycloaddition (Fig. 1B, step 1, and fig. S1), and after purification and thermal denaturation, the peptide-linked random DNA library is snap-cooled for unique 3D folding of individual ssDNAs. Upon introduction of RBD-coated magnetic beads, the RBD surfaces attract the hotspot interaction of hybrid ligand candidates, and magnetic separation allows unbound peptide-­ ­DNA conjugates to be systematically retarded (Fig. 1B, steps 2 and 3). Subsequently, the DNA domain of the bead-bound hybrid ligands can be selectively amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 5-hexynyl-modified forward primers and 5-phosphorylated reverse primers (Fig. 1B, step 4, and fig. S2A). Using lambda exonuclease digestion, we can generate 5-hexynyl-modified ssDNAs (fig. S2B), of which click reaction with the azide-tagged hotspot peptides provides the same format of hybrid library pool again for the next round of the evolutionary HOLD process (Fig. 1B, step 5).

of SARS-CoV-2 (30, 36). Within the short and consecutive chain, four amino acids (K353, G354, D355, and R357) have been confirmed to directly contact the surface of the RBD by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) observation (fig. S3) (2, 36). This hotspot region is relevant to the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs; because of the N501Y mutation of the RBD, the VOCs bind more tightly and strongly to hACE2 because the K353 of hACE2, the central amino acid of the chosen hotspot peptide, is involved in an unexpected

hydrophobic interaction with the substituted tyrosine (fig. S4) (7, 8). Moreover, this LGKGDFR peptide includes two hydrophobic and two positively charged amino acids, the nature of which cannot be offered by fully hydrophilic and negatively charged DNAs; thus, the hotspot peptide-linked random DNA library is expected to cover highly diverse electrostatic interactions in evolving the highest affinity to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (35, 37, 38).
From seven rounds of in vitro selection with gradually increased stringency (table S1), a hybrid ligand pool was successfully enriched to have a strong binding affinity to the RBD because of the synergistic effect between the hotspot peptide and the aptameric scaffold (Fig. 2A and figs. S5 and S6). From a relative binding assay, we quantitatively evaluated the RBD binding of the hotspot peptide-­ linked round 7 (R7) pool (see Materials and Methods and fig. S6). Despite the linkage of the hotspot peptide, the random DNA library displayed a significantly low level of RBD binding; when the peptide-­ linked DNA library was challenged with the RBD-coated magnetic beads, its binding fraction was only 0.38%, indicating that the hotspot peptide could not strongly bind to the RBD without a stable scaffold. In the absence of the LGKGDFR peptide, the R7 pool slightly increased RBD binding, exhibiting 5.74% binding fraction, presumably because of its own aptameric binding effect. In contrast, as the peptide-supporting R7 pool markedly improved its affinity to the RBD, its binding fraction (22.6%) became 59.37 and 3.94 times larger than that of the random DNA-peptide conjugates and the peptide-­ lacking R7 pool, respectively. Such a remarkable improvement in RBD binding would be attributed to the synergistic interplay between the hotspot peptide and the newly evolved aptameric scaffold.
Identification andcharacterization ofpeptide-supporting
aptameric scaffold
The most optimal peptide-supporting aptameric scaffold was identified from the R7 hybrid ligand pool using high-throughput sequencing and flow cytometry-based binding assay (Fig. 2B and fig. S7). When more than 4 million DNAs were sequenced from the R7 pool, the three most abundant sequence families were revealed to have high occupancy (>18%) (fig. S7A). Among the three sequence families, the most representative DNA sequences were synthesized with the 5-hexynyl group for the site-specific peptide conjugation and 3-fluorescein amidite (FAM) dye for a flow cytometry-based binding analysis (see Materials and Methods). With the 5-linked hotspot peptide, the second most abundant DNA sequence (R7-02) was the strongest in RBD binding; in the relative binding assay, the RBD-­ binding fraction of R7-02 was approximately five and eight times larger than that of R7-01 and R7-03, respectively (fig. S7B). We note that the most enriched aptamers by in vitro selection have often exhibited inferior binding ability to targets, presumably because of several plausible biases in enrichment, such as the biased amplification of PCR-favorable DNAs (39).
To serve as a hACE2 mimic, the strongest hybrid ligand, R7-02, exhibited high affinity and specificity to the RBD at the right position where hACE2 can be bound. When we quantitatively measured the Kd of R7-02, it was 5.702 nM for the RBD (Fig. 2B, green), along with negligible binding to nontargets: carboxylic magnetic beads used for the in vitro selection (black) and serum albumin as the most abundant blood protein (gray); in agreement with the relative binding assay, the Kd values of R7-01 and R7-03 were much higher than that of R7-02 (fig. S7C). From molecular docking simulation (Fig. 2C), we predicted that the high binding affinity of R7-02 to the RBD would

be attributed to the cooperative binding effect. In the energy-minimized simulation snapshot, the LGKGDFR peptide (red) is precisely positioned at the binding hotspot of original hACE2 (white) with the RBD (blue), and its binding is effectively stabilized with the conjugated aptameric scaffold (green). The DNA folding at the 3 end provides an additional binding motif to the loop structure (A475-N487) of the RBD (yellow arrow), leading to the strong and specific RBD binding of R7-02; the exact positioning of R7-02 at the interface between the RBD and hACE2 proves the potential for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization at low nanomolar concentrations in physiological body fluids.
Even in competition with previously reported RBD-binding affinity reagents, R7-02 ensured highly sustainable binding retention to the targeted surface of RBDs (Fig. 2D). To induce the RBD-binding competition, our hybrid ligand of the hotspot peptide and the aptameric scaffold was co-incubated with RBD-binding nucleic acid aptamers [CoV2-RBD-1C (40), CoV2-6C3 (41), and Aptamer-1 (12)], macrocyclic peptides [Peptide 4 (42)], or monoclonal antibodies (P05DHu and AM122), most of which are known to block the binding interface between the RBD and hACE2 (Fig. 2D, left), and for fair comparison, the Kd values of the various RBD binders were determined under the same condition for R7-02 (fig. S8). In evaluating the competitive binding (see Materials and Methods), we measured the RBD-binding fraction of R7-02 with and without its potential binding competitors, and the decrease in RBD binding was quantitatively compared with that of the other affinity reagents (Fig. 2D, right). Even after 1 hour of co-incubation with the RBD-binding aptamers or cyclic peptides, R7-02 could maintain its RBD binding, exhibiting low levels of decrease (down to 6.8%) in a ratio of competitive binding to free binding. On the other hand, the RBD binding of all other aptamers and the cyclic peptides was significantly suppressed, with up to 77.2% decrease of the ratio between competitive and free binding, indicating that the binding of the monomeric aptamers and the cyclic peptides would be relatively weak to occupy the restrictive RBD binding site against the competition with our cooperative hybrid ligand. Presumably, because of the different binding sites, negligible competition was observed between the R7-02 and the P05DHu and AM122 antibodies.
Binding tolerance ofhACE2 mimic toSARS-CoV-2 VOCs
With the great variant tolerance in binding, our hotspot peptide-­ supporting aptameric scaffold was confirmed to strongly bind all the reported VOCs of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3). Although it was initially evolved to bind the wild-type RBD through our HOLD process, the binding ability of the hybrid ligand was not undermined to recognize the highly mutated RBDs of the VOCs (Fig. 3A), as attributed to the systemic architecture that strongly interacts with the hotspot interface of the RBD.The VOCs have been revealed to improve their binding to hACE2 receptors and transmissibility into host cells by having several key mutations, including N501Y, which is highly interactive with the lysine of the LGKGDFR peptide in the hybrid ligand. When we quantitatively evaluated the binding of R702 to the five different VOCs, the Kd values of R7-02 (5.486, 3.376, 1.614, 2.757, and 1.209 nM for Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, respectively) were unexpectedly lower than that for the wild-type RBD (5.702 nM), validating the binding tolerance of R702 to all the variants (Fig. 3B). Omicron, having the most abundant RBD mutations, was the most strongly recognized by R7-02, while many different types of chosen RBD binders (Aptamer-1, Peptide 4, P05DHu, and AM122) lost their RBD binding abilities owing to the

(B) Affinity and specificity characterization of R7-02 as the strongest RBD binder.

When incubated with three different types of beads, RBD- and serum albumin-coated beads (green and gray, respectively) and bare beads (black), R7-02 exhibited a Kd of 5.702 nM for the RBD, but its negligible binding was observed to the serum albumin and the bare beads.

heavy mutations (Fig. 3C and fig. S9). This observation confirmed that the binding tolerance of R7-02 to the SARS-CoV-2 VOCs would be unique, and it is supposed that the hotspot peptide-oriented RBD binding could be significantly influenced by the mechanism of the improved hACE2 recognition by SARS-COV-2 VOCs.
Inhibition ofRBD-hACE2 interaction andneutralization ofpseudotyped SARS-CoV-2
Because of the strong binding to the RBD, the hotspot peptide-­ supporting aptameric scaffold efficiently inhibited the interaction between the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and the hACE2 receptor even at nanomolar concentrations. For characterization of inhibition efficiency, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) while varying the concentrations of R7-02 from 1 pM to 1 M (see

Materials and Methods), and R7-02 exhibited a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 138.9 nM for the RBD-hACE2 binding inhibition (Fig. 4A). The RBD inhibition of R7-02 was guided by the synergistic effect of the systematically combined hotspot peptide and the in vitro evolved aptameric scaffold; the individual components of R7-02, the LGKGDFR peptide and the aptameric scaffold, only showed 11.69 and 26.82% inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction at their concentrations of 3 M, respectively, whereas the full structure of R7-02 succeeded in 89.60% inhibition. Compared to the random DNA library (3.77% in inhibition), the DNA scaffold alone exhibited a better inhibition efficiency, as evidence of its aptameric behavior (Fig. 4B). Previously, several RBD-binding affinity reagents failed to effectively inhibit the RBD-hACE2 interaction because they could not block the exact hACE2-contacting residues on the RBD

surface (43). In contrast, the hotspot-oriented RBD binding of R7-02 proved the efficient inhibition of the RBD in hACE2 binding, posing a great potential for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.
Encouraged by superior RBD binding and blocking, the hotspot peptide-supporting aptameric scaffold was further investigated with respect to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. For the neutralization assay, we prepared the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, ex­ pressing both SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and green fluorescent

proteins (GFPs), but lacking the function of self-replication (44); by measuring the fluorescence intensity of GFPs, which are only expressed in infected cells by the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, the neutralizing efficiency of R7-02 could be analyzed fluorescently (Fig. 4C). Briefly, hACE2-overexpressing human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cell lines (hACE2-293T) were preseeded into microplates overnight and subsequently challenged with the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 (0.5 multiplicity of infection) for 6 hours for viral infection (see Materials and Methods).

level of their RBD binding, causing their infection rates to be down to 22.0 and 12.6%, respectively. Notably, R7-02, the hotspot peptide-­ supporting aptameric scaffold, most efficiently hindered the infection of hACE2-293T with the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, as evidenced by negligible green fluorescence (Fig. 4D) and a low percentage (1.9%) of infected cells (Fig. 4E). Even when compared to viral neutralization of many different RBD binders, that of R7-02 was revealed to be superior or comparable (fig. S10), and it should be considered that, unlike the most commonly used neutralizing antibodies, our hybrid ligands are fully synthetic and have a low molecular weight
(20 kDa), which is about 1/10of that of monoclonal antibodies, but they ensure efficient infection inhibition. Furthermore, with no further modification, the chimeric structure of the peptide-aptamer hybrid ligand displayed decent nuclease resistance and serum stability, comparable to those of well-known oligonucleotide modifications (e.g., phosphorothioate backbone, and 2-O-methyl and 2-F modifications) (fig. S12), posing a great potential for SARSCoV-2 neutralizers.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate the novel HOLD technique capable of generating hybrid ligands that synergistically integrate receptor-­ derived hotspot peptides with cooperatively evolved aptameric scaffolds. Original transmembrane receptors have critical drawbacks as viral neutralizers; the lipophilic membrane proteins are insoluble and could not be readily administered in our bodies (11), and their mas­ sive size can cause steric hindrance in covering the surface of viruses, such as coronaviruses with high-density surficial spike proteins (45). On the other hand, highly soluble and modifiable nucleic acids with no immunogenicity have been FDA-approved for intravenous drugs (33, 46), and the molecular weight of R7-02, the strongest RBD-binding hybrid ligand with the improved nuclease resistance, is just 20 kDa, which is roughly 18% of native hACE2 receptors. Moreover, in choosing the hotspot peptide from hACE2, we intentionally included positively charged and hydrophobic amino acids, i.e., lysine and arginine for the positive charges and leucine and phenylalanine for hydrophobic interactions, to expand the chemical and structural diversity of ligand candidates, which are mainly constituted by hydrophilic and negatively charged nucleic acids. To maximize the synergy of the two biopolymers, peptides and nucleic acids, the evolutionary HOLD process was important for de novo selection of hACE2-mimicking hybrid ligands. As the hotspot interaction with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 was conserved and even promoted by our hotspot peptide-supporting aptameric scaffold, R7-02 strongly bound to all kinds of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs with binding tolerance, even boosting the affinity by ~500% to Omicron, currently the most mutated, transmissible, and dom­ i­nant VOC.
Including receptor-like peptides, many kinds of functional peptides and their derivatives have been developed to date, and their synergistic fusion with aptameric scaffolds would be significantly advantageous for many different fields (e.g., drug discovery and delivery, biosensing, and even synthetic biology). For example, despite the presence of various potent peptide drugs, such as insulin, exenatide, and cyclosporine, the relatively low affinity and selectivity to targets have always been a critical issue, which could be well addressed by affinity and selectivity boosting of synergistically combined aptameric scaffolds. Compared to other strategies enabling structural stabilization of peptide drugs (e.g., cyclization by adopting disulfide

or thioether bonds, introduction of noncanonical amino acids, and sequence alteration) (47), our HOLD technique would provide the most tailored scaffold of certain peptides, not by the complicated rational design, but by the systematic selection process from more than 1014 candidates. The aptameric scaffold-driven cooperative binding would be an unrivaled way to maximize the affinity and selectivity of the resulting conjugate, markedly improving the potency and pharmacokinetics of the paired peptide drug. Similarly, the creation of biomarker-targeting peptide-aptamer hybrid ligands would also be highly valuable for targeted drug delivery and early diagnostics, allowing reproducible and scalable chemical synthesis and modification. Moreover, as different modalities can be readily included in the nucleic acid-based scaffold, the peptide-aptamer hybrid ligands could be programmed to perform elaborate actions, such as structure switching (48, 49), catalytic reactions (50), target colocalization (51), for biosensing, cell signaling, and even synthetic biology applications.
As exemplified by the hACE2-mimicking hybrid ligands, many different receptor mimics could be readily created through our iterative HOLD process when we systematically combine the rational choice of hotspot peptide motif with the in vitro selection of aptameric scaffolds. Recently, protein crystallography is rapidly progressing because of the advance of high-throughput crystallization screening and spectroscopic observation by cryo-EM, thereby allowing newly emerging viruses to be structurally analyzed for hotspot identification just within a month (52, 53). Moreover, by simply correlating the genotype with the phenotype, nucleic acid-based evolutionary techniques are continuously accelerated to discover a variety of functional oligonucleotides, including aptamers (54) and nucleozymes (55), in high throughput; by automatic screening (56), machine learning-guided selection (57), and multiparallel characterization (58), the in vitro evolution of nucleic acids has been substantially boosted to be completed even in a week (57). Furthermore, the peptides and the nucleic acids are chemically synthesizable, ensuring the mass production of peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates with a minimum batch-to-batch variation. Given the technical advances, our HOLD technique is envisioned to easily and quickly create receptor-mimicking hybrid ligands, especially for next-generation viral neutralizers, capable of rapidly coping with potential pandemic situations, regardless of continuously occurring unknown and lethal mutations of infectious viruses.

(Korea). Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10×), 8 M urea solution, 10× Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE), and nuclease-free water were obtained from T&I (Korea). PBSMT (1×) was used as a binding buffer [consisted of 1× PBS (pH 7.4) containing 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.02% Tween 20 (v/v)]. SARS-CoV-2 RBDs of wild type, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2) were expressed and purified as described in Supplementary Text. SARS-CoV-2 RBD of Omicron (B.1.1.529) was obtained from Abbexa (United Kingdom). Alexa Fluor 488-labeled monoclonal RBD-binding antibody (P05DHu) and Alexa Fluor 488 microscale protein labeling kit were obtained from Invitrogen. Monoclonal RBD-binding antibody (AM122) was obtained from ACROBiosystems. Macrocyclic peptide (Peptide 4) with N-terminal chloroacetyl-modified d-tyrosine was linearly synthesized by Peptron (Korea). One milligram of the linear Peptide 4 was cyclized by dissolving in 86 l of DMSO with 3 l of N,N-­ diisopropylethylamine and incubated in 60°C for 24 hours.
Site-specific conjugation between azide-tagged hotspot
peptide andhexynyl-modified ssDNA
For highly efficient copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition, 1 l of 50 mM copper(II) sulfate in water and 1.67 l of 150 mM THPTA in water were premixed 10 min before the conjugation. Three microliters of DMSO, 1 l of 10× PBS, 3 l of 0.1 mM hexynyl-modified ssDNA in water, 1 l of 2.5 mM azide-tagged LGKGDFR peptide, 2.67 l of premix [copper(II) sulfate and THPTA], and 1 l of 500 mM sodium ascorbate solution in water (to be freshly prepared) were added in order and completely mixed. The solution was shaken at room temperature overnight and purified by ethanol precipitation.
Confirmation ofthepeptide-ssDNA conjugated
hybrid library
The formation of peptide-ssDNA conjugates was fluorescently verified by coupling FITC-modified azide-tagged LGKGDFR peptide. One microliter of the reacted products (~50 ng), 7 l of 8 M urea solution, and 1 l of 6× loading dye were mixed and heat-denatured at 95°C for 10 min. The denatured products were analyzed via electrophoresis on a 10% urea polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE buffer at 300 V for 40 min and imaged by Azure C600 (Azure Biosystems). The same amount of unconjugated hexynyl-modified ssDNA library was stained with 10,000× SYBR gold staining dye (Invitrogen) and imaged in parallel (fig. S1).

MATERIALS ANDMETHODS
Materials
DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized, modified, and purified by Bioneer (Korea). The sequence of all the oligonucleotides used in this study is listed in table S2. C-terminal (4-azidobutanoyl(lysine))-­ tagged LGKGDFR peptides [with and without N-terminal fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) modification] were synthesized and purified by Peptron (Korea). 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), 1 M magnesium chloride solution, hACE2, bovine serum albumin (BSA), high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Tween 20, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), tris(3-hydroxypropyl-­ triazolylmethyl)amine (THPTA), and copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. l-Ascorbic acid sodium salt was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Lambda exonuclease enzyme and 10× lambda exonuclease buffer were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Tris-HCl (1 M, pH 7.4) was obtained from Bioneer

HOLD process
A hybrid random library was heat-denatured at 95°C for 10 min and then snap-cooled in ice to ensure the formation of the most stable 3D structures. This heat-treated hybrid library was then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with the RBD-coated beads (table S1 for selection parameters) with gentle rotation. In preparing the RBD-coated beads, target RBD was immobilized onto the Dynabeads M-270 carboxylic acids (Invitrogen) through the EDCNHS coupling process using the manufacturer's protocol, followed by quantification with the NanoOrange Protein Quantitation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After the incubation, the magnetic beads were thoroughly washed with 1× PBSMT to eliminate unbound hybrid molecules (table S1 for washing conditions), and magnetic bead-bound hybrid ligands were selectively isolated using a DynaMag-2 magnet (Invitrogen). Only the DNA domain of the isolated hybrid ligand candidates was PCR-amplified with the 5-hexynyl-modified forward primer and 5-phosphorylated reverse

primer (table S2). At every round of PCR, the optimal PCR cycle number was decided by the pilot PCR process. The PCR-amplified double-stranded DNAs (dsDNAs) were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) and then digested with lambda exonuclease to generate hexynyl-modified ssDNA pools for the next round of HOLD.The ssDNAs were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and quantified by ultraviolet-­ visible (UV-vis) measurement at 260 nm. To provide the same format of hybrid library pool for every round of HOLD, the click reaction between the azide-tagged LGKGDFR peptide and the purified hexynyl-­ modified ssDNA pool was repeated for every round of HOLD.
Volume dilution challenge forahighly stringent
condition ofHOLD
The volume dilution challenge technique is used for the highly efficient removal of unbound hybrid molecules (59). After 1 hour of incubation and subsequent washing of bead-bound hybrid library, they were immediately diluted into the increased volume (100 to 500×) of 1× PBSMT and incubated for an additional 30 min to remove hybrid mole­ cules that were easily detached in this process due to the high dissociation constant (koff) value. After the volume dilution challenge, the beads were collected and washed three times with 200 l of 1× PBSMT.
DNA domain amplification toenrich high-affinity
hybrid ligand
The 100-l PCR reaction mixture contained 5 U of Taq polymerase (T&I, Korea), 0.5 l of 0.1 mM 5-hexynyl-modified forward primers and 5-phosphorylated reverse primers, 8 l of 10 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate (T&I, Korea), 2 l of 10× PCR buffer (T&I, Korea), 10 l of collected hybrid ligands, and additional nuclease-free water (up to 100 l). The PCR reaction mixture was predenatured at 95°C for 600 s, followed by repeated cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 95°C, 30 s of annealing at 51°C, and 60 s of extension at 72°C.Five microliters of PCR mixture was collected and resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gel to determine the optimal PCR amplification cycle number with minimal by-products (pilot PCR). DNA domains of the collected hybrid ligands from every round of HOLD were PCR-­ amplified at the optimized cycle number.
ssDNA generation
After the PCR amplification, hexynyl-modified dsDNAs were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN), and 2.5 g of the purified dsDNA was digested with 5 U of lambda exonuclease (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 50 l. After incubating the mixture for 10 min at 37°C and 10 min at 80°C, the hexynyl-modified ssDNAs were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and quantified by UV-vis measurement at 260 nm.
Relative binding assay forR7 pool
After seven rounds of HOLD, we compared the relative binding capability of the populated hybrid ligand pool. The same amount of random DNA library coupled with the hotspot peptide, R7 ssDNA pool without the hotspot peptide, and R7 ssDNA pool coupled with the hotspot peptide were heat-denatured at 95°C for 10 min and then snap-cooled in ice. After heat denaturation, they were challenged with RBD-coated magnetic beads for 1 hour at room temperature and subsequently washed three times with 1× PBSMT.The amount of RBD binding was analyzed by quantitative PCR (LightCycler 480, Roche). Each PCR reaction contained 10 l of LightCycler 480 SYBR

green I master (Roche), 0.1 l of 0.1 mM forward primers and reverse primers, 2 l of RBD-bound ligands, and 7 l of nuclease-free water. On the basis of the standard curve we have previously obtained, the threshold cycles were extrapolated to the quantities of RBD-­ bound ligands (fig. S6).
High-throughput sequencing
After seven rounds of selection, the enriched pool was PCR-amplified with forward and reverse primers that includes adaptor sequences (table S2), and an optimized PCR cycle number was determined by pilot PCR.These PCR products were purified using a gel extraction kit (QIAGEN) and subsequently sequenced with Illumina MiSeq Next-Generation Sequencing at the SYSGENLAB (Korea). Sequencing library was analyzed in 101-base pair PE (paired-end) sequencing mode on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. The sequencing reads quality was measured by FastQC tool, and the adapter sequences were removed by cutadapt trimmer with the -e 0.1 -j 20 option. Only perfectly matched-paired reads were used for further analysis. The high-quality sequencing reads passed the fastq_quality_filter (Q30) from the FASTX toolkit (RRID:SCR_005534).
Affinity andspecificity analysis ofthehybrid ligand
To assess the binding affinity of the hybrid ligand toward the wildtype RBD and its variants, the DNA sequence of R7-02 was synthesized with the 5-hexynyl group for hotspot peptide conjugation and 3-FAM for flow cytometry-based binding analysis. The FAM-labeled R7-02 in 1× PBSMT was heat-denatured and snap-cooled as explained above. After heat denaturation, varying concentrations of R7-02 were challenged with RBD-coated beads for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle rotation. The beads were washed twice with 1× PBSMT to rule out nonspecific binding, and bead-bound R7-02 was then collected using a DynaMag-2 magnet (Invitrogen). The collected beads were resuspended in 1× PBSMT and analyzed by measuring the mean fluorescence of beads using CytoFLEX S (Beckman Coulter). For each measurement, 15,000 events were analyzed. Last, Kd was calculated using nonlinear regression analysis (Prism software, GraphPad Prism version 9.3.1). To assure their binding specificity, a similar characterization process was conducted for the beads coated with BSA and non­coated beads (bare beads) in parallel. In preparing the noncoated beads, Dynabeads M-270 carboxylic acid beads were tris-blocked for 15 min in 50 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature. Similar characterization processes were conducted for highly populated sequence families (R7-01 and R7-03) and the reported RBD-­binding affinity reagents: Aptamer-1, CoV2-RBD-1C, CoV2-6C3, Peptide 4, P05DHu, and AM122 (figs. S7 and S8).
Molecular docking simulation ofR7-02 incomplex withRBD
To rationalize the high binding affinity of R7-02 to RBD, the molecular structure of R7-02 in complex with the RBD was constructed using molecular docking simulation. The crystal structure of the hACE2-­ derived hotspot peptide, LGKGDFR, and the single RBD of SARSCoV-2 spike protein were obtained from the Research Coll­aboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank (PDB) (PDB ID: 6M0J), with a single site mutation (N501Y) of RBD.The secondary structure of the aptameric scaffold in R7-02 (table S2) was predicted using the mfold web server, which was fed into the RNAComposer for 3D construction. The peptide-aptamer hybrid structure of R7-02 was eventually constructed by attaching a triazole-modified linker residue between the hexynyl-modified 5 end of the folded DNA

and the butanamide-modified lysine C terminus of the hotspot peptide. Molecular docking simulation was subsequently performed to find the best fit of the hotspot peptide-bound aptameric scaffold to the RBD, while constraining the hotspot peptide and the RBD in their crystal position. The resulting structure was energy-­minimized using the AMBER14 force field, using a molecular dynamics simulation package OpenMM version 7.4.

Cell culture andsample preparation
The hACE2-293T cell line was obtained from Takara (Japan). hACE2-293T cells were cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2 atmosphere, with high-glucose DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 1% sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich). Five to 15 passages of hACE2-293T were used for the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay.

Competitive binding assay withreported RBD-binding
affinity reagents
For the competitive binding assay, R7-02 and the reported RBD-­ binding aptamers were modified with FAM and tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA), respectively (table S2). After heat denaturation and snap-­ cooling as explained above, they were co-incubated with 5 nM RBD beads (final volume: 100 l) for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle rotation. The beads were washed three times and resuspended in 100 l of 1× PBSMT to be analyzed by CytoFLEX S (Beckman Coulter) after signal compensation. The competitive RBD-binding fraction was calculated by the ratio of the mean fluorescence intensity with competition to the mean fluorescence intensity without competition (free binding). For the competitive binding with the reported RBD-­binding cyclic peptide and antibodies, TAMRA-modified R7-02 is co-incubated with FAM-modified peptide or Alexa Fluor 488-modified RBD antibodies and analyzed in the same method.
Binding fraction comparison between thewild-type
andtheOmicron RBD
To analyze the binding tolerance to the SARS-CoV-2 variants among the chosen RBD binders (Aptamer-1, Peptide 4, P05DHu, and AM122), we quantitatively measured the binding fractions for the wild-type and the Omicron RBD at 10 nM R7-02 and the antibodies (P05DHu and AM122) and at 100 nM aptamer (Aptamer-1) and the cyclic peptide (Peptide 4). After 1 hour of incubation of RBD-coated magnetic beads with each binder at room temperature with gentle rotation, the beads were washed three times and resuspended in 100 l of 1× PBSMT.The binding fractions of each binder to the wild-type and the Omicron RBD were directly measured by CytoFLEX S (Beckman Coulter).
ELISA-based RBD-hACE2 binding inhibition test
In characterizing the inhibition efficiency, a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor screening kit (ACROBiosystems) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. The microplate has been precoated with hACE2, and the varying concentrations of R7-02 (1 pM to 1 M) were added to the plate followed by the immediate addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated SARS-CoV-2 wild-type RBD.After 1 hour of incubation at room temperature, the wells were washed three times, and substrates were added to quantify the RBD-hACE2 binding. The reaction was terminated by the addition of the stop solution, and the intensity of absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Tecan). The IC50 value for the R7-02-driven inhibition of the RBD-hACE2 binding was determined after log transformation of hybrid ligand concentrations using sigmoidal dose-r­ esponse nonlinear regression analysis (Prism software, GraphPad Prism version 9.3.1). In the same way, the RBD-hACE2 inhibition was compared after adding 3 M individual ligands (LGKGDFR peptide, DNA domain of R7-02, and R7-02) to analyze the synergistic interplay between the hotspot peptide and the aptameric scaffold in inhibiting the RBD-hACE2 interaction.

Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay
To determine the neutralization ability of R7-02, the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay was performed. The hACE2293T cells (~4 × 103) were preseeded into 96-well plates and cultured overnight. After 24 hours, 5 l of GFP-reporting pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 (4 × 105 transducing unit/ml; BPS Bioscience) was preincubated with 3 M R7-02 in 1× PBSM (1× PBS with 2.5 mM magnesium) for 30 min at room temperature. The cell culture medium in preseeded hACE2-293T cells was removed, and the cells were washed twice with prewarmed 1× PBSM.After washing, the mixture of pseudovirus and R7-02 was added to the cells and infected at 37°C for 6 hours. After the infection, the 1× PBSM was replaced with fresh cell culture medium, and the cells were further cultured at 37°C for another 48 hours. Last, GFP fluorescence images and the bright-field images were observed using confocal microscopy (Leica DMi8; source wavelength: 488 nm). The percentage of GFP-expressing infected cells over the total hACE2-293T cells was computationally analyzed by CellProfiler version 4.2.1 (Fig. 4E and fig. S11). In the same way, the neutralizing efficacy of other RBD-binding ligands (Aptamer-1, CoV2-RBD-1C, CoV2-6C3, P05DHu, AM122, and Peptide 4) was analyzed.
Serum stability test
To characterize serum stability, we allowed nucleases to degrade the FAM-labeled R7-02 for up to 24 hours in 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C.For comparison, R7-02 with other modifications, such as the introduction of phosphorothioate backbones and 2-O-methyl and 2-F modification (see details in table S2), and other unmodified ssDNAs were tested together. Four microliters of 10 M samples was mixed with 10× PBS (4 l), fetal bovine serum (4 l), and nuclease-­ free water (28 l). After 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 8, 18, and 24 hours of incubation at 37°C, 5 l of each aliquot from the different mixtures was immediately treated in 90°C for 5 min and stored in ice before analysis. The aliquots were analyzed via electrophoresis on a 10% urea polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE buffer and imaged by Azure C600 (Azure Biosystems) after staining with 10,000× SYBR gold staining dye (Invitrogen).

SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination induces robust humoral and cellular immunity in the circulation; however, it is currently unknown whether it elicits effective immune responses in the respiratory tract, particularly against variants of concern (VOCs), including Omicron. We compared the SARS-CoV-2 S-specific total and neutralizing antibody responses, and B and T cell immunity, in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and blood of COVID-19 vaccinated individuals and hospitalized patients. Vaccinated individuals had significantly lower levels of neutralizing antibody against D614G, Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron BA.1.1 in the BAL compared to COVID-19 convalescents, despite robust S-specific antibody responses in the blood. Furthermore, mRNA vaccination induced circulating S-specific B and T cell immunity, but in contrast to COVID-19 convalescents, these responses were absent in the BAL of vaccinated individuals. Using a mouse immunization model, we demonstrated that systemic mRNA vaccination alone induced weak respiratory mucosal neutralizing antibody responses, especially against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1.1 in mice; however, a combination of systemic mRNA vaccination plus mucosal adenovirus-S immunization induced strong neutralizing antibody responses, not only against the ancestral virus but also the Omicron BA.1.1 variant. Together, our study supports the contention that the current COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against severe disease development, likely through recruiting circulating B and T cell responses during reinfection, but offer limited protection against breakthrough infection, especially by Omicron sublineage. Hence, mucosal booster vaccination is needed to establish robust sterilizing immunity in the respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2, including infection by Omicron sublineage and future VOCs.

INTRODUCTION The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health
crisis, and vaccination is considered the key to ending the pandemic (1, 2). It is well recognized that current SARS-CoV2 vaccines, particularly mRNA-based vaccination, can induce robust humoral and cellular immunity and prevent severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (3); however, protection against asymptomatic to mild infection and transmission, particularly following SARS-CoV-2 VOCs exposure, by mRNA vaccination is rather limited (4, 5). The reasons for this are

poorly defined. Notably, most of the previous studies were conducted us-
ing blood to determine circulating antibodies and B and T cell immunity following vaccination (6). However, SARS-CoV2 enters the host predominantly through the respiratory tract. As the result, respiratory mucosal antibodies, tissueresident memory T (TRM) and B cells are likely among the early responders during viral entry, and so they are believed to be essential for the protection against the establishment of viral infection after vaccination or prior viral exposure (7).

Thus, we reasoned that it was critical to characterize respiratory mucosal humoral and cellular immunity following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination or natural infection to better understand the vaccine- or infection-mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sublineage, easily escapes both vaccine and infection-elicited antibody neutralization in the blood (8-14). It is currently unclear whether efficient mucosal neutralizing antibody responses can be induced by vaccination, and/or natural infection, and to what extent this could protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Previous studies have examined the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine induced humoral and cellular immunity in the nasal mucosa (15, 16). However, it is still controversial whether intramuscular mRNA immunization can induce meaningful neutralizing antibodies and tissue-resident T and B cells in the nasal tissue (17, 18), potentially in part due to the limited amount of fluids/cells that can be sampled in nasal washes or nasal swabs. Thus, the current understanding on the COVID19 vaccine-induced mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract remains largely elusive.
Here, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and blood of unvaccinated healthy donors, COVID-19 vaccinated individuals and recovered hospitalized patients. We examined mucosal binding and neutralizing antibodies, and tissue-resident T and B cell responses in those subjects. Additionally, using a mouse model, we compared the mucosal immunity induced by homogeneous intramuscular mRNA vaccination versus intramuscular mRNA vaccination plus intranasal adenovirus vector booster immunization. Our results demonstrated that robust mucosal humoral and cellular immune responses were elicited in the lung by natural infection and mRNA vaccination plus adenovirus-mediated vaccination, but not by the mRNA vaccination alone.
RESULTS Characterization of respiratory mucosal antibody
responses following vaccination or natural infection To determine the humoral and cellular immune responses
following COVID-19 vaccination, we collected blood and BAL samples from 19 COVID-19-vaccinated individuals (Fig. 1A). Most of these individuals had received two doses of mRNA vaccination, with 3 individuals receiving the third booster and one having the J&J vaccine. The vaccine type, timing of collection, age, and sex information are included in Table. S1. We compared the vaccine-induced respiratory and circulating antibodies, as well as cellular immune responses, to those of hospitalized COVID-19 convalescent patients that we have previously recruited between September 2020 to April 2021 when the D614G and Alpha variants dominated (19). We first performed enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) to determine and compare the SARS-CoV-2 S1 or receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, IgA and IgM levels in

unvaccinated control (non-SARS-CoV-2 infected), vaccinated, and convalescent groups in the plasma. Similar to what was previously shown (3, 20), COVID-19 vaccination induced robust S1 or RBD-specific plasma IgG at levels comparable to severe cases of natural infection (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1A). The S1 or RBD-specific IgG levels in the BAL were also comparable between COVID-19-vaccinated and convalescent groups (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1B). Compared to unvaccinated donor, COVID19 convalescents exhibited moderate but detectable S1-specific IgA responses in the blood (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1C). Importantly, prior severe SARS-CoV-2 infection provoked significant levels of S1 or RBD-specific IgA in the respiratory mucosa, which was not the case for COVID-19 vaccination (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1D). The lack of notable IgA production in the respiratory mucosal appeared to contrast with the detection of moderate but significant IgA responses in the saliva following mRNA vaccination (21, 22). We also examined IgM in the blood and BAL, and observed that, while detectable levels of IgM were present in the circulation of both COVID19-vaccination group and prior infection cases, only prior infection elicited significantly elevated IgM responses in the BAL (Fig. S1E-H).
Given the existence of cross-reactive and neutralizing antibodies against non-S1 or RBD epitopes (23-25), we further examined binding antibody response against Spike protein and Nucleocapsid protein, which would have informed potential unidentified infection. COVID-19 convalescents showed significantly higher S-specific IgG, IgA and N-specific IgG, but not S-specific IgM levels in blood, compared to those of vaccinated (Fig. S1 I-L). Similar results were found in the BAL (Fig. S1 M-P). Importantly, and consistent with results of S1 or RBD-specific IgA, significant level of S-specific IgA was observed both in BAL and blood from convalescents but not vaccinated individuals (Fig. S1 M, O). Together, these results revealed that, in contrast to natural infection, COVID-19 vaccination did not provoke robust IgA responses in the respiratory tract in our cohort.
Mucosal antibody neutralizing activity against VOCs
The humoral protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on the induction of robust neutralizing antibody (26, 27). We thus examined the plasma neutralizing antibody activity against SARS-CoV-2 D614G, Delta and Omicron BA.1.1 spikepseudotyped lentiviruses. While COVID-19 vaccinated and convalescent individuals exhibited comparable high levels of circulating neutralizing antibody responses against all VOCs, the Delta and Omicron BA.1.1 variants exhibited more than 2and 10-fold decrease in neutralization titer (NT50), respectively, compared to D614G (Fig. 2 A-C and Fig. S2 A-E), consistent with recent results showing that VOCs, especially Omicron sublineage, have significant immune evasion capability (8-14, 28-30).

We next compared neutralizing antibody responses in BALs of COVID-19-vaccinated and convalescent groups along with healthy controls. Despite the overall lower neutralizing antibody levels in BAL compared to that in the blood, the convalescent group showed ~3-fold higher neutralizing antibody activity than the vaccinated group, especially for the ancestral D614G (p < 0.05) and the Delta variant (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2D, E and Fig. S2F, G). The titers for the Omicron BA.1.1 variants were mostly below the level of detection in the BAL (Fig. 2F and Fig. S2H), reflecting the stronger escape of Omicron BA.1.1 from BAL neutralizing antibodies (Fig. S2I, J). Of note, one out of three who had received a third booster vaccination exhibited above-the-threshold yet low level of neutralization activity against Omicron BA.1.1 (Fig. 2F and Fig. S2I), suggesting that third booster vaccine may offer some, but limited, levels of protection. Overall, these results indicated that natural infection elicited stronger humoral immunity in mucosal surface compared to mRNA vaccination in our cohorts.
Mucosal cellular immunity following vaccination or natural infection
Although memory T and B cells do not confer sterilizing immunity, they are important in constraining viral dissemination and protecting against severe diseases once a virus breaches neutralizing humoral immunity (31-34). Both circulating and tissue-resident memory T and B cells are believed to provide disease protection against severe respiratory viral infection (35-38).We therefore examined systemic and tissue residing memory T and B cell responses following mRNA vaccination or natural infection. Compared to unvaccinated controls, vaccinated individuals had higher RBD-specific B cells in the blood (Fig. S3 A-D). Notably, RBD-specific B cells were markedly lower in BAL compared to those of PBMCs (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3E). As reported before (38, 39), vaccination induced notable S-specific TNF or IFN- producing CD8+ or CD4+ T cells in the circulation but failed to elicit strong Sspecific cytokine-producing CD8+ or CD4+ T cell responses in the BAL (Fig. 3B, C and Fig. S4). In contrast, convalescent BAL exhibited much higher RBD-specific B cells compared to the paired blood samples (Fig. 3D), suggesting that vaccination does not induce tissue-residing memory B cell responses as effectively as natural infection. Further, BAL from COVID19 convalescents had higher cytokine-producing CD8+ and CD4 T+ cells than those of blood (Fig. 3E, F), although paired analysis was not performed here due to the availability of the samples obtained from a previous study (19). Within the total CD8+ or CD4+ T cell compartments, the levels of most memory T cell subsets in the blood and/or BAL were quite similar between unvaccinated or vaccinated individuals, except the blood central memory T cell population (Fig. S4). Thus, unlike SARS-CoV-2 natural infection, mRNA vaccination did not appear to induce significant SARS-CoV-2 specific B and T cell memory in the respiratory mucosa in contrast to

that in the blood in our cohorts. mRNA plus mucosal Ad5-S vaccination induces
strong neutralizing immunity against Omicron BA.1.1 Given the suboptimal mucosal immunity induced by the
current COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, we used a mouse model to identify potential strategies that promote and/or amplify mucosal humoral and cellular immunity after mRNA vaccination. To this end, we immunized wild type C57BL/6 mice with PBS, two doses of mRNA-encoding codon-optimized S (mRNA-S), three doses of mRNA-S, two doses of mRNA-S plus an intranasal immunization of S protein trimer with adjuvant (STING ligand, cGAMP (40)), or two doses of mRNA-S plus an intranasal of adenovirus type 5 encoding S protein (Ad5-S) (Fig. 4A). We focused on intranasal immunization in mRNA-immunized mice, in keeping the contention that induction of mucosal immunity likely occurs in previously vaccinated individuals who will be willing to receive mucosal booster vaccines. mRNA plus Ad5-S vaccination induced greatly increased BAL RBD-specific B cells (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, mRNA plus Ad5-S vaccination induced potent mucosal CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses but not in the spleen, while mRNA plus cGAMP/S trimer immunization led to robust CD4+ T cell responses in the spleen (Fig. 4C and Fig. S5). mRNA immunization, with or without the third dose of mucosal immunization, induced strong circulating S1 or RBD-specific IgG in the blood and the BAL (Fig. 4D and Fig. S6A). A third dose of mucosal immunization of S protein, with S trimer plus cGAMP or Ad5-S, resulted in significant increases of both S1 and RBD-specific IgA in the BAL (Fig. 4E), with Ad5-S inducing the highest RBD-specific IgA in the respiratory mucosa (Fig. 4E). Ad5-S also generated significantly higher levels of plasma IgA, IgM and BAL IgM than other groups (Fig. S6 B-D).
All immunized groups showed strong neutralization against D614G and the Delta variant in the plasma, although three-dose mRNA, or two-dose mRNA plus Ad5-S, vaccination induced higher levels of neutralizing antibody compared to two doses of mRNA immunization (Fig. S6E, F). As would be expected, the mouse plasma neutralization activities against Omicron BA.1.1 were also dramatically reduced relative to D614G or Delta (Fig. S6G), indicating that Omicron BA.1.1 is capable of escaping immunization-induced neutralizing antibody responses in the mouse blood similar to that in humans. However, we were still able to detect neutralizing antibody activities, at approximately similar levels, against the Omicron BA.1.1 variant in all immunized groups (Fig. S6G).
The neutralizing antibody activity in the BAL of mRNA immunized mice (two doses or three doses) were generally lower than those in the blood, but clearly detectable against D614G, with ~4-fold reduction in Delta, yet were around the limit of detection for the Omicron BA.1.1 variant (Fig. 4 F-H).

Strikingly, mRNA plus Ad5-S significantly increased the neutralization titer against the ancestral D614G by approximately 3 logs compared to other vaccination groups, and more importantly, maintained the strong neutralization activity against Delta as well as the Omicron BA.1.1 variant (Fig. 4 F-H).
To confirm that the IgA response is induced by boosting the primed response, we immunized wild type C57BL/6 mice with PBS, Ad5-S alone, or one dose mRNA-S plus Ad5-S. The S1 or RBD-specific IgA levels were generally higher in plasma from mRNA-S plus Ad5-S immunization, compared to those of Ad5-S immunization alone (Fig. S7A). Of note, mRNA plus Ad5-S immunization induced dramatically higher S1 or RBDspecific IgA level in the BAL, but not in nasal washes, compared to those of Ad5-S immunization alone (Fig. S7B, C). Furthermore, S1 or RBD- specific IgG and IgM levels were higher in plasma, BAL, as well as nasal wash after mRNA-S plus Ad5-S immunization compared to those of Ad5-S immunization alone (Fig. S7 D-I). Additionally, mRNA-S plus Ad5-S immunization induced strong antigen-specific T cell responses, particularly in the BAL (Fig. S7 J-N). Intranasal vaccination of anesthetized mice inadvertently introduces vaccine material into lower lungs (41); however, Ad5-S i.n. immunization did not appear to induce notable weight loss and provoked relatively moderate inflammatory responses in the lung compared to those of influenza infection (Fig. S8), suggesting that mucosal adenovirus delivery does not seem to lead to significant host morbidity or overt lung pathology.
Altogether, these data indicated that compared to systemic mRNA booster, the mucosal Ad5-S booster immunization elicits broadened antibody neutralization in the BAL against VOCs. Thus, we have here identified a promising immunization strategy that can induce potent mucosal neutralizing antibody effectively against the Omicron BA.1.1 variant (Fig. S9).
DISCUSSION COVID-19 mRNA vaccination elicited at least comparable
neutralizing antibody levels as COVID-19 convalescents in the circulation but generated considerably lower mucosal IgA and neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 D614G, Delta and Omicron BA.1.1 variants than those of convalescents, indicating that the overall magnitude of mucosal antibody responses is suboptimal following vaccination. Consistent with the idea, several recent large clinical studies have revealed that mRNA vaccination is relatively less efficient in the protection against infection compared to prior natural infection during the Delta wave (42-44). Of note, the Omicron BA.1.1 variant almost completely escaped the neutralization activity of BAL from either vaccinated or previously infected individuals. Additionally, we provide compelling real-world evidence that mRNA vaccination does not induce notable lung tissue-residing S-specific memory B and T cells. Thus,

despite the induction of robust circulating humoral and cellular immunity, current COVID-19 mRNA vaccines likely do not provoke sufficient levels of mucosal immunity in the human lower respiratory tract that would be needed for immediate clearance of the infectious Omicron BA.1.1 variant to prevent the establishment of infection. Such a notion is consistent with the fact that the Omicron sublineage continues to spread at a rapid pace in regions with high rates of vaccination and/or prior natural infection.
Our data do not dispute the notion that current vaccines are highly effective in preventing hospitalization and death. The prevention of severe disease after infection is conferred mainly by memory T and B cells (38, 45). To this end, CD8 T cell epitopes within Omicron Spike protein remain conserved to those of ancestral strains (46-48). Thus, even though Omicron is able to breach the defense of mucosal neutralizing antibody to cause infection, the recruitment of vaccine-induced circulating memory T cells during SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection enables protection that restrains further viral dissemination, preventing severe disease development following infection. Nevertheless, these data suggest that mucosal humoral immunity is particularly vulnerable for immune escape by Omicron BA.1.1 and other sublineage. It is thus quite likely that the current vaccine strategy, even with further boosters, will not achieve "herd immunity" or prevent the occurrence of new infections or re-infections with future VOCs, particularly those with immune-evasive properties like Omicron sublineage. Thus, our findings have significant public health implications.
Our data suggest that a mucosal SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccine may be necessary to achieve more robust immunity and protection from re-infection by future variants. To this end, we have provided a proof-of-principle experiment that systemic mRNA plus mucosal Ad5-S vaccination provoked strong cellular immunity in the respiratory tract, and compelling mucosal IgA and neutralizing activity against Omicron BA.1.1. Mucosal adenovirus delivery has concerns of safety and applicability on a large scale. However, an Ad5-S based mucosal booster strategy in vaccinated individuals has been found safe and induced stronger plasma antibody responses (49). Thus, an adenoviral booster vaccine potentially has great translational and clinical relevance. Alternatively, Emerging novel vaccine platforms like virus-like nanoparticles (50), which can provide strong adjuvant activity and prolonged antigen presentation in vivo, may also be a promising approach to boost mucosal neutralizing immunity against Omicron or future VOCs.
Compared to convalescents, BAL from vaccinated individuals had reduced neutralizing activities despite similar levels of S1 or RBD-specific IgG present in the two groups. Further, BAL from mice immunized with mRNA alone or mRNA plus S-trimer had comparable RBD-specific IgG levels to those of

mRNA plus Ad5-S immunized mice, with the latter showing markedly higher neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 ancestral virus or VOCs, indicating that BAL IgG levels alone do not perfectly correlate with the levels of neutralizing activity. Whether this is due to the strong RBD-specific IgA responses present in the respiratory mucosa following natural infection or mucosal Ad5-S booster immunization is currently unknown. Of note, prior studies have identified that viral infection can lead to persistent germinal center reaction and antibody production in the lung (51, 52). Therefore, local antigen-specific IgG or IgA produced in situ in the respiratory tract following viral infection may provide better neutralizing activities than those diffused solely from the blood following systemic immunization. In addition, persistent damage, inflammation, or chronic antigen deposition in the lung may further facilitate the development of local neutralizing antibody responses following natural infection.
Our study has several limitations. Due to the highly invasive nature of the BAL procedure, we were not able to recruit a large cohort of study participants. Furthermore, the study procedure made it challenging to time recruitment or perform a longitudinal analysis; rather it enabled a snapshot of vaccination or infection-induced mucosal immunity. Additionally, most of the participants were older and may not be representative of the entire vaccinated population, although this age group is considered as the primary targeting population for vaccination as they are at highest risk of infection associated with mortality and complications. Finally, soluble Spike trimers engaging ACE2 may trigger undesirable side effects following immunization of adenovirus-vectored vaccine (53); thus, using Spike harboring mutations known to abolish high-affinity interactions with human ACE2 shall be considered for future vaccine design.
Nevertheless, we have provided critical evidence detailing the mucosal humoral and cellular immunity following vaccination in the respiratory tract. Our study highlights the importance of focusing on vaccine-induced mucosal immunity (54) and argues for the necessity of a mucosal booster strategy in addition to the current approach of intramuscular COVID-19 vaccines.
METHODS AND MATERIALS Study design The goal of the study was to identify the respiratory mu-
cosal immune response following COVID-19 vaccination. We recruited a cohort of unvaccinated healthy individuals (n=5) and COVID-19 vaccinated individuals (n=19), most of which receiving mRNA vaccination, as well as convalescents (n=10) who were recovered from acute COVID-19 for 2 to 3 months. We obtained blood samples and BAL fluid from the study subjects. ELISA and viral neutralization assay were performed to determine SARS-CoV-2-specific binding and neutralizing antibodies in the circulation or in the respiratory

tract. Spectral flow cytometry was performed with PBMCs and BAL cells for the characterization of circulating and respiratory adaptive immune cell responses in this cohort. Lastly, we used an animal immunization model for the development of an intranasal booster strategy that can induce robust mucosal immune response in the respiratory tract, particularly against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.
Study cohorts BAL or blood samples were collected from unvaccinated donors, COVID-19 vaccinated individuals, or COVID-19 convalescents at Mayo Clinic under protocols approved by Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Boards (protocol ID 19-012187). Study participants included non-pregnant adults who were undergoing flexible bronchoscopy as part of their clinical management. However, participants who had presence of hereditary respiratory diseases (such as cystic fibrosis), clinical history of primary aspiration, neuromuscular problems, primary or secondary immune deficiencies, invasive viral or bacterial infections or a cancer diagnosis were excluded in the study. Informed consent for the use of BAL, blood and their derivatives for research was obtained from all enrolled individuals. For COVID-19 convalescents, three unvaccinated and three vaccinated samples were from a cohort that were previously recruited (19). Most of the vaccinated subjects received two doses of Pfizer/bioNTech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273) mRNA vaccination, with three individuals receiving the third booster vaccination and one individual having the J&J (Ad26.COV2.S) vaccination. All vaccinated samples were obtained within 8 months post vaccination. Full cohort and demographic information are provided in Table. S1. BAL collection Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and BAL were performed using moderate conscious sedation using standard clinical procedural guidelines in an outpatient bronchoscopy suite. Conscious sedation was administered in accordance with hospital policies, and a suitably trained registered nurse provided monitoring throughout the procedure. The bronchoscope was wedged (tip of the scope placed securely) in an airway leading a segment of the lung. About 100 to 200 mL of saline were instilled in 20-mL aliquots until 60 mL of lavage fluid was obtained. The specimen was placed on ice and immediately hand carried to laboratory for analysis. The fluid collected was placed on ice and transferred immediately to the laboratory for processing. Human single-cell purification Plasma was isolated from whole blood by centrifuging at 1,600 rpm, room temperature (RT), for 10 min. Plasma was collected and inactivated for 30 min at 56°C, then stored at -80°C for ELISA and neutralization assay. After plasma isolation, leftover blood was mixed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then gently put over on Ficoll-Paque (Cytiva,

17144002) in a 15 mL tube. Buffy coat generated by centrifuging at 400 g for 30 min at RT was collected. For single-cell purification from BAL, BAL was filtered with a 70-m cell strainer (Falcon) and then centrifuged at 350 g for 6 min at 4°C. Supernatant was collected and aliquots were stored at -80°C for ELISA and neutralization assay. Supernatant of BAL was further concentrated for 20x using 3 kDa Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit (Millpore Sigma, UFC900324) before use. The cells were collected for flow cytometry analysis.
Mice immunization and sample collection Antigens encoded by the mRNA vaccines were derived from SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank MN908947.3). Nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding the full length of the Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 with two proline mutations (mRNA-S) were synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (MegaScript, Ambion) as previously reported (55). mRNAs were formulated into lipid nanoparticles (LNP) using an ethanolic lipid mixture of ionizable cationic lipid and an aqueous buffer system as previously reported (56). Formulated mRNA-LNPs were prepared according to RNA concentrations (~1g/L) and were stored at -80°C for animal immunizations. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN, #A00002035) or the University of Virginia (Charlottesville, VA, #4369). 8- to 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Lab, 000664) were vaccinated with one dose or two doses of 1 g mRNA-S with a 21-day interval. Another 21 days later, mice were boosted with PBS, 1 g mRNA-S intramuscularly, 3 g S-trimer (Sino Biological, 40589-V08H8) adjuvanted with 10 g 2'3-cGAMP (Invivogen, tlrl-nacga23) intranasally, or 109 pfu adenovirus type 5 encoding S protein (Ad5-S) (University of Iowa Viral Vector Core) intranasally after anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine. The volume of intranasal administrations was 30 L. Three doses of PBS administered mice were used as control. 14 days later, mice were euthanatized. BAL, blood and splenocytes were collected for analysis. Isolated plasma inactivated for 30 min at 56°C, supernatant of the first 600 L (for two doses mRNA plus i.n. 3rd immunization) or 1.6 mL (for one dose mRNA plus 2nd i.n. immunization), and Nasal wash of 1 mL collected were stored at -80°C for ELISA or neutralization assay. The cells were collected for flow cytometry analysis. 200 pfu Influenza A/PR8/34 were used to infect mice intranasally. At day 6 post infection, the left lobe of the lung was subjected for histopathology. Binding antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 General ELISA method has been previously described (19). Briefly, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins including RBD (Sino Biological, 40592-V08H), spike S1 D614G (S1) (Sino Biological, 40591-V08H3), spike S1+S2 ECD (S) (Sino

Biological, 40589-V08H4), or nucleocapsid protein (N) (GenScript, Z03488) were precoated to 96-well plates overnight at 4°C. The following day, plates were washed with wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) and then blocked with Assay dilution buffer (Biolegend, 421203) for 1 hour at RT. Plasma or 20x concentrated BAL from unvaccinated donors, vaccinated and convalescents were diluted in "Assay dilution buffer" starting at a 1:5 or 1:1 dilution, respectively, and then serially diluted by a factor of 5. Plasma from mice were diluted starting at 1:100 dilution, and then serially diluted by a factor of 5. BAL from mice was not concentrated or diluted. Samples were added to the plate and incubated for 2 hours at RT. After washing three times with wash buffer, secondary antibodies diluted with "Assay dilution buffer" were added to the plate and then incubated for 1 hour at RT. Secondary antibodies including anti-human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, A6029), anti-human IgA (Hybridoma Reagent Laboratory, HP6123), anti-human IgM (Sigma Aldrich, A6907), anti-mouse IgG (SouthernBiotech,1030-05), anti-mouse IgA (SouthernBiotech, 1040-05), anti-mouse IgM (SouthernBiotech, 1020-05) were diluted as indicated respectively. Plates were washed three times and then developed with 3,3,5,5 tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 00-420156) for 10 min at RT. Sulfuric acid (2 M) was used as STOP buffer. Plates were read at about 5 min on a microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 450 nm with SoftMax Pro Software. The optical density (OD) value at 1:5 dilution for human plasma, 1:1 dilution for human BAL, 1:100 for mice plasma (1:500 for IgG), or original mice BAL and Nasal wash were displayed, respectively; one dot represents each individual.
Neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV2
Pseudovirus neutralization assays were performed as previously reported (57). Briefly, in a 96-well format, plasma or BAL were diluted starting at a 1:40 or 1:20 dilution, respectively, and then serially diluted by a factor of 4. The pseudoviruses including D614G, Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron BA.1.1 were incubated with plasma or BAL for 1 hour at 37°C, followed by infection of 2x104 pre-seeded HEK293T-ACE2 cells (BEI, NR-52511) on a 96-well polystyrene tissue culture plate. Gaussia luciferase activity in cell culture media was assayed 48 hours and 72 hours after infection. Note that, to ensure valid comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 variants, equivalent amounts of pseudovirus were used based on the pre-determined virus titers and samples of different variants were loaded side by side in each plate. Neutralizing titer 50% (NT50) for each sample was determined by non-linear regression with least squares fit in GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software).
Flow Cytometry analysis Fresh mice and human cells or frozen human PBMC or BAL cells recovered and rested overnight in 37°C, 5% CO2

incubator, were washed with FACS buffer (1% FBS and 0.5 M EDTA in PBS), then stained with antibodies as listed in Table. S2 for human and Table. S3 for mice. Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS) was performed to detect vaccinespecific T cell response. Briefly, Cells were washed with FACS buffer and resuspended with complete RPMI with 10 mM HEPES supplemented with 10% FBS, 2-Mercaptoethanol, Sodium Pyruvate, Non-Essential Amino Acids, Pen-Strep, and L-Glutamine. Cells were then stimulated with 1 g/mL S peptide pool (JPT, PM-WCPV-S) for stimulation for 6 hours (PBMC for 16 hours). In the last 4 hours of incubation, protein transport inhibitor Brefeldin-A was added. Cells stimulated with PMA/Ionomycin or DMSO only were included as positive control and negative control, respectively. Following stimulation, cells were first stained for surface markers on ice for 30 min. After washing with PBS, cells were resuspended with Zombie-dye for viability staining and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 15 min. Following surface and viability staining, cells were fixed with fixation buffer (Biolegend, 420801) and permeabilized with perm/wash buffer (Biolegend, 421002), followed by intracellular cytokine staining on ice for 30 min. Cells were then washed with perm/wash buffer and resuspended with FACS buffer. To detect RBDspecific B cells, recombinant RBD proteins coupled with PE and APC were incubated with the cells for 30 min at 4°C. RBD-PE and RBD-APC double-positive B cells were identified as RBD+ B cells. To detect S539-546 epitope specific CD8+ T cells, SARS-CoV-2 S539-546 MHC class I tetramer (H-2Kb) (NIH Tetramer Core) was incubated with the cells for 30 min at 4°C. CD44+ Tetramer+ positive CD8+ T cells were identified as S539546 epitope specific CD8+ T cells. Cell population data were acquired on a multi-spectral flow cytometer Cytek Aurora (Cytek Biosciences) or Attune NxT (Thermo Fisher Science) and analyzed using FlowJo Software (10.8.1, Tree Star). All human data from cytokines production assay were background-subtracted using paired DMSO treated control samples.
Histopathology At 6 days post infection with Ad5-S or PR8, left lobe of the whole lung from mice was harvested and fixed in formalin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) until embedding. Fixed lung tissues were embedded in paraffin. lung tissue slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin by University of Virginia Research Histology Core (Charlottesville, VA), and scanned by University of Virginia Biorepository and Tissue Research Facility (BTRF) (Charlottesville, VA). Statistical analysis Statistical tests are indicated in the corresponding figure legends. One way ANOVA was used in multi group comparison. Paired t test was used in PBMC and BAL paired comparison. Others were analyzed using independent t test. All tests were performed with a nominal significance threshold of P <

0.05, which displayed by a single asterisk. P > 0.05 was dis-
played by ns, means not significant. Two asterisks indicate P
< 0.01, Three asterisks indicate P < 0.001, four asterisks indi-
cate P < 0.0001.

ABSTRACT
SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge facing established herd immunity. L452R, previously featured in the Delta variant, quickly emerged in Omicron subvariants, including BA.4/BA.5, implying a continued selection pressure on this residue. The underlying links between spike mutations and their selective pressures remain incompletely understood. Here, by analyzing 221 structurally characterized antibodies, we found that IGHV1-69-encoded antibodies preferentially contact L452 using germline-encoded hydrophobic residues at the tip of HCDR2 loop. Whereas somatic hypermutations or VDJ rearrangements are required to acquire L452-contacting hydrophobic residues for non-IGHV169 encoded antibodies. Antibody repertoire analysis revealed that IGHV1-69 L452-contacting antibody lineages are commonly induced among COVID-19 convalescents but non-IGHV1-69 encoded antibodies exhibit limited prevalence. In addition, we experimentally demonstrated that L452R renders most published IGHV1-69 antibodies ineffective. Furthermore, we found that IGHV1-69 L452-contacting antibodies are enriched in convalescents experienced Omicron BA.1 (without L452R) breakthrough infections but rarely found in Delta (with L452R) breakthrough infections. Taken together, these findings support that IGHV1-69 population antibodies contribute to selection pressure for L452 substitution. This study thus provides a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 variant genesis and immune evasion.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global health concern. Since the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a number of Variants of Concern (VOCs) or Variants of Interest (VOIs) have emerged, including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.429 (Epsilon), and BA.1.1.529 (Omicron BA.1) [1]. Analysis of their spike sequences identified that K417, L452, E484 and N501 within the receptor binding domain (RBD) are mutation hotspots and numerous substitutions have been observed at these locations among variants. It has been proposed that these recurrent RBD substitutions are associated with modulating

ACE2-spike interactions and/or evasion of cellular/antibody mediated immunity. These substitutions presumably gave mutant viruses advantages in human-tohuman transmission leading to their spread [2,3].
Before global dominance of Omicron BA.1 variant, Delta variant featuring a L452R substitution was the dominant strain worldwide. L452R was first observed in B.1.427/B.1.429 variants which were dominant in California between November and December 2020 [4]. Studies on Delta variant found that L452R mutation reduced neutralizing activities of 14 out of 34 isolated RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). It has milder effect in reducing neutralizing activity of convalescent sera [2,5,6]. Most recently, L452Q, L452M, and L452R have been identified in

Omicron subvariants BA.2.12.1, BA.2.13, and BA.4/ BA.5, respectively [7], indicating active substitution events at this site. It is currently understood that although mutations are result of error-prone viral replication, dominant variants were selected for transmission advantages. It is conceivable that population immune pressure established from prior infections or vaccinations plays crucial roles in driving virus evolution [8], and variants with ability to evade population antibody responses would possess a considerable transmission advantage.
To help understanding virus evolution, it is therefore important to analyze the prevalence of antibody lineages that are shared among the human population. Variants of SARS-CoV-2 bear mutations that allow escape from neutralization by different classes of antibodies, especially those belonging to classes widely distributed in the human population [9]. Previously, we and others have reported that IGHV3-53-encoded neutralizing antibodies are commonly elicited by SARSCoV-2 infection and they share similar binding mode to RBD [10-12]. It has been identified that recurrent mutation K417N abolishes neutralization by this class of shared antibodies [12]. Similar to K417N, L452R has been also recurrent in various VoCs. However, it is unclear whether the appearance of L452 substitution is related to the immune pressure of share neutralizing antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2. In this report, we identified that IGHV1-69 gene encodes antibodies of 3 major clonotypes and these antibodies are widely induced in vaccinees or convalescents of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain (wildtype, WT). We identified that IGHV1-69 antibodies preferentially recognize L452 using preexisting hydrophobic residues at the tip of heavy chain complementary determining region 2 (HCDR2) of germline IGHV1-69 gene. By antigen binding and virus neutralization experiments, we confirmed that L452R can specifically evade binding and neutralization by many IGHV1-69 antibodies. We provide evidence that IGHV1-69-encoded L452contacting mAbs are differentially recalled in Delta and Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infections, further revealing L452R's ability to impair immune memory recall in addition to evasion of physical antibody binding. These findings point to an immune selection pressure for L452R mutation contributed by IGHV169-encoded neutralizing antibodies. The findings reported here facilitate better understanding of SARSCoV-2 variant genesis and will help rationalize consequences of immune evasion by generated variants.
Materials and methods
Cell lines
HEK293F cells (ATCC, USA) were cultured in CD 293 TGE medium (ACRO, China) with shaking (120-

130 rpm) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Vero E6 cells (ATCC, USA), 293 T cells (ATCC, USA), and Huh-7 cell (ATCC, USA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (GIBCO, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, USA) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.
Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike variants and published SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody sequences
Per-site variation of SARS-CoV-2 spike was calculated by sequence entropy using the COVID-19 Viral Genome Analysis Pipeline (https://cov.lanl.gov/ components/sequence/COV/int_sites_tbls.comp?t=2) that enabled by data from the Global Initiative for Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID; https:// gisaid.org). A total of 2438500 SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected before 16 June 2022 were included in this analysis. The germline usage distribution of RBD-targeting mAbs was calculated using the data from COVAbDab database (the coronavirus antibody database) (http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/covabdab/). A total of 4002 RBD-targeting mAbs isolated from ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals or vaccinees (accessed before June 22, 2022) were included in this analysis. The frequency distribution of IGHV genes in RBD-targeting mAbs were compared to the IGHV distributions in healthy human antibody repertoires (PRJCA007067 and PRJCA00375) [10,13,14].
Characteristics analysis of RBD-specific mabs isolated from delta and omicron breakthrough infections
RBD-targeting mAbs isolated from Delta and Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infections were curated from recently published data [15-18]. 110 and 309 mAbs isolated from convalescents experienced Delta breakthrough infections and Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infections were obtained respectively. The frequency distribution of IGHV genes in RBD-targeting mAbs isolated from convalescents experienced Delta and Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infections were compared to the IGHV distributions in mAbs isolated from COVID-19 vaccinees. The HCDR3 amino acids similarity between structurally characterized IGHV1-69-encoded L452-contacting mAbs and IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs isolated from COVID-19 vaccinees, Delta breakthrough infected individuals, or Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infected individuals were calculated using R package stringdist v0.9.8 (https://github.com/markvanderloo/stringdist). Antibody with a GYSGYG/D-like motif or with >75% HCDR3 amino acid similarity to R1-32/FC08 was defined as a R1-32-like antibody [19]. The binding affinity data of R1-32-like antibodies to Delta RBD

and WT RBD were compiled from published literatures [16,19-23], and foldchange of the binding affinities of R1-32-like mAbs to Delta RBD relative to WT RBD were calculated.
Structural analysis
Human SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific mAbs with available structures were downloaded from the PDB (https://www.rcsb.org/). A total of 221 antibodyRBD/Spike complexes were curated. Buried surface area (BSA) was calculated using the PDBe PISA server (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot_int/). Antibody with a non-zero BSA on L452 were identified as a L452-contacting antibody. Structure figures were generated by PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (Schrödinger).
Analysis of antibody lineage occurrence among L452-contacting antibodies in COVID-19 patients
To determine the occurrence of L452-contacting antibody lineages in COVID-19 patients, we analyzed the IgH sequences from previously published datasets (PRJCA007067 and PRJCA00375) [10,13,14], including 65 blood samples from 33 COVID-19 patients. The V(D)J assignments and HCDR determination were done using MIXCR v3.0.3 [24]. IgH sequences that related to L452-contacting mAbs were defined as those sequences utilizing the same IGHV and IGHJ gene segments, identical HCDR3 length, and 75% HCDR3 identity. Visualizations were performed using R software (https://www.r-project.org/). Three IGHV1-69-emcoded L452-contacting antibody clonotypes were identified. Sequence logo plot of the HCDR3s of three L452-contacting antibody clonotypes were visualized using online server Weblogo (https://weblogo.berkeley.edu/logo.cgi).
Expression of monoclonal antibody
The antibody heavy- and light-V genes (VH/VL) were synthesized (Genscript, China) and were cloned into human IgG1 expression vectors using Clone Express II One Step Cloning Kit (Vazyme, China). When density of HEK293F cells reached 1 × 106 cells/mL, equal amounts of heavy- and light-chain plasmids were transfected into HEK293F cells using EZ cell transfection reagent (Life-iLab Biotech, China). Following transfection, HEK293F cells were cultured in CD 293 TGE medium (ACRO, China) containing 10% CD Feed X supplement (ACRO, China) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator shaking at 120 rpm. 6 days post transfection, supernatants were harvested and clarified by centrifugation. Supernatants were filtered through 0.22-µm filters (Merck Millipore,

Germany) before incubated with Protein A Resin (Genscript, China) at room temperature for 2 h for antibody affinity purification. After washing, antibodies were eluted from the Protein A Resin using 0.1 M Na-Citrate (pH 3.25) and eluents were neutralized immediately with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8). Antibodies were concentrated in PBS using Amicon Ultrafilter (Merck Millipore, USA) (GIBCO, USA) and stored at -80°C.
SARS-CoV-2 RBD expression
HEK293F cells were transfected with plasmids (pcDNA3.1 vector) coding SARS-CoV-2 WT-RBD, L452R-RBD, E484K-RBD, E484Q-RBD, or E484ARBD (residues 319-541) with a C-terminal 6-His-tag using EZ Cell Transfection reagent (Life-iLab, China). 24 h post transfection, Feed X Supplement was added to culture media at 10% volume ratio. 5 days post transfection, supernatants of cell culture were collected and cleared using 0.22-µm filters. Individual harvested supernatant was supplemented with 25 mM phosphate pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, and 0.5 mM PMSF before recirculated onto a HiTrap TALON crude column (Cytiva, USA) 3 times. The column was washed with buffer A (25 mM phosphate pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl and 5 mM imidazole), bound RBD was eluted with buffer B (25 mM phosphate pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl and 500 mM imidazole). Purified RBDs were concentrated in PBS using Amicon Ultrafilters (Merck Millipore, USA) and stored at -80°C.
Biolayer interferometry
Binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and antibodies was measured by biolayer interferometry (BLI) using an Octet RED96e system (FortéBio, USA). All experiments were performed at 25°C with shaking at 1,000 r.p.m, and anti-human IgG biosensors were pre-equilibrated in Q buffer containing PBS (10 mM pH7.4), 0.02% Tween-20, and 0.2% BSA for at least 600 s before use. Antibodies were diluted to 11 g/ mL before loaded onto protein A biosensors for 60 s. Antibody loaded biosensors were dipped into wells containing 200 nM SARS-CoV-2 RBD-His recombinant proteins or Q buffer (as control) for 300 s to monitor association. Dissociation was monitored by moving biosensors into Q buffer for 300 s. Binding data was analyzed using FortéBio data analysis software.
ELISA assay to determine antibody binding activity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD
96 well assay plates were coated with 100 µL per well of SARS-CoV-2 WT-RBD, E484K-RBD, E484Q-RBD, or

2752

E484A-RBD recombinant proteins at 1 µg/mL in PBS overnight at 4°C, respectively. After standard washing, 5% skim milk (200 µL per well) was added to block for 2 h at 37°C. After washing wells three times with PBS0.05% Tween 20 (MP), 100 µL semilogarithmic dilutions in PBS of antibodies were added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. After washing wells 3 times with PBS-0.05% Tween 20, plates were incubated with 1:5000 dilutions of HRP-labelled Goat Anti-Human IgG (H + L) (Beyotime, China) in 5% skim milk at 37°C for 1 h. After washing wells 6 times with PBS-0.05% Tween 20, 100 µL per well of TMB/E solution (Merck Millipore) was added and developed at room temperature for 15 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 50 µL 1 M sulphuric acid and OD values at 450 nm were measured.

SARS-CoV-2 foci reduction neutralization test
Antibodies were serial diluted with DMEM and mixed with 200 FFU Wuhan-Hu-1 (wildtype) or Delta variant authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, antibody-virus mixtures were added to a 96-well plate cultured with Vero E6 cells and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 1 h. After removing the inocula, plates were overlaid with 100 L 1.6% carboxymethylcellulose warmed to 37°C per well After culturing for 24 h, overlays were removed and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Biosharp, China) and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma, USA). Cells were incubated with a human anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein monoclonal antibody (obtained by laboratory screening) at 37°C for 1 h. After washing with 0.15% PBST three times, cells were incubated with an HRP-labeled goat antihuman secondary antibody (Cat. No.: 609-035-213, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. West Grove, PA) at 37°C for 1 h. Plates were washed with 0.15% PBST three times, before the foci were visualized by TrueBlue Peroxidase Substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), and counted with an ELISPOT reader (Cellular Technology Ltd. Cleveland, OH). The foci reduction neutralization test (FRNT50) was calculated by Spearman-Karber method. The SARS-CoV-2 WT was isolated from a COVID-19 patient [25]. This virus is stored in Guangzhou Customs District Technology Center BSL-3 Laboratory. The SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) strain is stored at Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China. Experiments using SARS-CoV-2 authentic viruses were conducted in Guangzhou Customs District Technology Center BSL-3 Laboratory.

Pseudovirus-neutralization assay
SARS-CoV-2 WT, Omicron BA.1.1.529, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.13, and BA.4/BA.5 spike plasmids were

constructed using the pcDNA3.1 vector. G*G-VSV virus (VSV G pseudotyped virus) was used to infect 293T cells, and spike protein-expressing plasmid was used for transfection at the same time. After culture, the supernatant containing pseudovirus was collected, filtered, aliquoted, and frozen at -80 °C for further use. Monoclonal antibodies were serially diluted (threefold) in DMEM (GIBCO, USA) and mixed with pseudovirus in 96-well plates. After incubation at 5% CO2 and 37 °C for 1 h, digested Huh-7 cells were seeded. After 24 h of culture, supernatant was discarded and d-luciferin reagent (PerkinElmer, USA) was added to react in the dark. The luminescence value was measured using a microplate spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, USA). IC50 was calculated by a four-parameter logistic regression model using PRISM v 8.0.1.
Results
L452-contacting mAbs show IGHV germline gene preference
Analysis of 2,438,500 SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited in GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) showed that L452 is one of the most active mutation hotspot on RBD (Figure S1A). Structural analysis showed that L452 is in proximity to the RBD-ACE2 binding interface (Figure S1B), but pointing away from the interface to form a hydrophobic patch with F490 (we noted 490 is also a mutation hotspot) and L492 (Figure S1C). Substitution of L452 to a charged residue R led to a moderate increase in affinity towards ACE2 receptor (Figure S1C,D), increased ACE2 affinity was shown to enhance infectivity of human cells [5].
To identify neutralizing antibodies contacting L452, we analyzed epitopes of all the human mAbs structures in complex with SARS-CoV-2 RBD/Spike available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (deposited before 22 June, 2022) (Table S1). We identified that 69 out of 221 human RBD-targeting mAbs contact with residue L452 (Figure 1(A)), including those approved for emergency use authorization (EUA) or in clinical trials such as LY-CoV555 (bamlanivimab), CT-P59 (regdanvimab), COV2-2130 (cilgavimab), and REGN10933 (casirivimab) (Table S1). Although the 69 L452-contacting mAbs are derived from 29 different IGHV genes, more than half of them are encoded by four IGHVs: IGHV1-69, IGHV1-2, IGHV3-30, and IGHV3-11 (Figure 1(B)). We investigated percentage of L452-contacting antibodies among the structurally characterized antibodies encoded by the four IGHV genes. We found that 14/19, 8/11, 8/16, and 5/6 of structurally characterized IGHV1-69, IGHV1-2, IGHV3-30, and IGHV3-11 antibodies contact L452, respectively (Figure 1(C)). This observation suggests

potential preferential germline usage for L452 recognition. Germline gene usage analysis of 4002 isolated RBD-targeting mAbs from CoV-AbDab (the coronavirus antibody database) [26] (deposited before June 22, 2022) showed that IGHV1-69, IGHV3-30, IGHV1-2 are over-represented in this database. In

particular, IGHV3-30 and IGHV1-69 ranked 2nd and 3rd among isolated RBD-targeting mAbs. Of note, it has been previously shown that IGHV3-30 and IGHV1-69 are among the most frequently utilized antibody genes, ranking 2nd and 5th among healthy human antibody repertoires (Figure 1(D)).

IGHV1-69-encoded L452-contacting antibodies are widely induced in COVID-19 patients
To determine the occurrence of L452-contacting antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, we attempted to identify their related antibody lineages from antibody repertoire data of COVID-19 patients we previously sequenced. Antibody repertoire data from blood samples collected at various time points after infection in a cohort of 33 COVID-19 patients were used [10,13,14]. We were able to identify antibody sequences highly similar (heavy chain with the same IGHV and IGHJ, identical HCDR3 length, and 75% HCDR3 AA sequence identity) to the structurally characterized IGVH1-69-encoded L452-contacting mAbs. Three highly shared antibody clonotypes encoded by IGHV1-69 are widely present in the antibody repertoires of COVID-19 patients (Figure 1(E), Figure S2A). The first clonotype is related to the L452-targeting antibody S2D106, whose HCDR3s share a conserved CSGGSCY motif. The second clonotype is related to the L452-contacting antibodies DH1043 and BG1-24, whose HCDR3s share a conserved YYDSSGY motif. The third clonotype is related to our previously identified R1-32-like antibodies that share a GYSGYG/D motif in their HCDR3s [19] (Figure S2A). Whereas sequences similar to structurally characterized IGHV1-2, IGHV3-30, IGHV3-11 and other IGHVs encoded L452-contacting mAbs showed no or limited detection in COVID-19 patients (Figure 1(E)). Given that sequences highly similar to IGHV1-69-encoded RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies were widely identified in a broad COVID-19 patient population, we speculate IGHV1-69-encoded RBD-targeting antibodies are likely involved in SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity, and L452R substitution is likely evolved to counteract IGHV1-69-encoded neutralizing antibodies shared among population.

IGHV1-69-encoded L452-contacting mAbs possess a germline hydrophobic HCDR2 loop for L452 recognition
We further investigated structurally characterized antibodies and their interactions with L452 by computing buried surface areas (BSAs) at 452. We found that IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs generally bury more surface area at 452, followed by IGHV3-11, IGHV330, and IGHV1-2 (Figure 2(A)). Of note, the EUA mAb LY-CoV555 has the highest BSA at L452 and another EUA mAb CT-P59 ranks 4th (Figure 2(A)). Both antibodies have been shown to be escaped by the Delta variant [2]. The mean BSA for residue L452 in IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs is 39.8±8.2 Å2, by comparison, the mean BSA for residue L452 in IGHV1-2, IGHV3-30, IGHV3-11, and other IGHVsencoded mAbs is 14.3±8.6 Å2, 25.9±11.7 Å2, 31.2

±14.5 Å2, and 25.1±14.5 Å2, respectively (Figure 2 (B)). This result suggests IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs likely have a preference for L452 recognition. Next, we compared binding modes of the L452-contacting mAbs. The 14 IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs segregated into two groups, one comprised of mAbs (LYCoV555, MW01, MW05, DH1043, S2D106, DH1042, BG1-24, C548, and XGv282) that targeted an ACE2-competitive site and the other containing mAbs (47D11, JMB2002, FC08, R1-32, and 52) that recognized a non-ACE2 competitive region (Figure S2B). We found that most ACE2-competitive IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs share similar binding modes approaching RBD with similar angles. NonACE2-competitive mAbs FC08, R1-32, and 52 also share similar binding mode. The conserved motifs in HCDR3s of the different clonotype appear to play a key role for RBD engagement and probably determined antibody binding mode (Figure S2C). However, importantly, we identified that whether they are ACE2-competitive or not these IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs share a common feature in L452 recognition (Figure 2(C), Figure S2B). Except for mAb C548, all the other 13 IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs use HCDR2 hydrophobic residues to interact with the L452 formed hydrophobic patch (Figure 2(C)). Of note, these hydrophobic residues represent a conserved feature on the tip of IGHV1-69 HCDR2 loop (positions 54, 55) and are encoded by IGHV1-69 germline alleles (Figure 2(C), Figure S3A). In contrast, no conserved hydrophobic residue was observed for IGHV1-2, IGHV3-30, IGHV3-11 or other IGHVs encoded mAbs to interact with L452, albeit hydrophobic contact serves as the most common mode of L452 interaction. Non-IGHV1-69 antibodies contact L452 by somatically mutated residues (e.g. N54I (2-15, S2M11), N54V (C121), and S56F (BD-667)) (Figure 2(C)) or by HCDR3 residues generated from VDJ recombination (e.g. V98 (CV05-163), V104 (75, A19-46.1, P2B-2F6), Y106 (CT-P59), L103 (278), and I100b (1-57)) (Figure 2(C)). Even though some somatic mutations were observed in HCDR2 loops of the characterized IGHV1-69-encoded antibodies including I54V (MW01), I54M (BG1-24, S2D106, 52, DH1042), L55I (FC08), and L55V (XGv282), all these were mutations between hydrophobic amino acids (Figure S3(A,B)). Among the 69 structurally characterized L452-contacting mAbs, only the IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs possess multiple hydrophobic residues at the tip of HCDR2 loop. Hydrophobicity analysis of all the human IGHV germline genes revealed that the IGHV1-69 (19 alleles) is the only human heavy-chain gene that encodes hydrophobic residues at the tip of HCDR2 loop (Figure S3C), indicating L452 binding can be achieved by germline IGHV1-69 antibodies without requiring somatic hypermutation. Whereas somatic hypermutations or

mAbs. We expressed a panel of representative mAbs for binding and neutralization tests. The binding assays showed that almost all the tested IGHV1-69encoded mAbs (except C548) exhibited reduced affinity to L452R RBD (Figure 3(A)), with an average reduction of 8.6 folds (Figure 3(B)). Meanwhile, we found that mAbs such as nCoV617 (IGHV3-30), CV07-270, BD-667 (IGHV3-11), P2B-2F6, and BD368-2 that derived from non-IGHV1-69 germlines

also can be heavily affected by L452R substitution (Figure S4A). However, we observed some of the L452-contacting mAbs such as 2-15, CV05-163 (IGHV1-2), and A19-61.1 (IGHV3-30) that generally have lower BSAs at L452 (Figure 2(A,B)) are unaffected by L452R substitution (Figure S4A). Further analysis found that the sensitivities of these L452-contacting mAbs to L452R are negatively correlated with their BSAs at L452 (Figure S4B). This observation explains why most IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs are sensitive to L452R because they have a higher BSAs at L452 (Figure 2(A,B)). Consistent with the decreased binding affinities to L452R, the tested IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs also exhibited reduced neutralization of L452R bearing B.1.617.2 variant (Delta) (Figure 3(C)), with an average reduction of 19 folds (Figure 3(D)). Next, we investigated whether these IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs are affected by Omicron (without L452 substitution) or its subvariants (with L452X substitution). By pseudovirus-neutralization assay we showed that ACE2-competitive mAbs, LY-CoV555, MW01, and DH1043, are generally sensitive to both Omicron and its subvariants. However, the non-ACE2-competitive mAbs, R1-32 and FC08, are relatively insensitive to Omicron and BA.2.13 (with L452M) but more sensitive to BA.2.12.1 (with L452Q) and BA.4/BA.5 (L452R) (Figure S4C). Collectively, the above results showed that L452R significantly reduced affinity and neutralization activities of the IGHV1-69-encoded antibodies (Figure 3(B,D)), rendering most of them ineffective (Figure 3(E)).

IGHV1-69-encoded L452-contacting mAbs are enriched in Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection but not in Delta breakthrough infection
Since L452R substitution confers resistance to IGHV1-69-encoded RBD-targeting mAbs (Figure 3), and IGHV1-69-encoded RBD-targeting mAbs are widely elicited by primary infection of the SARSCoV-2 ancestral strain (Figure 1(C)), it raises the question whether IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs could be induced by COVID-19 vaccination or breakthrough infection. To answer this question, we first investigated the germline usage of 618 RBD-targeting mAbs isolated from COVID-19 vaccinees in CoVAbDab [26]. Consistent with primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs are highly enriched in COVID-19 vaccinees similar to IGHV353/3-66 and IGHV3-30 mAbs (Figure 4(A)), indicating similar RBD-specific antibody induction between vaccination and natural infection. However, we did not observe an enrichment of IGHV1-69 in Delta breakthrough infection. Only 10 (4.4%) IGHV1-69encoded mAbs was found among 225 Delta RBD-

reactive mAbs [17,18], indicating that IGHV1-69 encoded antibodies did not respond to Delta breakthrough infection (Figure 4(A)). In contrast to IGHV1-69, IGHV3-53/3-66 are over-represented in Delta breakthrough infection because this class of antibodies, including B-38 [27], CC12.1 [11], COVOX-222 [28], and rmAb23 [10], are known to maintain neutralizing activities to Delta variant (Figure S5). Unlike Delta breakthrough infection, Omicron BA.1 (without L452 substitution) breakthrough infection massively induced IGHV1-69encoded antibody clones, representing with 11.65% (2nd most frequent) of 309 Omicron RBD-reactive mAbs [15,16] (Figure 4(A)). Structural analysis showed that two IGHV1-69-encoded Omicron RBDreactive mAbs Omi-2 and Omi-31 that isolated from Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection shared the same binding mode with those isolated from primary SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain infection (Figure 4(B), Figure 2(C), Figure S2B). Both Omi-2 and Omi-31 use their hydrophobic residues at the tip of HCDR2 loops to engage the L452 containing hydrophobic patch (Figure 4(B)) and Omi-31 is heavily affected by L452R substitution [15].
Sequence analysis showed that IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs isolated from vaccination and Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection but not from Delta breakthrough infection are highly similar with the structurally characterized L452-contacting mAbs encoded by IGHV1-69 (Figure S6A). Notably, most of the IGHV1-69-encoded clones isolated from Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection utilize IGLV1-40 lightchain gene and have a preferred length of 17 aminoacid HCDR3s and a GYSGYG/D-like motif, which are related to our previous reported R1-32-like antibody lineage (non-ACE2 competitive) that isolated from primary SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain infection or vaccination (Figure 4(D), Figure S2A, Figure S6B). By reanalyzing the binding affinity data [16], we found that the IGHV1-69-encoded clones isolated from Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection showed around 10-fold reduced binding affinity to the Delta variant (Figure 4(C,D)). Structural analysis revealed that the epitope residues of R1-32-like mAbs (R1-32 and FC08) are not affected by mutations in Omicron BA.1, whereas most of ACE2-competitive IGHV1-69 mAbs largely interact with E484 (Figure S6B). We showed by ELISA that ACE2-competitive IGHV1-69 mAbs, LY-CoV555, MW01, and DH1043, are generally sensitive to E484 mutations (Omicron BA.1 has E484A) but the non-ACE2-competitive IGHV1-69 mAbs, R1-32 and FC08, are relatively insensitive to the E484 mutations (Figure 4(E)). The above observations suggest a preferential recalling of the nonACE2-competitive IGHV1-69-encoded memory B cell response following Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection, thereby increasing selection for L452.

IGHV1-69-encoded antibodies appear to have preexisting ability to bind L452 without requiring VDJ recombination or somatic hypermutation. These

unique characteristics and frequent presentation of IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs in human antibody repertoires led us to propose that this class of antibodies contributes to immune pressure driving the L452R mutation. Consistently, we demonstrated experimentally that L452R was able to abrogate binding and neutralization by most known IGHV1-69-encoded L452contacting mAbs.
In addition to natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination also induced the enrichment of L452-contacting mAbs encoded by IGHV1-69, suggesting an established population immune pressure from prior infections or vaccinations. However, the preferential induction of IGHV1-69 was not observed in breakthrough infections by the L452R bearing Delta variant, indicating that L452R substitution not only confer virus ability to evade neutralization by IGHV1-69-encoded mAbs but also ability to suppress reactivation of immune memory. In this respect, IGHV1-69 antibody response is different to IGHV3-53/3-66 responses that even though Omicron variants contain the K417N mutation, IGHV353/3-66-encoded antibodies (also a shared antibody response) could be recalled following Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection with some recalled mAbs showing K417N resistance [15]. These observations confirmed that certain spike mutations may not only evade physical binding by antibodies but also modulate antibody responses by suppressing induction of certain antibody classes.
While preparing this manuscript, we noted that L452 in the current circulating Omicron sub-variants is undergoing continued evolution. L452Q, L452M, and L452R have been identified in BA.2.12.1, BA.2.13, and BA.4/BA.5, respectively. Our analysis and existing report [16] showed that Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection massively recalled the wildtype-induced non-ACE2 competitive L452-contacting mAbs encoded by IGHV1-69. The biased induction of non-ACE2-competitive IGHV1-69 antibodies especially the R1-32-like antibodies in Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection likely enhanced selection pressure for L452 substitution. These IGHV1-69 mAbs showed cross-reactivities to both wildtype and Omicron BA.1 viruses, but are heavily escaped by L452R. Consistent with our results, Cao et al., recently found that the FC08 and other R1-32-like IGHV1-69 class of mAbs (e.g. BD-380, BD-421, BD-901, C091, XGv-271) are sensitive to L452X mutations using high-throughput yeast-display-based deep mutational scanning (DMS) assays [7]. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 BA.4/BA.5 escape mAbs and serum antibodies elicited by Omicron BA.1 infection, particularly the newly added mutation L452R and F486V in BA.4/BA.5 [7, 15, 29]. The analysis presented in this report provides some explanation for the rapid emergence of L452 substitutions in Omicron subvariants. Moreover,

since Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection induced a skewed antibody response targeting L452, it likely increased the possibility of repeated infection by L452R harbouring BA.4/BA.5.
Existing studies have shown that certain antibodies against a particular epitope share a restricted set of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes and are often quite similar in overall structure and function [30,31]. For example, broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the E2 antigenic region 3 (AR3) of HCV are mainly derived from IGHV1-69 [32,33]. IGHV1-69 has been also identified as one of the major classes of antibodies against the Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) stem region [34,35]. In these studies, it has been demonstrated that IGHV1-69 germline-encoded HCDR2 hydrophobic residues are essential for HCV and Influenza epitope recognition [31], consistent with our finding on IGHV1-69encoded SARS-CoV-2 S-specific antibodies. Therefore, a recurring theme emerges that hydrophobic epitopes of diverse viral envelope glycoproteins can be preferentially recognized by germline-encoded hydrophobic residues at the tip of the HCDR2 loop of IGHV1-69-encoded antibodies. Such class of antibodies can be readily produced by multiple individuals, representing an immunological solution in response to emerging pathogens, and demonstrating an evolutionary advantage for primates to possess the IGHV1-69 gene [36]. However, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, the virus demonstrates a remarkable ability to adapt and evade the host immune response.
Immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 is highly complex, and other selection pressures could exist for the emergence of L452R. Nevertheless, our analysis points to a link between L452 substitution and herd immunity that is constituted by IGHV1-69-encoded neutralizing antibodies. Insights into antibody-mediated selection pressure on SARS-CoV-2 should provide theoretical framework for better understanding of variant genesis and variant immune evasion.

ABSTRACT The polysaccharide capsule of Cryptococcus neoformans--an opportunistic basidiomycete pathogen and the major etiological agent of fungal meningoencephalitis--is a key virulence factor that prevents its phagocytosis by host innate immune cells. However, the complex signaling networks for their synthesis and attachment remain elusive. In this study, we systematically analyzed capsule biosynthesis and signaling networks using C. neoformans transcription factor (TF) and kinase mutant libraries under diverse capsule-inducing conditions. We found that deletion of GAT201, YAP1, BZP4, and ADA2 consistently caused capsule production defects in all tested media, indicating that they are capsule-regulating core TFs. Epistatic and expression analyses showed that Yap1 and Ada2 control Gat201 upstream, whereas Bzp4 and Gat201 independently regulate capsule production. Next, we searched for potential upstream kinases and found that mutants lacking PKA1, BUD32, POS5, IRE1, or CDC2801 showed reduced capsule production under all three capsule induction conditions, whereas mutants lacking HOG1 and IRK5 displayed enhanced capsule production. Pka1 and Irk5 controlled the induction of GAT201 and BZP4, respectively, under capsule induction conditions. Finally, we monitored the transcriptome profiles governed by Bzp4, Gat201, and Ada2 under capsule-inducing conditions and demonstrated that these TFs regulate redundant and unique sets of downstream target genes. Bzp4, Ada2, and Gat201 govern capsule formation in C. neoformans by regulating the expression of various capsule biosynthesis genes and chitin/chitosan synthesis genes in a positive and negative manner, respectively. In conclusion, this study provides further insights into the complex regulatory mechanisms of capsule productionrelated signaling pathways in C. neoformans.
IMPORTANCE Over the past decades, human fungal pathogens, including C. neoformans, have emerged as a major public threat since the AIDS pandemic, only to gain more traction in connection to COVID-19. Polysaccharide capsules are rare fungal virulence factors that are critical for protecting C. neoformans from phagocytosis by macrophages. To date, more than 75 proteins involved in capsule synthesis and cell wall attachment have been reported in C. neoformans; however, their complex upstream signaling networks remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that Ada2, Yap1, Bzp4, and Gat201 were key capsule-inducing transcriptional regulators. Yap1 and Ada2 function upstream of Gat201, whereas Bzp4 and Gat201 function independently. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling revealed that Bzp4, Gat201, and Ada2 promote capsule production and attachment by positively and negatively regulating genes involved in capsule synthesis and chitin/chitosan synthesis, respectively. Thus, this study provides comprehensive insights into the complex capsule-regulating signaling pathway in C. neoformans.

Cryptococcal Capsule-Regulating Pathways

Polysaccharide capsules are universal virulence factors for gal pathogens. For example, Streptococcus pneumoniae,

several bacterial and funa major etiological agent

for community-acquired pneumonia, contains 98 different polysaccharide capsule

types which play a pivotal role in its virulence by inhibiting opsonin-mediated phago-

cytosis (1). In Neisseria meningitidis, which causes bacterial meningitis, the polysaccha-

ride capsule (serogroups A, B, C, W, X, and Y) is the major virulence determinant (2).

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen which causes tuberculosis, also contains a

glycogen-like, a-glucan-type polysaccharide capsule that serves as an antiphagocytic

factor (3). The polysaccharide capsule is the major target for the development of vac-

cines against many bacteria because it is the dominant antigenic surface structure.

Although polysaccharide capsules are virulence determinants commonly found in bac-

terial pathogens, they are rarely observed in fungal pathogens. Nevertheless, polysaccha-

ride capsules are critical for the survival of Cryptococccus neoformans, a basidiomycete fun-

gal pathogen that causes fatal meningoencephalitis, in both natural environments and

susceptible hosts. In the natural environment, the capsule protects the fungus from desic-

cation and predation by nematodes or amoebae (4). Upon infection, capsule production is

further augmented by host-derived signals such as 5% CO2, low iron, neutral pH, and tis-

sue culture conditions (5, 6). Within the host, the capsule modulates the immune system

in various ways during infection. The capsule not only inhibits inflammatory cytokine pro-

duction, the antigen-presenting capacity of monocytes, and phagocytosis by macro-

phages, but also depletes complement components (7, 8). Furthermore, the capsule serves

as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger in macrophages (9). In fact, the mean capsule

size and cell wall thickness increase significantly during the course of infection (10) and

the deletion of capsule biosynthesis genes significantly attenuates the virulence of C. neo-

formans (11). Because polysaccharide capsules are uniquely present in C. neoformans

among pathogenic yeasts, the observation of encapsulated yeast cells in clinical samples,

such as cerebrospinal fluid, is a major indicator of cryptococcosis (12, 13).

Cryptococcal polysaccharide capsules are structurally distinct from other fungal cell

wall components and the mammalian extracellular matrix (14). The majority of the crypto-

coccal capsule (90% to 95%) is composed of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), which consists

of O-acetylated a-1,3-linked mannose polymer with xylosyl and glucuronyl side groups (5).

Galactoxylomannan (GalXM), composed of a-1,6-linked galactose polymers with manno-

syl, xylosyl, and glucuronyl side groups, comprises the remaining 5% to 10% of the capsule

(15). GXM and GalXM are synthesized within the cell, transported to the cell wall through

vesicles, and noncovalently attached to and polymerized on the cell surface, but they are

often shed extracellularly during infection (16). To date, at least 35 genes have been

reported to be involved in capsule biosynthesis, including CAP10, CAP59, CAP60, and

CAP64. All Cap proteins share homology with enzymes involved in polysaccharide biosyn-

thesis and modification (17). CAP10 encodes a 79-kDa type II membrane protein with an

N-linked glycosylation site (18). CAP59 and CAP60 are involved in the synthesis of GXM

(19). CAP64 and its five homologs have been implicated in GXM xylosylation and acetyla-

tion (5). Nevertheless, the specific functions of these Cap proteins in capsule formation

remain unclear.

Discovering polysaccharide capsule regulatory signaling pathways is critical for

understanding the virulence of C. neoformans. The cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and

high-osmolarity glycerol response (HOG) pathways have been considered central sig-

nal transduction systems to control capsule formation (20, 21). However, recent sys-

tematic functional analyses of signature-tagged mutants of 155 transcription factors

(TFs), 129 kinases, and 114 phosphatases in C. neoformans have revealed a number of

potential signaling components directly or indirectly involved in capsule production

(22-24), suggesting that capsule biosynthesis-regulating signaling networks are far

more complex than previously expected.

In this study, we systematically analyzed previously identified capsule-regulating

signaling TFs and kinases and their related networks under multiple capsule induction

conditions, including Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DMEM), Littman's (LIT), and fetal

bovine serum (FBS) media. This study provides further insights into the complex regulatory mechanisms of capsule production-related signaling pathways in C. neoformans.
RESULTS Identification of core capsule regulating transcription factors in Cryptococcus
neoformans. We quantitatively measured the capsule size in capsule-inducing media: LIT and 10% FBS for 49 previously reported TF mutants exhibiting altered capsule production levels in solid DMEM at 37°C (22) (Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The capsule thickness was measured by subtracting the cell diameter from the capsule diameter (total diameter 2 cell body diameter). We selected TF mutants which showed a 630% statistically significant difference in capsule thickness compared with the wildtype (WT) strain. Among the 49 TFs, 10 and 3 acted as positive and negative regulators, respectively, in LIT solid medium (Ada2, Bzp4, Gat201, Yap1, Hob3, Fzc1, Fzc30, Fzc46, Usv101, and Nrg1 as positive regulators; Fzc18, Fkh2, and Zfc3 as negative regulators) (Fig. S1). In addition, out of 13 TFs, deletion of four genes (GAT201, YAP1, BZP4, and ADA2) led to significantly reduced capsule production in FBS medium (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). The gat201D mutant exhibited the most defective capsule production; therefore, we focused on these four TFs for further experiments. However, none of the single mutants exhibited capsule production defects, such as that of the acapsular cap10D mutant (Fig. 1A), indicating that these TFs may play redundant roles or that multiple other TFs cooperate to control capsule production.
Next, we examined the roles of the four TFs in the regulation of the expression of capsule biosynthesis genes under capsule-inducing conditions (LIT, DMEM, and FBS). We found that the expression of capsule biosynthesis genes, such as CAP10, CAP59, CAP60, and CAP64, was generally induced in FBS, LIT, and DMEM media (Fig. S1), further supporting that CAP genes are required for capsule formation under all capsuleinducing conditions (11). Notably, the expression levels of CAP genes most robustly increased in the 10% FBS medium (Fig. S1). Therefore, we compared CAP gene expression using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) between the four TF mutants and the wild-type strain in FBS medium (Fig. 1B). The induction of CAP gene expression in FBS medium was markedly reduced in the gat201D, yap1D, bzp4D, and ada2D mutants (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that Gat201, Yap1, Bzp4, and Ada2 cooperate to induce CAP gene expression under capsule-inducing conditions.
Signaling networks of Gat201, Yap1, Bzp4 and Ada2 for capsule production. To identify potential epistatic relationships between GAT201, YAP1, BZP4, and ADA2 for capsule production, the expression levels of the four TF genes were measured in each deletion mutant in LIT and FBS media. GAT201 was strongly induced in both LIT and FBS media in the wild-type strain, but its induction significantly reduced in yap1D and ada2D mutants (Fig. 2A). YAP1 deletion more strongly reduced GAT201 induction than ADA2 deletion, suggesting that Yap1 and Ada2 play major and minor roles, respectively, in inducing GAT201 expression under capsule-induction conditions. In contrast, Bzp4 was dispensable for GAT201 induction in both the LIT and FBS media (Fig. 2A). Notably, YAP1, BZP4, and ADA2 were also induced by both LIT and FBS media in the wild-type strain, but unlike GAT201, their induction was not markedly affected by mutations in the other three TFs (Fig. 2B to D). Collectively, these results indicate that GAT201 induction in response to capsule-inducing conditions was regulated by Yap1 and Ada2, but BZP4, YAP1, and ADA2 were independently regulated.
To further elucidate the epistatic relationships between Gat201, Yap1, Bzp4, and Ada2, the following double mutant strains were constructed: yap1D ada2D, gat201D bzp4D, ada2D bzp4D, gat201D ada2D, and yap1D bzp4D. We examined capsule production levels in these double mutants in LIT and FBS media. In FBS medium, the yap1D ada2D mutants showed reduced capsule production compared with each single mutant (Fig. 2E and Fig. S2). Notably, the capsule production level of the yap1D ada2D mutant was almost equivalent to that of the gat201D mutant (Fig. 2E), further suggesting that Yap1 and Ada2 cooperate upstream of Gat201 for capsule induction. Supporting this finding, GAT201 induction in LIT and FBS media was more strongly reduced in yap1D ada2D mutants than in each

(A) Wild-type (WT) (H99S), cap10D (YSB4081), gat201D (YSB3300, YSB3301), yap1D (YSB815, YSB1290), bzp4D (YSB1894, YSB1895), and ada2D (YSB2381, YSB2382) strains were grown in yeast extractpeptone-dextrose (YPD) liquid medium at 30°C shaking incubator for 16 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and spotted onto a Littman's (LIT) solid medium and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) solid medium. Cells were incubated for an additional 2 days at 37°C. Each graph indicates relative capsule size of two independent transcription factor mutants which exhibited statistically significant changes in capsule production (630% difference relative to wild type as the cutoff). Three biologically independent experiments were performed, and representative data are shown here. Each measurement was repeated for 40 cells per condition. Error bars indicate standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni's multiple-comparison test. (*, P , 0.05; **, P , 0.01; ***, P , 0.001; ****, P , 0.0001). (B) The expression level of capsule-biosynthesis genes was determined using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) with cDNA from total RNA samples of WT (H99S), gat201D (YSB3300), yap1D (YSB815), bzp4D (YSB1895), and ada2D (YSB2382) strains grown in basal YPD medium and 10% FBS medium. CAP10, CAP59, CAP60, and CAP64 expression levels were normalized by actin gene (ACT1) expression.
Each strain grown in YPD medium (time zero sample) were resuspended in 10% FBS liquid medium and further incubated for 6 h. Three

gat201D mutant (Fig. 2E and Fig. S2). These results suggest that Bzp4 is regulated independently from Gat201 but may serve as a co-TF to support the full function of Gat201 in capsule formation.
To further confirm whether Gat201 works downstream of Yap1 and Ada2, we tested whether GAT201 overexpression (GAT201oe) can rescue capsule production defects in ada2D, yap1D, and yap1D ada2D mutant strains. To this end, we generated histone 3 (H3) promoter-driven GAT201 overexpression (GAT201oe) strains in the wild-type, ada2D, yap1D, and yap1D ada2D strain backgrounds (Fig. S2). The constitutively active H3 promoter was able to overexpress GAT201 by approximately 26- to 37-fold in the wild-type, ada2D, and yap1D strains (Fig. 2G). However, GAT201 overexpression levels were lower in the yap1D ada2D double mutants compared to those in the wild-type and ada2D and yap1D single-mutant strains (Fig. 2G), suggesting that Ada2 and Yap1 regulate GAT201 expression by affecting its mRNA stability. Strikingly, we found that GAT201oe dramatically enhanced capsule production in the wild-type strain and completely rescued capsule defects in the ada2D, yap1D, and ada2D yap1D mutants in both LIT and FBS media (Fig. 2H and Fig. S2). In fact, the capsule levels observed in the GAT201oe ada2D and GAT201oe yap1D strains were almost equivalent to those observed in the GAT201oe strain. These results further corroborate the hypothesis that Gat201 functions downstream of Yap1 and Ada2 to regulate capsule production.
Supporting the hypothesis that Yap1 and Ada2 cooperate to regulate Gat201, the ada2D bzp4D and yap1D bzp4D double mutants showed greater reductions in capsule production than each single mutant (Fig. 3A and 3B), consistent with the result that BZP4 induction was not regulated by Ada2 and Yap1 under capsule-inducing conditions (Fig. 2C). Notably, the gat201D ada2D mutants showed slightly more reduced capsule production in the LIT medium than the gat201D mutant (Fig. 3C), indicating that Ada2 may have some minor Gat201-independent roles in capsule production. Similarly, the yap1D gat201D mutants showed slightly more reduced capsule production in FBS medium than the gat201D mutant (Fig. 3D), indicating that Yap1 may have some Gat201-independent roles in capsule production.
Cellular localization of Bzp4, Yap1, Ada2, and Gat201 during capsule production. We recently reported that Bzp4 also serves as a major TF in melanin production (25). In response to nutrient starvation--a key melanin-inducing signaling pathway-- Bzp4 is translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, governing a plethora of downstream effector genes, including laccase (LAC1) (25). Therefore, we examined whether Bzp4 also localized in the nucleus in response to capsule-inducing signals. The bzp4D:: BZP4-mCherry strain with the mCherry protein fused in-frame to the C terminus of Bzp4 (25) partially restored capsule production compared with the bzp4D mutant (Fig. S3), indicating that Bzp4-mCherry was partially functional for capsule production. The Bzp4mCherry protein was distributed throughout the cell under basal conditions but was translocated to the nucleus within 2 h of transition to LIT medium (Fig. 4A).
We also constructed gat201D::GAT201-GFP and yap1D::YAP1-GFP, where the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused in-frame to the C terminus of Gat201 or Yap1, and

(Fig. 4C and D). To quantify GFP/mCherry expression, we measured the average fluorescence intensity of the whole cell and the nucleus and calculated its ratio. Supporting the qualitative data shown in Fig. 4A to D, we found that the relative nuclear fluorescence intensity of Bzp4-mCherry and Ada2-GFP significantly increased from ;0.9 to ;1.5 under capsule-inducing conditions (LIT medium). In contrast, the relative nuclear fluorescence intensities of Yap1-GFP and Gat201-GFP under basal conditions (YPD medium) were similar to those under capsule-inducing conditions (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that Bzp4 and Ada2, but not Gat201 and Yap1, translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during capsule production.
Upstream regulators of Gat201, Yap1, Bzp4, and Ada2 for capsule production. Next, we focused on the upstream signaling components which regulate the core TFs involved in capsule induction in C. neoformans. In our previous study, we found that 52 kinases were involved in capsule production in DMEM (22). To identify potential candidate kinases for the regulation of the four capsule-regulating TFs, we first measured the capsule production levels of the 52 kinase mutants in LIT and FBS media. Among these, seven kinase mutants (pka1D, bud32D, pos5D, ire1D, cdc2801D, hog1D, and irk5D) showed consistently altered capsule production levels in both LIT and FBS media (Pka1, Bud32, Pos5, Ire1, and Cdc2801 as positive regulators; Hog1 and Irk5 as negative regulators) (Fig. 5A). Therefore, we hypothesized that these seven kinases are potential upstream regulators of Gat201, Yap1, Bzp4, and Ada2.
Next, we measured the levels of GAT201, YAP1, ADA2, and BZP4 in kinase mutants under capsule-inducing conditions (Fig. 5B and Fig. S4). GAT201 induction was significantly reduced in the pka1D mutant in both LIT and FBS media (Fig. 5B). However, YAP1 and ADA2 induction remained largely unaltered in the pka1D mutant in LIT or FBS media (Fig. S4). We found that basal expression levels of ADA2 increased in the hog1D mutant (Fig. 5B), consistent with a previous report showing that Hog1 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) negatively regulates Ada2 (22). In contrast, BZP4 expression was markedly reduced in the irk5D mutant under capsule-inducing conditions (Fig. 5B). This was unexpected because the irk5D mutant produced more capsules than the wild-type strain (Fig. 5A). These results indicated that Irk5 may play both positive and negative roles in capsule production in C. neoformans.
Downstream networks of Gat201, Yap1, Bzp4, and Ada2 for capsule production. Next, we aimed to elucidate the downstream signaling network governed by capsule-inducing core TFs. We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based transcriptome analysis of wild-type and bzp4D, ada2D, and gat201D mutant strains under both basal and capsule-inducing conditions. We did not include the yap1D mutant in this analysis because Yap1 appeared to mainly act upstream of Gat201, and Yap1-dependent transcriptome profiles were partly reported (26). We also decided to use LIT medium rather than FBS for the capsule-inducing condition because LIT is a better defined medium than FBS. Because BZP4, ADA2, and GAT201 expression was highly induced after 2 h of incubation in LIT medium, we monitored the transcriptome profiles of wild-type, bzp4D, ada2D, and gat201D mutant cells grown to the mid-log phase in YPD medium (basal condition) and cells were subsequently incubated for 2 h in LIT medium. When wild-type cells were incubated for 2 h in LIT medium, we found that 1,631 genes were differentially regulated (cutoff: 2-fold change) at statistically significant levels (P , 0.05) (Fig. S5). The expression levels of genes involved in integral membrane components, transmembrane transporters, and carbohydrate metabolic processes significantly increased (Fig. S5), implying that polysaccharide capsule production and its transportation outside the cell actively occur under capsule-inducing conditions.
Principal-component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering of the heatmap clearly showed that a group of genes regulated by Gat201 and Ada2 under capsule-inducing conditions is highly correlated, but distinct from those regulated by Bzp4 (Fig. S6), further confirming the regulatory connection between Gat201 and Ada2. As previously reported (25), deletion of BZP4 did not significantly alter gene expression under basal conditions (seven upregulated and six downregulated genes; 2-fold change cutoff, P , 0.05). Similarly, deletion of GAT201 led to only a minor change in gene expression (26

upregulated and 63 downregulated genes) under basal conditions. However, ADA2 deletion resulted in marked changes in transcriptome profiles, even under basal conditions (80 upregulated and 330 downregulated genes) (Fig. 6A and B). This indicates that Bzp4 and Gat201 are not major transcriptional regulators required for growth under basal conditions. However, under capsule-inducing conditions, deletion of BZP4 led to a dramatic change in transcriptome profiles (1,051 upregulated and 1,155 downregulated genes) (Fig. 6B), reflecting that Bzp4 is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus under capsule-inducing conditions. In contrast, deletion of GAT201 controlled a smaller number of genes (128 upregulated and 180 downregulated genes) under capsule-inducing conditions. Deletion of ADA2 regulated an intermediate number of genes (282 upregulated and 551 downregulated genes) under capsule-inducing conditions (Fig. 6B). Through KEGG pathway analysis, we found that Bzp4 is involved in more diverse metabolic pathways than Ada2 or Gat201 under capsule-inducing conditions (Fig. 6C). In particular, the expression of pathway genes associated with the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites decreased significantly, which is expected to be associated with the decrease in polysaccharide synthesis involved in capsule formation (Fig. 6C). In addition, the expression of

genes involved in carbon metabolism decreased in bzp4D, ada2D, and gat201D mutant strains under capsule-induction conditions, which is expected to reduce the synthesis of polysaccharides required for capsule formation, resulting in decreased capsule formation (Fig. 6C).
Next, we addressed how Bzp4, Ada2, and Gat201 control the expression of genes involved in capsule biosynthesis, attachment, and cell wall remodeling (Fig. 7). More than 77 proteins involved in these processes have been identified (4). We found that deletion of BZP4, ADA2, or GAT201 generally decreased the expression of capsule biosynthesis-related genes but did not affect the expression of capsule attachment and cell wall remodeling-related genes under capsule-inducing conditions (LIT medium) (Fig. 7). Interestingly, despite the more critical roles of Gat201 in capsule production than those of Bzp4 and Ada2, Bzp4 regulated more capsule biosynthesis genes than Ada2 and Gat201 (Fig. 7A). In particular, CAS3 was downregulated in the bzp4D, ada2D, and gat201D mutants (Fig. 7A). CAS3 is a capsule-related protein involved in the formation of GXM; therefore, a decrease in gene expression would have decreased capsule thickness in the mutant strains. In contrast, the expression of two chitin deacetylase genes, CDA1 and CDA2, was commonly regulated in the bzp4D, ada2D, and gat201D mutants (Fig. 7B), indicating that these three TFs may play a role in chitin and chitosan homeostasis in C. neoformans. It has been previously reported that decreased chitosan levels are connected to increased capsule production (27). Collectively, these data further suggest that Bzp4, Ada2, and Gat201 govern capsule formation by C. neoformans by positively and negatively regulating the expression of various capsule biosynthesis and chitin/chitosan synthesis genes, respectively.
DISCUSSION In this study, we elucidated complex signaling networks that regulate the produc-
tion of the capsule, a key virulence factor for C. neoformans (Fig. 8). We found that four core TFs, Gat201, Yap1, Bzp4, and Ada2, play pivotal roles in the induction of CAP (CAP10, CAP59, CAP60, and CAP64) and other capsule-related genes. Notably, Yap1 and Ada2 function upstream of Gat201, whereas Bzp4 and Gat201 regulate capsule production independently. As upstream regulators, Pka1 and Irk5 regulate the induction of

GAT201 and BZP4, respectively, under capsule induction conditions, whereas Hog1 negatively regulates Ada2.
Based on its significant role in capsule biosynthesis, the role of the four capsule-regulating TFs in the pathogenicity of C. neoformans has been previously reported (12, 14). The ada2D mutant showed reduced virulence in a murine model of systemic cryptococcosis (28) and yap1D mutants showed significantly reduced virulence in an insect-killing model (22). Deletion of GAT201 reduces the virulence and infectivity of C. neoformans (22). However, other virulence factors could contribute to the reduced virulence and/or infectivity of the ada2D, yap1D, and gat201D mutants. Notably, all of these mutants show reduced resistance to oxidative, osmotic, and membrane stress (22, 26). Bzp4 is positively involved in the production of two major virulence factors, melanin and capsule, but is dispensable for general stress resistance, virulence in the insect host, and murine infectivity (25). However, its pathogenic potential has not been fully examined in a classical murine-based virulence assay. One possibility is that the residual capsule and melanin levels in the bzp4D mutant are sufficient to maintain its virulence. Another possibility is that other unidentified virulence factor(s) are enhanced in the bzp4D mutant. These possibilities need to be investigated in future studies.
Among the capsule-inducing core TFs, Gat201, a GATA family TF, appears to play the most important role, because its deletion led to the most dramatic decrease in capsule production. Yap1 and Ada2 are likely two major upstream regulators of Gat201, because deletion of both YAP1 and ADA2 almost abolished GAT201 induction, GAT201 overexpression completely rescued capsule defects in YAP1 and ADA2 deletion mutants, and the yap1D ada2D mutant was defective in capsule production, like the gat201D mutant. Supporting this, the transcriptome profiles of the gat201D and ada2D

Cryptococcal Capsule-Regulating Pathways
mutants under capsule-inducing conditions were highly correlated. Yap1 is a bZIP-containing AP-1-like TF that is generally involved in oxidative stress response (26). Ada2 is a member of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase complex which regulates the transcription of stress response genes via histone acetylation, collaborating with other TFs (29). Notably, deletion of Pka1 significantly reduced the induction level of GAT201, but not those of YAP1 and ADA2, suggesting that the cAMP/PKA pathway may also independently control the Gat201-dependent pathway. These data also suggest that the marked capsule defects observed in the cAMP/PKA mutants are likely caused by the reduced expression of Gat201. RNAseq-based transcriptome analysis revealed several additional TFs downstream of Gat201, including Gat204 (Data Set S1 and Fig. S7). gat204D mutants exhibited fewer defects in capsule production than gat201D mutants (Fig. S7), suggesting that Gat204 likely governs the subset of Gat201-dependent genes, consistent with previously reported data (30).
The basal ADA2 expression levels increased in the hog1D mutant, indicating that Hog1 negatively regulates Ada2, consistent with our previous microarray data, which also reported that Hog1 positively regulates Atf1 and Zfc3 (31). Supporting this, deletion of HOG1 markedly increased capsule production (21). However, during capsuleinducing conditions, ADA2 induction levels were almost equivalent in both the wildtype and hog1D mutant strains, and capsule induction of atf1D and zfc3D increased under some capsule-inducing conditions, implying that Hog1 controls capsule production through downstream factors such as Atf1, Zfc3, and Ada2.
Our results showed that Bzp4 positively regulated capsule production in a Gat201/ Yap1/Ada2-independent manner. The induction of BZP4 during capsule induction is positively controlled by Irk5 (infectivity-related kinase 5). Because deletion of IRK5 led to highly increased capsule production, other downstream TFs besides Bzp4 work downstream of Irk5. Our previous analysis of the melanin-regulating signaling network revealed that the homeobox TF Hob1 is the major upstream regulator of Bzp4 in melanin production (25). However, the fact that the hob1D mutant is not defective in capsule production suggests that Bzp4 is controlled by different upstream regulators depending on external signals. Nevertheless, the fact that all these signaling components, Irk5, Hob1, and Bzp4, are not evolutionarily conserved in other fungi suggests that this signaling pathway has been uniquely developed in C. neoformans. Although Gat201 and Bzp4 are independently controlled, it is possible that these two TFs cooperate to regulate capsule production, because the deletion of BZP4 did not further decrease capsule production in the gat201D mutant. Future studies must focus on how Gat201 and Bzp4 cooperate in capsule production.
Our RNA-seq data showed that Bzp4, Gat201, and Ada2 controlled the expression of genes involved in diverse primary and secondary metabolite pathways and capsule synthesis and attachment processes. In general, genes involved in capsule biosynthesis were positively regulated by the three TFs, whereas those involved in capsule attachment and cell wall remodeling, such as chitin/chitosan synthesis genes, were negatively regulated. The finding that Bzp4 positively regulated the expression of a larger number of capsule biosynthesis genes than Gat201 was unexpected, because capsule defects were more pronounced in the gat201D mutant than in the bzp4D mutant. Therefore, in addition to controlling the expression of capsule biosynthesis genes, Gat201 may also indirectly affect capsule production. The role of Bzp4, Gat201, and Ada2 in the expression of chitin and chitosan synthesis genes also appeared to be associated with capsule defects in TF mutants. In C. neoformans, Chs3 (chitin synthase 3) produces chitin that is subsequently converted to chitosan (4). Reportedly, the deletion of two chitin deacetylase genes, CDA1 and CDA2, or CHS3 increased chitin levels but decreased chitosan levels and enhanced capsule production (27). This may be because increased chitosan masks the capsule attachment sites and inhibits encapsulation (4). Our findings that CDA1 and CDA2 expression were upregulated in bzp4D, gat201D, and ada2D mutants and CHS3 expression was upregulated in bzp4D and ada2D mutants support this idea. However, the quantification of chitosan levels in the

wild-type and capsule-defective TF mutant strains showed no significant differences (Fig. S8). Therefore, differential chitosan levels are unlikely to contribute to the reduced capsule production in TF mutants. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility of the involvement of Bzp4, Gat201, and Ada2 in capsule attachment and cell wall remodeling. This topic should be further studied in the future.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that Bzp4, Ada2, Yap1, and Gat201 are core TFs which play pivotal roles in capsule production in C. neoformans. Because the capsule is one of the major virulence factors in C. neoformans, therapeutic strategies targeting these signaling pathways could be a reasonable option for the development of anticryptococcal drugs. Bzp4 and Gat201 could be better therapeutic targets because they are more evolutionarily divergent than other TFs and are the two major capsule-regulating TFs. For this, the upstream and downstream networks of Bzp4 and Gat201 need to be functionally characterized in future studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains of Cryptococcus neoformans and capsule induction conditions. The C. neoformans strains used in this study are listed in Table S1. The strains were cultured and maintained in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium. For the capsule production assay, the strains were inoculated into 2 mL of YPD broth and cultured overnight at 30°C in a shaking incubator. Cells were spun down, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 1 mL PBS. Each strain was spotted (5 mL) on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Littman's medium, and 10% fetal bovine serum agar medium. Cells were further incubated for 48 h at 37°C. After incubation, the capsule was visualized by staining with India ink and observed under a microscope. Quantitative measurement of capsule size was performed by microscopically measuring the diameters of the capsule and cell using SPOT Advanced version 4.6 software.
Gene disruption and complementation. The gene deletion mutants used in this study were produced as follows. L1-L2 and R1-R2 primer pairs (Table S1) were used in the first round of PCR. The NEO selection marker was amplified with M13 forward extended (M13Fe) and M13 reverse extended (M13Re) primers using a plasmid containing the NEO gene as a template. The first-round PCR products of the flanking regions and NEO markers were purified together and used as the templates for the second double joint-PCR (DJ-PCR). In the second round of PCR, the 59- and 39-gene disruption cassettes containing split NEO selection markers were amplified using L1-split primer 2 and R2-split primer 1, respectively (Table S1). To perform biolistic transformation, background strains were cultured in YPD medium at 30°C in a shaking incubator for 16 h. The cultured cells were centrifuged, spread on YPD agar medium containing 1 M sorbitol, and further incubated at 30°C for 4 h. The dried disruption cassettes were deposited onto 0.6-mm gold micro carrier beads (Bio-Rad), delivered into the cells on YPD 1 1 M sorbitol agar plates using a particle delivery system (PDS-100, Bio-Rad), and incubated at 30°C for 4 h. Subsequently, the incubated cells were recovered using a scraper, spread on YPD agar medium containing 50 mg/mL G418, and incubated at 30°C until colonies appeared on plates. G418-resistant colonies were picked and restreaked on fresh YPD 1 G418 plates. Positive transformants were confirmed using diagnostic PCR with B79-SO primers and verified using Southern blot analysis.
Construction of complemented strains. To verify the phenotypes of the bzp4D, gat201D, yap1D mutants, the bzp4D::BZP4-mChrry, gat201D::GAT201-GFP, and yap1D::YAP1-GFP complemented strains were constructed as follows. First, the full-length BZP4, GAT201, and YAP1 genes were amplified using PCR with H99 genomic DNA as the template and directly cloned into the TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to generate the plasmids pTOP-BZP4, pTOP-GAT201, and pTOP-YAP1. After confirmation of the DNA sequence, the BZP4, GAT201, and YAP1 inserts were subcloned into the plasmid pNEO-RFPhog1t (YSBE524) or pNEO-GFPhog1t (YSB508) to produce the plasmids pNEO-BZP4-mCherry, pNEO-GAT201GFP, and pNEO-YAP1-GFP. For targeted reintegration of the BZP4-mCherry, GAT201-GFP, and YAP1-GFP alleles into their native loci, pNEO-BZP4-mCherry, pNEO-GAT201-GFP, and pNEO-YAP1-GFP were linearized by AflII, MfeI, and PmlI (New England Biolabs) digestion and introduced into the bzp4D, gat201D, and yap1D mutants using biolistic transformation. The correct genotype of the bzp4D::BZP4-mChrry, gat201D::GAT201-GFP, and yap1D::YAP1-GFP complemented strains was confirmed using diagnostic PCR.
Construction of GAT201 overexpression strains. To generate the GAT201 constitutive overexpression strain, the native promoter of GAT201 was replaced with the histone H3 promoter using an amplified homologous recombination cassette (Fig. S2C). The primer pairs B17609, B17610 and B17611, B17612 were used for amplification of the native promoter and 59 coding regions (from ATG), respectively, of GAT201 in the first round of PCR. The hygromycin resistance gene (HYG)-H3 promoter region was amplified with the primer pair B4017, B4018. In the second-round PCR, the 59 region of the PH3: GAT201 cassette was amplified by DJ-PCR using the mixed templates of the native promoter region of GAT201 and the 59 region of the HYG-H3 promoter region with the primer pair B17609, B5752 (Table S1). The 39 region of the PH3:GAT201 cassette was similarly amplified by using the mixed templates of the 59 coding region of GAT201 and the 39 region of the HYG-H3 promoter region with the primer pair B5751, B17612. Next, the combined split PH3:GAT201 cassettes were introduced into the wild-type (H99S), yap1D (YSB815), ada2D (YSB2381), and yap1D ada2D (YSB6054) strains by biolistic transformation. Stable transformants were selected on YPD medium containing 300 mg/mL hygromycin B. Positive transformants were confirmed using diagnostic PCR with a primer pair (B2931/B79).

Cryptococcal Capsule-Regulating Pathways
Capsule production assay. For capsule induction, each strain was incubated for 16 h at 30°C in liquid YPD medium. The cultured cells were washed with PBS, spotted (5 mL) onto DMEM, LIT, or 10% FBS solid medium and further incubated for 48 h at 37°C. After incubation, the capsule was visualized by staining with India ink and observed under a microscope. Quantitative measurement of capsule size was performed by microscopically measuring the diameters of the capsule and cell using SPOT Advanced version 4.6 software.
Assessment of cellular localization of tagged strains under capsule-inducing conditions. bzp4D::BZP4-mCherry (YSB5408), gat201D::GAT201-GFP (YSB6745), yap1D::YAP1-GFP (YSB2723), and ADA2-GFP (YSB3405) were cultured in 50 mL of YPD liquid medium at 30°C in a shaking incubator for 16 h and subcultured in fresh YPD liquid medium until the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.6 to 0.8. Subcultured cells were washed with PBS and suspended in 40 mL LIT medium. After suspension, cells were incubated in a 37°C shaking incubator, a portion (1 mL) was sampled at each time point (1, 2, and 4 h), and the cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were stained with Hoechst for nuclear staining and observed using differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence microscopy.
Total RNA preparation and qRT-PCR. The WT and mutant strains were inoculated into 50 mL of YPD broth and cultured overnight at 30°C in a shaking incubator. Cells were subcultured in 80 mL of fresh YPD broth until the OD600 reached 0.6 to 0.8. The subcultured cells were then washed with PBS and suspended in 40 mL of LIT liquid medium. After suspension, the cells were incubated in a 37°C shaking incubator for 2 h, centrifuged, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized. Total RNA was isolated via the TRIzol extraction method using Easy-Blue (Intron). Total RNA from each strain was purified using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized with reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using purified total RNA. Gene (CAP10, CAP59, CAP60, CAP64, GAT201, YAP1, BZP4, and ADA2) expression was analyzed using qRT-PCR with specific primer pairs (Table S1) and the CFX96TM Real-Time system (BioRad). ACT1 expression was used as a normalization control. Statistical differences between samples were analyzed using a Student's t test.
RNA-seq and data analysis. Transcriptome patterns of the H99S, bzp4D, ada2D, and gat201D strains were comparatively analyzed using RNA sequencing. C. neoformans strains were grown at 30°C for 16 h in YPD medium, transferred to 50 mL of fresh YPD medium, and incubated at 30°C until the OD600 reached 0.8. Half of the cells were further incubated in LIT liquid medium for 2 h. Cells were harvested using centrifugation and lyophilized. Total RNAs was prepared as described above and purified using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). The concentration was measured using Quant-IT RiboGreen (Invitrogen). RNA quality was verified using a TapeStation RNA Screentape (Agilent). Cultured samples were prepared independently thrice. A cDNA library was constructed with 1 mg total RNAs for each sample using the Illumina TruSeq mRNA library kit (Illumina) and sequenced on the Illumina platform. The adapter sequences were trimmed from the sequencing reads using Cutadapt v3.4 with Python 3.7.4. (32). The reference genome sequence of C. neoformans H99 and annotation data derived from the Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA) were downloaded from the NCBI FTP server. The reads were aligned to the C. neoformans H99 genome sequence using Hisat2 v2.2.1, with the HISAT and Bowtie2 algorithm, and processed as previously described (33). Hisat2 was performed using the "-p 30" and "- dta -1" options, with the other parameters set to default. Aligned reads were converted and then sorted using Samtools v1.9 (34) with the "-Sb -@ 8" option for converting, the "-@ 20 -m 2000000000" option for sorting, and the other parameters set to default. Transcript assembly and abundance estimation were performed using Stringtie v2.1.1 with the "-p 12" and "-B" options to run the Ballgown analysis (35). The assembled transcripts were merged into a single GTF file, and the relative transcript abundance was calculated using fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM). The FPKM and read-count matrix were generated using the R package "isoformswitchanalyzerR" and analyzed using DESeq2 (36, 37). Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis was performed using DESeq2 v1.24.0 with default settings using Ballgown. The volcano plot was illustrated using R v4.1.0 and the R package "EnhancedVolcano" (38) with a cutoff of more than 2-fold change (P , 0.05). A PCA plot was generated using the R package "DeBrowser" and a heatmap was generated using the R package (39). KEGG pathway analysis was performed using the R package "Cluster profiler" (40) after changing the H99S gene locus ID to JEC21 ortholog locus ID. The list of differentially expressed genes is provided in Data Set S1 in the supplemental material.
Measurement of chitosan content in cell walls. The chitosan content of the wild-type and mutant cells was quantified using a 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone (MBTH)-based chemical assay with some modifications (41, 42). Cells were cultured in 50 mL liquid YPD in a shaking incubator for 48 h at 30°C, collected by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS (pH 7.5), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized. Lyophilized cells were resuspended in 6% KOH, incubated at 80°C for 30 min with occasional tapping to eliminate nonspecific MBTH-reactive molecules, washed three times with PBS (pH 7.5) to neutralize the pH, resuspended in PBS, sonicated for 30 s, and adjusted to a final concentration of OD600 = 1.0. For the MBTH assay, 0.1 mL of the sample was mixed with an equal volume of 1 M HCl, heated at 110°C for 2 h, transferred to a 25°C water bath for cooling, and supplemented with 2.5% NaNO2. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, supplemented with 200 mL of 12.5% ammonium sulfamate, and incubated for another 5 min at room temperature. Next, 200 mL of 0.25% MBTH was added to each sample, followed by 30 min incubation at 37°C, addition of 200 mL 0.5% FeCl3, and another 5 min incubation at 37°C. Finally, the optical density of each sample was measured at 595 nm.
Data availability. RNA-seq data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession no. GSE208163). We will provide any strains and materials used in this study upon request.

ABSTRACT
Objective: Various hematologic side effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination has been reported, and most of them are thought to be related to autoimmune pathways. To the best of our knowledge, only few cases of post-COVID-19 vaccination aplastic anemia (AA) have been reported and there is no reported Korean case of COVID-19 vaccine-induced AA yet. We present a case of severe immune-mediated AA that developed after the administration of a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) gene-based spike protein vaccine against COVID-19, which responded well to immunosuppressive therapy, and discuss the probable pathogenesis of AA and the implication of vaccination along with a comparison of previous cases reported. Methods: A 53-year-old Korean man developed sudden pancytopenia three months after COVID-19 vaccination. To evaluate the cause of pancytopenia, a bone marrow study was performed. Results: A diagnosis of AA was made through the bone marrow study and he received triple immunosuppressive therapy (IST). After triple IST for five months, his blood cell count was improved and maintained without transfusion and his follow-up bone marrow examination showed improved cellularity. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccine might be associated with the development of immunemediated AA. Prompt hematologic evaluation should be performed when there are symptoms or signs suggestive of cytopenia after COVID-19 vaccination. Although the clinical outcome of post-vaccination AA varies, a good prognosis can be possible for patients with COVID-19 vaccination-induced AA.

Introduction
About a year after the start of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination, safety concerns regarding the vaccine have been raised continuously. The hematologic side effects of COVID-19 vaccination include immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and the aggravation of pre-existing hematologic diseases such as paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria (PNH) [1-7]. Almost all hematologic manifestations after COVID-19 vaccination in previous studies were thought to be related to autoimmune pathways.
In the majority of sporadic cases, severe and acute aplastic anemia (AA) appear to be immune-mediated [8]. A few studies reported post-vaccination AA [9,10]. To the best of our knowledge, few cases of post-COVID-19 vaccination AA have been reported [1,11-13]. However, a Korean case of COVID-19

vaccine-induced AA has not been reported yet. Here, we present a case of very severe immune-mediated AA that developed after the administration of an mRNA gene-based spike protein vaccine against COVID-19 that responded well to immunosuppressive therapy. In addition, the probable pathogenesis of post-COVID-19 vaccination AA and the implications of vaccination are discussed.
Case description
A 53-year-old man was admitted to a tertiary hospital because of bruises on both legs and melena in November 2021. He had no remarkable past or family history. He was not taking any medications. He received the first Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in August 2021 and the second vaccine in September 2021. He first noted the sudden onset of bruises two weeks after the first

vaccine dose. He also noticed continuous bleeding
after shaving after the second vaccine dose. His most recent complete blood cell counts (CBC) before COVID-19 vaccination (three months before vacci-
nation) were normal (hemoglobin (Hb), 14.0 g/dL (reference range: 13.0-17.5 g/dL); white blood cells (WBC), 4.51 × 109 /L (reference range: 4.0-10.0 × 109 /L); platelets (PLT), 160 × 109 /L (reference range: 150-450 × 109 /L), and he had no symptoms of cytopenia before vaccination. CBC analysis at admission showed the following results: Hb, 6.6 g/dL (reference range: 13.0-18.0 g/dL); WBC, 1.92 × 109 /L (reference range: 4.0-10.0 × 109 /L); absolute neutrophil count (ANC), 0.12 × 109 /L (reference range: 1.4-7.5 × 109 /L); PLT, 2 × 109 /L (reference range: 150-400 × 109 /L); and absolute reticulocytes, 10.6 × 109 /L (reference range: 24-84 × 109 /L), with normal mean corpuscular volume (94.3 fL). All other blood tests (including serum bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, vitamins, and iron status) and coagulation tests were within the normal ranges. The peripheral blood smear showed
no abnormal immature cells such as blasts or nucleated red blood cells (RBCs). RBC morphology was not remarkable. Serologic tests for hepatitis viruses and human immunodeficiency virus and autoimmune tests were all negative except for cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunoglobulin G (IgG). The bone marrow
(BM) examination showed markedly hypocellular marrow (less than 5% cellularity) without any morphologic abnormalities or increases in the number of blasts (Fig. 1A). The cytogenetic results were 45,X,-Y[4]/46,XY,

t(11;14)(p10;p10)[3]/46,XY[13]. Flow cytometric analysis showed no definite PNH clones (0.02% RBC, 0.14% granulocytes, and 0.60% monocytes; all were within the reference ranges of the local laboratory). The diagnosis of very severe aplastic anemia was made. The patient received triple immunosuppressive therapy (IST: anti-thymocyte globulin (rabbit) 260 mg/day for 5 days, cyclosporin A 700 mg/day for 15 days, 800 mg for the next 10 days, 1200 mg for the next 2 days, 1400 mg for the next 2 days, 700 mg for the next 10 days, 500 mg for the next 10 days, 300 mg for the next 150 days, and eltrombopag 75 mg/day for 180 days), and his blood cyclosporin level was continuously maintained within the therapeutic range (150-300 ng/mL). During triple IST, he experienced Escherichia coli sepsis and CMV colitis. However, he recovered after appropriate antibiotic and antiviral therapy. At the last follow-up (April 2022), he was still maintained on triple IST. He showed improved blood counts (Hb 10.3 g/dL, ANC 1.01 × 109 /L, and PLT 219 × 109 /L) without transfusion. His follow-up BM examination showed improved cellularity (from 5% to 30%, average: 15%) (Fig. 1B). The patient never experienced COVID-19 during his hospital course.
Discussion
Until now, several hematologic adverse effects from COVID-19 vaccinations have been reported, with variable severity and outcomes [1-7,9,10]. The precise cause of hematologic adverse effects, mostly

cytopenia, is currently unclear. However, most studies have suggested an underlying immunologic mechanism [2-4,6,14,15]. The triggering of autoimmune responses to host proteins has been considered a mechanism in the development of COVID-19 vaccineinduced thrombotic thrombocytopenia [6]. A similar mechanism of AA after COVID-19 vaccination was proposed in previous reports [1,11]. The current literature revealed a few hypotheses regarding the relationship between spike protein received in mRNA vaccines and adverse effects [16]. There are possible interactions between spike protein and several intra-/extracellular signaling pathways, which result in various post-vaccination adverse effects [16]. According to proteomic analysis, severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein could bind to hemoglobin and its metabolites, and lead to further adverse medical diseases [16,17]. A previous study reported a possible association between AA relapse and COVID-19 vaccination [12]. In that study, enhanced CD8+ T-cell-dependent activation and immunemediated response to an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine were suggested as mechanisms for the increased AA relapse risk.
Secondary AA can be caused by infections, drugs, or various diseases. The pathophysiology and treatment of AA are somewhat different depending upon the cause [8]. For example, cytotoxic drugs can damage marrow chemically and physically. Treatment for such damage includes supportive care, hematopoietic growth factors, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [8]. Idiopathic and various immuneassociated diseases can destroy marrow immunologically. Such destruction can be treated by immunosuppressive therapy and HSCT [8]. Our patient responded well to conventional immunosuppressive therapy for AA and maintained tolerable blood counts without transfusions several months after diagnosis, further supporting the autoimmune mechanism of AA stimulated by the COVID-19 vaccine [8]. This is the strongest evidence for an immune mechanism of AA after COVID-19 vaccination.
In our patient, bruising started two weeks after the first dose of vaccine, and bleeding started just after the second dose of vaccine. According to the literature, spike protein can circulate in the blood from one hour after mRNA vaccination, and the serologic response arises about three weeks after vaccination [16]. Measuring the blood spike protein antigen titer could have helped to elucidate the mechanism of AA in our patient, although false-negative results can be seen since the spike protein is a modified antigen and all testing involves the initial antigen [18]. However, the test was not performed. Based on the current literature, the possible cause of AA in our patient may have been an interaction with spike protein, a serologic response, or both when

considering the time that the hematologic symptoms occurred. In this case, we should also consider the possibility that this was a spike protein-derived temporal condition mimicking AA. However, since our patient responded well to immunosuppressive treatment for AA, we thought that the possibility of true and definite AA caused by the above-mentioned possible mechanisms was high.
It was also necessary to determine whether or not AA was already present. Before vaccination, our patient had no history of infection, drug intake, or other possible causes of AA. According to the literature, the first symptoms related to cytopenia or the first CBC abnormalities were reported as early as the day following vaccination, and as late as three months after [1,11-13]. AA was usually diagnosed 1- 2 weeks after receiving other forms of vaccines [9,19]. Our patient's blood test results were normal three months before vaccination, but he experienced the sudden onset of bruising two weeks after the first vaccination and was diagnosed with AA two months after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Our patient's timeline is consistent with that of other patients reported in the literature [1,11-13]. Therefore, this case was most likely COVID-19 vaccine-induced AA rather than the expression of pre-existing disease.
In our patient, the chromosomal abnormality t (11;14)(p10;p10) was found. Generally, the t (11;14)(q13;q32) abnormality can be found in plasma cell myeloma and other hematologic malignancies, but there was no evidence of other hematologic malignancies, including myeloma, in the patient's bone marrow study. The t(11;14)(p10;p10) abnormality has not been reported to be associated with any specific hematologic malignancies. No specific genes have been identified in this location but clonal mosaicism of the chromosome has been found in many normal tissues. Some benign clonal populations are common in AA [8]. Therefore, the significance of this chromosomal abnormality was inconclusive. Close bone marrow study follow-ups and chromosomal analysis should be done to evaluate the clinical significance of a chromosomal abnormality. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can detect mutations associated with myeloid malignancies in nearly 20% of the patients with AA [20]. Unfortunately, we could not perform an NGS study. However, a genetic abnormality is not an essential requirement for the diagnosis of AA. Therefore, we could diagnose AA in our patient.
The clinical and laboratory characteristics of the cases reported so far, as well as those in our case, are summarized in Table 1 [1,11-13]. All reported patients were males who had received an mRNA gene-based spike protein vaccine against COVID-19. The onset time varied from one day to 2-3 months after vaccination. However, our patient experienced the sudden

onset of bruising two weeks after the first vaccination. Therefore, the onset time was thought to be within one month after vaccination. The severity of AA after COVID-19 vaccination was severe without definite PNH clones. However, the clinical course of each case was different. The three previously reported patients showed insufficient responses to IST, and one patient expired. Actually, the only curative treatment for AA is HSCT. It is always the preferred treatment, especially in a young patient with immune aplastic anemia [8]. However, IST is the standard treatment modality for older patients who do not undergo HSCT. About 20- 30% of the patients who responded to IST showed a complete response [8]. Contrary to the two previously reported patients, our patient responded well to IST. He maintained an improved blood count without transfusion. His bone marrow cellularity also improved. It is currently unclear which factors contributed to these prognostic differences. Different vaccine manufacturers and/or chromosomal abnormalities might have contributed to the differences in the clinical courses. Therefore, the possibility of a good prognosis in patients with immune-mediated AA after COVID-19 vaccination could be considered, although there was insufficient information to develop a comprehensive theory.

In conclusion, the COVID-19 vaccine might be associated with the development of immunemediated cytopenia and/or AA. Prompt hematologic evaluation should be performed when there are symptoms or signs suggestive of cytopenia after COVID-19 vaccination. Although the clinical outcomes of patients with post-vaccination AA varied from insufficient recovery despite appropriate medical treatment and HSCT to hematologic improvement with only medical treatment, patients with COVID-19 vaccination-induced AA may have good prognoses. The exact factors contributing to the differences in clinical outcomes are currently unknown. Further studies with large and prospective cohorts are needed to determine the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and AA.
