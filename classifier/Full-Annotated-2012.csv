ABSTRACT,0,,False
"We present the ChatNoir search engine which indexes the entire English part of the ClueWeb09 corpus. Besides Carnegie Mellon's Indri system, ChatNoir is the second publicly available search engine for this corpus. It implements the classic BM25F information retrieval model including PageRank and spam likelihood. The search engine is scalable and returns the first results within three seconds, which is significantly faster than Indri. A convenient API allows for implementing reproducible experiments based on retrieving documents from the ClueWeb09 corpus. The search engine has successfully accomplished a load test involving 100 000 queries.",1,ClueWeb,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Many of the current TREC tracks and TREC style retrieval performance experiments are based on the ClueWeb09 corpus--a collection of 1 billion web pages crawled and provided by the Carnegie Mellon University. As indexing and searching such a large corpus requires a decent amount of hardware probably not available to all researchers interested in TREC style experiments or TREC participation, a public search engine has been provided with the release of the corpus.1 So far, this is the only publicly available search engine for the ClueWeb09 and it has been used in many TREC runs over the last years. However, the engine is rather slow (answer time of about 10 seconds or more) and only offers the Indri retrieval model (language modeling combined with an inference network). As an alternative, we provide a faster public search engine--ChatNoir.",1,TREC,True

"The ChatNoir search engine is based on the classic BM25F retrieval model [4] including the anchor text list provided by the University of Twente [3], the PageRank list provided by the Carnegie Mellon University,2 and the spam rank list provided by the University of Waterloo [1]. ChatNoir also incorporates an approximate proximity feature with variable width buckets as described by Elsayed et al. [2].

"The web interface of ChatNoir is similar to that of commercial search engines (snippets, phrasal search, etc.). As for query processing, non-phrasal queries are handled by a 1-gram index of the ClueWeb09 built with Hadoop. Phrasal queries are handled by a 2gram index and a 3-gram exact position index. For phrase queries containing only 2-grams, the 2-gram index suffices. For phrase queries with longer phrases, the 2-gram index is used to identify documents that contain all 2-grams of a longer phrase while merging the postlists with the 3-gram positional index finally identifies the documents that contain the exact searched phrase. To ensure fast answer times, long queries with more than 2 keywords or phrases are treated in a divide-and-conquer manner. The long query is split into sub-queries for which a parallel retrieval is conducted. The parallel results are then merged into just one list.",1,ClueWeb,True
The ChatNoir engine runs on a cluster of 10 standard quad-core PCs and 2 eight-core servers. It comes with a web interface and a developer API at chatnoir.webis.de. This is the first public alternative to Carnegie Mellon's Indri search for reproducible experiments on the ClueWeb09 without the need of an own cluster for indexing/searching. A load test with 100 000 unique queries from a commercial search engine log showed the robustness and scalability of ChatNoir. The first ten results are typically shown within three seconds compared to more than ten seconds for an Indri search.,1,ad,True
3. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK,0,,False
With our ChatNoir search engine we provide the second public API for reproducibly searching the ClueWeb09 corpus in TREC style experiments. ChatNoir's much faster BM25F based search offers an alternative to the available Indri retrieval model.,1,AP,True
"A first use case we are currently handling with ChatNoir is the international PAN competition for automatic plagiarism detection. Therefore, paid human individuals write short reports on TREC topics plagiarizing parts from ClueWeb09 documents found via ChatNoir searches.

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Many information retrieval (IR) techniques have been proposed to improve the performance, and some combinations of these techniques has been demonstrated to be effective. However, how to effectively combine them is largely unexplored. It is possible that a method reduces the positive influence of the other one even if both of them are effective separately. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid model which can simply and flexibly combine components of three different IR techniques under a uniform framework. Extensive experiments on the TREC standard collections indicate that our proposed model can outperform the best TREC systems consistently in the ad-hoc retrieval. It shows that the combination strategy in our proposed model is very effective. Meanwhile, this method is also re-useable for other researchers to test whether their new methods are additive to the current technologies.",1,TREC,True

"In the past thirty years, researchers make great progress in the Information Retrieval (IR) area. A plenty of new technologies, e.g., stemming, query expansion and smoothing methods, have been introduced and help to obtain better performance in retrieving relevant documents. Some attempts to combine these technologies show that the strategy of combination is very important because one technology can counteract the affects of others. However, how to make an effective combination is still largely unexplored, especially under a unified framework.",0,,False

"We analyze the best TREC systems for ad-hoc retrieval, and extend the Rocchio's feedback method by incorporating three kinds of IR techniques, which are proximity, feedback document quality estimation and query performance prediction techniques, under the pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) framework to boost the overall performance. We mainly focus on how to refine the representation of the query under the PRF framework in order to avoid the drawbacks of traditional PRF methods. Experimental results on various TREC datasets show that our hybrid model consistently obtains better results over the best TREC systems. Because our proposed model is component-based, it is very flexible to import different techniques in the future. Meanwhile, the hybrid model can help researchers to test whether their methods are additive to improve the overall performance of ad-hoc retrieval which was mentioned in [1].",1,TREC,True

Meanwhile, it is very flexible to adapt additional components. However, the traditional Rocchio's model can still be reformed to be better. First, the query term proximity information which has proven to be useful is not considered. Second, Rocchio's algorithm views terms from different feedback documents equally. Intuitively, a candidate expansion term in a document with better quality is more likely to be relevant to the query topic. Third, the interpolation parameter  is always fixed across a group of queries. In fact, for a well expressed query, the candidate feedback documents are always more reliable for relevance feedback.

In other words, there is still room for improvement if the parameters are tuned on a collection-by-collection basis. Particularly, for the basic retrieval model, we use the Okapi BM25 model, and set b in BM25 to 0.3. When only the query term proximity technique is added, denoted as ""BM25+Prox"", we set  to 0.3. In addition, when query expansion and document quality estimation techniques are added, denoted as ""Hybrid-Fixed"", we empirically set , |R| to 0.5 and 30. However, when the query performance prediction technique is used, denoted as ""Hybrid-Reg"",  is not fixed. But it is obtained from a regression model that is trained as in [3].

It is of note that the results in our paper are obtained in a uniform setting across all collections while the best TREC results were from different participants independently. We believe the significant improvement is mainly from our successful integration of different IR techniques in the proposed model. In addition, according to Armstrong et al.'s survey, very few published results are better than the best TREC systems, mostly below medium systems. Our proposed model is promising, which provides a good avenue for future IR research, especially for evaluating the overall performance of a system (not a particular component of a system).",1,TREC,True

"Research in information retrieval evaluation has examined how to construct minimal test collections [2], and the balance between the number of queries judged and the depth of judging [3]. With respect to training rankers, most work has focused on document selection [1] or balancing number of queries with depth of documents judged using random query selection [5]. In this paper, we focus on selecting queries in order to most rapidly increase ranker retrieval performance.",0,,False
"In particular, we focus on the application of expected loss optimization (ELO) to query selection. Long et al. [4] used ELO to select queries for training but relied on having a ranker that estimated absolute graded relevance. We generalize this to work with any ranker ­ many of which induce a ranking but not absolute labels. To generalize to any ranker, we introduce a calibration phase over validation data.",1,ad,True
"In addition, although in theory ELO can be used with any performance measure for active learning, we show using DCG loss (as done in [4]) leads to better performance whether DCG or NDCG is used as the final evaluation of ranker performance. We provide evidence this is because ELO using DCG loss tends toward queries that have both more relevant examples and many degrees of relevance.",1,ad,True

We perform 20 iterations of labeling and based on the findings reported in [5] we label 15 documents per query (or the maximum available).

Note that regardless of whether evaluating by DCG or NDCG, using NDCG for selection (ndcgELOq) leads to the worst performance. In contrast, using DCG for selection leads to the best performance across both rankers and both evaluation measures. Finally, we note that the differences between methods are less significant when evaluated by NDCG than DCG. This suggests that while the learners are more effective ­ finding more relevant results per query ­ they are contributing to the marginal relevance for each query according to NDCG. The perceived impact on user utility will likely depend on the scenario and the degree to which the task is recall-oriented.",1,ad,True

"centage for the 15,000 labeled instances for SVMRank (the distribution trends for AR were nearly identical). Note that ndcgELOq selects far more irrelevant items than the other methods. This may seem surprising since NDCG selection is the same as DCG but normalized by the max estimate on the left-hand side of Eq. 1. However, for a poorly performing query with a single relevant document, NDCG's max will be 1 but current performance will be near zero. Thus, the selection method often selects queries with very few relevant documents. In contrast, dcgELOq not only obtains the largest percent of documents at the relevant side (labels 3,4) and fewest on the irrelevant side (label 0), it selects queries where a variety of relevance grades exist. This is consistent with the literature that biasing toward relevant documents is not sufficient in itself [1] ­ one also needs a variety of relevance grades present.",1,ad,True
5. SUMMARY,0,,False
"We presented a method that generalizes the applicability of ELO for query selection to any ranker. Our method also has the benefit of being less of a computational burden than training ensembles at each step prior to labeling. We also demonstrated that whether one cares about DCG or NDCG for performance, using DCG provides a more stable query selection method. This is because the nature of NDCG as a ratio pushes the selection toward queries that often have few relevant documents. In contrast, using DCG in the selection mechanism promotes queries that have more relevant documents, and the expected loss component ensures that there will be a variety of relevance grades ­ since current performance is far below the max. These insights may be useful in developing new query selection methods.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Many query performance predictors were proposed over the years [2]. Clarity [5] is a well known, commonly used, state-of-the-art predictor that measures the ""coherence"" of the top-retrieved documents with respect to the collection. Specifically, the more distinguishable the language used in the retrieved documents from the general language used in the collection, the better the retrieval is assumed to be1. Clarity was shown to be highly effective for most TREC benchmarks [6]. However, low prediction quality is observed when using Clarity for large scale, noisy, Web corpora [1].",1,TREC,True
"We present a novel formal analysis of Clarity that sheds some light on its underlying components and the properties of the result list of top-retrieved documents that it quantifies. While Clarity is commonly described as a measure of the ""distance"" between a language model induced from the result list and that induced from the collection, we show that Clarity actually quantifies an additional property of the result list, namely, its diversity. Our empirical analysis shows that the diversity of the result list has a negative correlation with retrieval performance for older TREC benchmarks and a positive correlation for the new ClueWeb collection. These findings, along with the formal analysis, help to explain the poor prediction quality of Clarity over ClueWeb.",1,ad,True

Following the common practice to evaluating prediction quality [2], we report Pearson's correlation between the values assigned by the predictor and retrieval effectiveness measured by average precision computed using TREC's relevance judgments. The size of the result list, k, was set to 500 following previous recommendations [6]. The relevance models were clipped to use only the 100 highest",1,TREC,True
"We showed that Clarity amounts to an equal weight interpolation of two predictors; one measures the ""distance"" of the result list from the collection, while the second measures the list's ""diversity"". We used this formal finding to help explain the low prediction quality of Clarity over ClueWeb, in contrast to its high effectiveness over other TREC benchmarks. Preliminary results of using non-equal weights for the interpolation mentioned above, and independently optimizing free-parameter values for each predictor, attest to the merits of these future directions.

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Real life information retrieval takes place in sessions, where users search by iterating between various cognitive, perceptual and motor subtasks through an interactive interface. The sessions may follow diverse strategies, which, together with the interface characteristics, affect user effort (cost), experience and session effectiveness. In this paper we propose a pragmatic evaluation approach based on scenarios with explicit subtask costs. We study the limits of effectiveness of diverse interactive searching strategies in two searching environments (the scenarios) under overall cost constraints. This is based on a comprehensive simulation of 20 million sessions in each scenario. We analyze the effectiveness of the session strategies over time, and the properties of the most and the least effective sessions in each case. Furthermore, we will also contrast the proposed evaluation approach with the traditional one, rank based evaluation, and show how the latter may hide essential factors that affect users' performance and satisfaction - and gives even counter-intuitive results.",1,ad,True

"During interaction the user selects between subtasks, e.g., whether to scan the result or launch a new query instead, and how to construct the query. Such selections obviously affect session gains. However, different subtasks also have costs, e.g., they take time. This is important because real life IR often takes place under (time)",1,ad,True

"The costs of subtasks may vary for many reasons between searching environments. For example, regarding the query side, small devices and touch screens are inconvenient for typing [11]. Recently, novel kinds of searching devices, including personal phone-based mobile devices, have become increasingly popular.",0,,False
"In order to minimize the overall session costs, a mobile phone user might e.g., avoid typing and prefer result scanning. Low input costs might change the situation from the user's point of view, leading to longer queries. Therefore, if we assume two users having identical needs and identical cost constraints regarding the overall session time, it is possible that different devices render different subtask combinations optimal in searching.",1,ad,True
"Traditional IR evaluation focuses on the quality of the ranked output. In this view, the costs of posing queries are non-problematic, even uninteresting. In this paper we will utilize simple scenarios to bring time factors into the research setting. Scenarios formalize and quantify the gains and costs of interactive sessions. We construct two cases ­ a personal desktop computer (PC) and a smart phone (SP) case, with subtask costs derived from the literature. We will simulate session interaction involving multiple queries based on prototypical but empirically grounded query modification strategies using a test collection. We then explore the effectiveness of searching via the exhaustive set of querying-scanning combinations possible, and evaluate the effectiveness of both scenarios in terms of Cumulated Gain (CG) [16] under time constraint (overall session time). We use non-normalized metrics, because normalized metrics may yield misleading results, especially if time is taken into account.",1,ad,True
"Early papers on IR evaluation had a comprehensive approach to interactive IR evaluation. Cleverdon et al. [8] pointed out, among others, physical and intellectual user effort as an important factor in IR evaluation. Salton [24] identified user effort measures in the context of IR evaluation. More recently Su [30] gave a comparison of 20 different evaluation measures for interactive IR, including actual cost of search, several utility measures, and worth of search results vs. time expended. The interactive aspect of IR requires attention because previous studies have repeatedly shown that discrepancy exists between interactive and non-interactive evaluation results. Hersh et al. [12] showed that a weighting scheme giving maximum improvement over the baseline in non-interactive batch evaluation failed to surpass others when real users performed a simulated task.

"Smucker [26] brought time factors into the traditional Cranfield setting by augmenting it with the use of the GOMS [7] model (acronym for Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selections). He suggests a user model for IR where the search process is seen as a sequence of actions (e.g., typing; clicking; evaluating a summary; waiting for the results to load) with associated times and probabilities (e.g., whether the simulated user will click on a relevant summary). He used the model in a simulated study to demonstrate the impact of changes in the IR system interface (e.g., when the speed and accuracy of the summary evaluation is varied) on user performance (the number of relevant documents read within a given time frame). While his experiment was limited to single query situations, the approach can be extended to multiple query scenarios, e.g., for computing the costs of specific query reformulations.",1,ad,True
Azzopardi [2] addressed the cost aspect by treating interactive IR as an economical problem and studied the trade-off between querying and browsing while maintaining a given level of normalized CG (NCG) [15] in sessions. His analysis focused on querying ­ scanning depth combinations for various formal retrieval methods that deliver a given level of NCG.,1,ad,True

The scanning lengths may fluctuate for many reasons. In this paper we study the properties of optimal and less optimal interactive behaviors in sessions below the given overall time constraint. Therefore we produced all possible sessions as follows. For all five QM strategies we formed all possible combinations of scanning lengths exhaustively (from 1 to 10 documents) using a sequence of all possible queries available per topic (cf. equation MCS in Section 2.1). We focus on the top documents because only few top documents may be inspected by the user in real life [14], [23], and only these may matter for the user [1]. As we had 5 words for each topic, sessions had at most 5 queries, controlled by the QM strategy and time constraint.

To study the significance of subtask costs under overall session cost constraint we define two scenarios, i.e., a Desktop PC scenario (PC) and a Smart phone scenario (SP). These scenarios have different subtask costs. This is justified because the properties of the devices partially determine the subtask costs [17].",1,ad,True

All queries in strategies S1, S2 and S3 have a fixed query length in sessions (one, two or three words, correspondingly) while in strategies S4 and S5 the queries grow longer. In real life the typing speed is affected by, e.g., the experience and knowledge of the person, the size of the keyboard, the layout of the keyboard (e.g., nine-key multi-tap vs. qwerty keyboard) [17], [18], and whether predictive text feed is available and used. We used literature to derive the cost values in scenarios PC and SP regarding the initial query cost and the subsequent query cost (Table 1).The query costs in S1 ­ S5 in the Desktop PC case are based on the typing costs of 3.0 seconds per word. The corresponding Smart Phone costs are based on [17]. The authors performed a large-scale log analysis of cell phone usage and observed that an average smart phone query length was 2.56 words and the average query-entry time was 39.8 seconds (average typing cost of 15.5 seconds per word). We assume in our simulations that the cost of adding one word to a query (that is, S4 and S5) or replacing one word at the end of the previous query (that is, S1, S2, S3) is a constant, i.e., either 3.0 or 15.5 seconds depending on the scenario.",1,ad,True

In this study we assume that the document snippet scanning cost is constant in both scenarios and across the searching strategies S1 ­ S5 (see Table 1).

"We ran all 41 topics * 5 QM strategies * Q queries, Q  {3, 4, 5} depending on the strategy, and collected their results. Then we generated all 111K possible sessions from the query results, pruned the ones exceeding the time constraint in each scenario, and by using the recall base (qrels), evaluated the CG of the scanned snippets for each session. For example, for the session Q1->s11-> s12>s13->Q2->s21->s22->Q3->s31, the CG is calculated on the basis of the snippet sequence s11, s12, s13, s21, s22, s31. Altogether about 45 million sessions (41 topics * 5 QM strategies* 111,110 possible scanning sessions * 2 scenarios) were evaluated. As the collection has graded relevance assessments, CG was incremented by 3 points for the highly relevant documents, 2 points for the fairly relevant documents and 1 point for the marginal ones. Whenever a duplicate was retrieved by a subsequent query in a session, its gain was nullified. Finally, we ranked all sessions within a topic and a strategy by their CG scores.

"We had three empirical and one methodological research question. The three empirical ones were about effectiveness of different QM strategies under time constraints, characteristics of the best and the worst QM sessions, and the stability of the observed trends. The methodological one was about proper evaluation of sessions under time constraints. We will consider each of the questions below. Strategy effectiveness. Given a stringent time frame in the PC scenario, the user cannot use the entire vocabulary (all queries) and perform exhaustive scanning for all queries. Short queries (strategy S1) are clearly inferior regarding session effectiveness. It seems reasonable to invest on two to three word queries (S2, S3) because the evidence thereby added for ranking significantly improves the quality of the results. This can also be seen in strategies S4 and S5, when they have enough time to advance beyond the first query. When more time is allocated to searching, the weaker strategies catch up because there is more time for scanning the results and the weaker ranking effectiveness is not that critical.",1,ad,True
"In the SP scenario the rules of the game change a bit. In a stringent time frame there is no time for tedious query input, and one must compromise toward short scanning of weaker quality rankings. The more effective strategies cannot be applied at all due to high query input cost. Again, when more time is allocated, weaker strategies catch up. In the longest sessions of S2-S5, the gap between the best vs. worst sessions begins to close.",0,,False
"Session characteristics. In the PC scenario, under stringent time constraints, the best sessions involved less queries and longer scans than the worst sessions (Table 3). However, as the time allocation grows, the differences disappear. Between the best strategies in the PC case, both the number of queries and the average scan lengths increase as time allocation grows (Tables 3-5). Correspondingly, in the worst sessions, the number of queries does not change as time grows, but the scan lengths grow. This is because the worst sessions consume all possible queries even under the shortest time frame. Similarity with best sessions grows.",1,Session,True
"In the SP scenario, under stringent time constraints, the best sessions also involved less queries and longer scans than the worst sessions (Table 3). As the time allocation grows, the differences remain, probably due to shortage of time even in the longer sessions. Between the best strategies in the SP case, both the number of queries and the average scan lengths increase as time allocation grows, the latter dramatically between 60 and 90 seconds (Tables 34). Correspondingly, in the worst sessions, the number of queries grows along time, but the scan lengths remain low. The worst behavior here means investing the effort in query input. Also here there were interesting differences in scan lengths between queries in sessions.",0,,False
"All in all, if time allows, two to three first query words that one identifies, followed by a longer scan, seem to provide reasonable performance, no matter what the strategy among S2-S5 is.",0,,False
"Effect of time. With limited time allowance, it seems important to make a good compromise between providing evidence for ranking (longer queries) and scanning the search results. The compromise depends on the overall cost levels related to the stringency of the time frame and on the relations between cost types. This depends on the searching device. Expensive input favors scanning at length, cheap input favors better queries. The more time is available the less it matters how one searches ­ there will be time to identify the relevant documents.",0,,False
"Evaluation methodology. Typical IR evaluation metrics are based on the quality of ranking alone. In session-based evaluation they must be applied with great care because they may be insufficient or even misleading. They may be partially insensitive to the user's experience and observed costs and benefits. This is particularly critical, when user's costs (time expenditure) are taken into account and the metric employs normalization, i.e. scaling the measurements to a predefined range such as [0, 1]. For example, the popular NDCG metric [15] and its non-discounted counterpart NCG should be avoided in any comparisons between searching environments, and between strategies within a given searching environment when input costs are taken into account. This is because the ideal gain vector used for normalization is read to vastly different lengths between strategies or environments.

However, when time is taken into account (Fig. 10), the scenarios and strategies differ greatly from each other. Up to 60 seconds, S3 in the SP case is the worst strategy and this is entirely due to the high input cost of the long query. With enough time (180 sec.), S3 in SP catches up S3 in PC case. Also, PC and SP do not much differ for S1 due to the relatively low input cost and weak result quality.

In addition, this could be taken into account by revising subsequent query costs (Table 1). We have chosen to short-cut here in order to avoid too much complexity at this stage. Furthermore, we do not consider the time users spend in examining documents. This may depend on the device used. This can be seen as an artificial limitation.

"In this study, we have shown the necessity of a pragmatic evaluation approach based on scenarios with explicit subtask costs under an overall time constraint. Effectiveness of various query modification and scanning strategies for two scenarios, namely, PC and SP is analyzed. Furthermore, the characteristics of the best and the worst interactive search sessions are examined. Expensive input favors scanning at length, cheap input favors better queries. The more time is available the less it matters how one searches ­ there will be time to identify the relevant documents. We have shown that the effort required by searching devices and the overall search time allocation drive interaction and profoundly affect both user experience and effectiveness in sessions in different scenarios. Moreover, we have also pointed out the inapt use of all normalized rank-based measures. Thus, we hope we could instigate new evaluation metrics for time-based comparisons.",0,,False

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"A dynamic pruning strategy, such as Wand, enhances retrieval efficiency without degrading effectiveness to a given rank K, known as safe-to-rank-K. However, it is also possible for Wand to obtain more efficient but unsafe retrieval without actually significantly degrading effectiveness. On the other hand, in a modern search engine setting, dynamic pruning strategies can be used to efficiently obtain the set of documents to be re-ranked by the application of a learned model in a learning to rank setting. No work has examined the impact of safeness on the effectiveness of the learned model. In this work, we investigate the impact of Wand safeness through experiments using 150 TREC Web track topics. We find that unsafe Wand is biased towards documents with lower docids, thereby impacting effectiveness.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"A search engine deploying learning to rank techniques reranks the top K documents retrieved by a standard weighting model, known as the sample [3], as shown in Figure 1. To improve the efficiency of such a deployment, a dynamic pruning strategy such as Wand [1] could easily be used, which omits the scoring of documents that cannot reach the top K retrieved set. In doing so, Wand is safe-to-rank-K, which we denote as safe for short.",0,,False
"Wand follows a Document-at-a-time retrieval strategy (DAAT), whereby the posting lists for all constituent terms of a query are processed in parallel, allowing immediate decisions as to whether a document has scored high enough to make the current top K retrieved set. In particular, Wand repeatedly calculates a pivot term, by comparing the upper bounds (t) of each query term t to the current score of the K-th ranked document, known as the threshold  . The next document containing the pivot term is called the pivot document, which will be the next document to be fully scored. If the scored document exceeds the threshold  , then the current K-th ranked document is expelled from the retrieved set, the new document inserted, and  updated. As the scoring for a query continues, the threshold  rises, such that more documents can be omitted from scoring.",0,,False

This paper provides a first study into the effect of safeness within a learning to rank setting, while providing explanations for the observed inherent bias in unsafe pruning that can improve effectiveness in some settings. Indeed, in contrast to a safe setting, unsafe Wand is dependent on the ordering of the collection, suggesting that further research into addressing the bias is needed.""",1,ad,True

"Figure 2 shows the NDCG@20 effectiveness of both the Wand sample, and LambdaMART applied on the sample document rankings from Wand, as F is varied. Note that as the learned model obtained by LambdaMART may be sensitive to a given F setting, a different model is learned for each F value. From Figure 2, we observe that the effectiveness to rank 20 of the Wand sample is unchanged for 1  F  3, mirroring the original observations of Broder et al. [1]. However, the LambdaMART performance is much less stable for different F values - indeed, the overall NDCG@20 trend is downward for larger F . This is explained in that the learned model ranks documents from deep in the sample, and hence is affected by degradations in the number of relevant documents retrieved in unsafe samples. Indeed, on analysing F ,"" 1, we find that of the top 20 documents ranked by LambdaMART, some were found as deep as rank 935 in the input sample ranking, while the mean rank in the sample of LambdaMART's top 20 documents was 89.""",1,ad,True
"However, for some small F values in Figure 2 (1 < F < 2), a learned model obtained from an unsafe sample could improve over the NDCG@20 of the learned model obtained from the safe F ,"" 1 sample. To analyse this unexpected characteristic, in Table 1 we compare and contrast four settings: F "", 1 and F ,"" 1.75, with and without the application of LambdaMART. Indeed, F "","" 1.75 is an interesting setting as while it is unsafe, it does not degrade NDCG@20 of the sample ranking obtained from Wand, but significantly improves the effectiveness of LambdaMART, according to a paired t-test (p < 0.01). Moreover, F "", 1.75 is an efficient setting (we find that it reduces the mean response time of 1000 queries from a query log by 19% compared to F ,"" 1, while larger F values do not cause further time reductions).""",1,ad,True
"Next, comparing the sample rankings obtained from Wand for F , 1 and F ,"" 1.75, we note a decrease of 82 relevant documents retrieved across the 50 test queries. Moreover, we examined the docids (in the range 0..50M for ClueWeb09 cat. B) of the documents selected in the safe and unsafe samples. We found that, on average, the safe sample retrieved documents from later in the posting lists (i.e. higher docids) than the unsafe sample (mean docids: 24.3M vs 21.9M). This observation is mirrored in the documents retrieved in one sample and not the other: the mean docid of documents""",1,ClueWeb,True
"Figure 3: Distribution of relevant documents across the docid range, and for the safe & unsafe samples.",0,,False
"in the safe sample that are missing from the unsafe sample is 35M, while unsafe sample documents missing from safe have a mean docid of 11.2M. Finally, Figure 3 presents the distribution of relevant docids, as well as those retrieved in the safe and unsafe samples. This shows that while there is no docid bias for relevant documents, unsafe Wand is more biased towards low docids than safe Wand. Indeed, the mean docid of the relevant documents retrieved in the safe sample is higher than those found in the unsafe sample (26.7M vs 25.6M in Table 1), explaining the change in retrieval effectiveness. Overall, this shows that aggressive, unsafe pruning by Wand can change the selected documents in a biased manner that is not present in safe pruning.",0,,False
"This behaviour of Wand is explained as follows: by artificially increasing the threshold  by the factor F , the threshold for unsafe Wand causes more documents to be prevented from entering the top K. Early in the traversal of the posting lists, when the  is lower, documents can still enter into the retrieved set. However as  gets higher, more pruning occurs, even for documents that would have made the retrieved set for F , 1. This explains unsafe Wand's comparative preference for lower docid documents.",1,ad,True
4. CONCLUSIONS,0,,False
"We contrasted the effectiveness of safe vs. unsafe rankings from Wand, and its impact on the effectiveness of a learning to rank technique, using ClueWeb09 cat. B and 150 TREC Web track topics. We found that while unsafe retrieval effectiveness has little impact on the top ranked documents directly retrieved by Wand, it does impact deeper down, which can be to the detriment of a learned model applied on that sample. Some unsafe settings were even found to benefit the learned model. Through further analysis, we found that unsafe retrieval has an inherent bias towards documents with lower docids in the applied index ordering.",1,ClueWeb,True
"The observations in this paper can give rise to several further research lines. In particular, static collection orderings may be devised that counteract unsafe Wand's preference for lower docids. On the other hand, it may be possible to devise different manners of changing the threshold for increasing Wand's efficiency in a less biased manner.",0,,False

"Assessors frequently disagree on the relevance of a document to a topic. Voorhees [2000] finds that TREC adhoc assessors have mutual F1 scores of around 0.6, while Roitblat et al. [2010] report mutual F1 as low as 0.35 for professional e-discovery reviewers. Such low agreement is of serious practical concern in e-discovery, where large-scale, delegated manual review is still widely used. Possible causes of disagreement include assessor error and ambiguity in instructions. We examine whether detailed relevance guidelines increase agreement amongst assessors and with the guideline author, and find no significant increase in either form of agreement",1,TREC,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"In medical records, negative qualifiers, e.g. no or without, are commonly used by health practitioners to identify the absence of a medical condition. Without considering whether the term occurs in a negative or positive context, the sole presence of a query term in a medical record is insufficient to imply that the record is relevant to the query. In this paper, we show how to effectively handle such negation within a medical records information retrieval system. In particular, we propose a term representation that tackles negated language in medical records, which is further extended by considering the dependence of negated query terms. We evaluate our negation handling technique within the search task provided by the TREC Medical Records 2011 track. Our results, which show a significant improvement upon a system that does not consider negated context within records, attest the importance of handling negation.",1,TREC,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Search in the medical domain is notable for its extensive use of negated language within medical records [2]. However, recently Koopman et al. [2] asserted that the use of term frequency in document weighting models such as BM25 automatically alleviates the problems of negated language. Notably, they argue that terms in negative contexts typically appear once per medical record while, in contrast, terms indicating the presence of a medical condition (positive terms) appear frequently. In this paper, we argue that a dedicated negation handling approach will outperform traditional retrieval models for medical domain queries. Additionally, prior works have focused almost exclusively on negated language in queries rather than documents (e.g. boolean retrieval models or vector negation [7]). For example, for the query `NOT chest pain AND shortness of breath', the boolean model will find documents not containing `chest pain', thereby not considering any negation occurring within the records. Moreover, most words indicating negation (e.g. no, not) are stopwords, which are not typically indexed [1].",1,ad,True
"To cope with negation in medical search, we propose a two-step process: a term representation approach, NegFlag, to facilitate the handling of negative context in medical records; and a novel term dependence approach to demote",0,,False

As our results exhibit significant improvement over a baseline where negation is not handled, we conclude that negated language should be explicitly handled for effective medial records search.",1,TREC,True
2. THE NEGFLAG APPROACH,1,AP,True
"Our negated term representation approach, NegFlag, modifies the indexing process to distinguish between positive and negative context terms in medical records, which are identified using the NegEx algorithm [1]. Identified negated terms are replaced with special negated versions of those terms. Table 1 shows how an example sentence is processed using NegFlag, such that the term `fever' is replaced with its negated version, `n0fever'.",0,,False
"Hence, given the query `find patient with fever', without NegFlag, a retrieval model might erroneously rank the original record in Table 1 highly, because it contains all of the query terms. However, after NegFlag processing, as `fever' has become `n0fever', the record would not score as highly.",0,,False
"However, while NegFlag only helps to retrieve records containing query terms with positive contexts, it does not prevent records with the negated occurrences from being retrieved. For example, the NegFlag processed example in Table 1 might still be retrieved for the query `find patient with fever and palpitations', when the patient is known not to have a fever. To alleviate this, in the next section, we propose the use of term dependence to demote medical records containing query terms within negative contexts.",0,,False
3. TERM DEPENDENCE FOR NEGATION,0,,False
"Term dependence (e.g. Markov Random Fields [4]) has been used to improve effectiveness by scoring higher documents containing many occurrences of pairs of query terms in close proximity. In contrast, we propose to use term dependence to demote records containing the negated form of neighbouring terms occurring in the queries. For example, given a query `chest pain', documents containing the pair of terms `n0chest n0pain' should be demoted. To this effect, we score medical record r for a query Q, taking negation into account, as follows:",0,,False

"We evaluate our negated term representation and the term dependence approaches using the 34 topics from the TREC 2011 Medical Records track [6]. In this track, the task is to identify relevant patient visits for each topic, where a visit contains all of the medical records associated with that patients' admission to the hospital. For indexing and retrieval, we use Terrier1, applying Porter's English stemmer and removing stopwords. The parameter-free DFR DPH term weighting model is used to rank medical records. The expCombSUM voting technique [3] is then used to rank visits based on the scores of their associated medical records. The number of voting medical records is limited to 5,000 as this was found to be effective in preliminary experiments. We hypothesise that negation should be explicitly handled, hence we compare our approach with a baseline where negation is not explicitly handled, as suggested in [2].",1,TREC,True
"Figure 1 shows the bpref retrieval performance comparing NegFlag, as well as the SD and FD variants of term dependence with NegFlag, and the baseline where negation is not handled. From Figure 1, we observe that our approach employing either only NegFlag or both NegFlag and term dependence outperforms the baseline (bpref 0.4871), by up to 4%. Indeed, NegFlag alone markedly improves the retrieval performance over the baseline, while term dependence for window size ,"" 3 using either SD or FD results in statistically significant improvements over the baseline (paired t-test, p < 0.05).""",0,,False
"For SD, small window sizes are more effective, but performance is generally stable across different window sizes, suggesting that the presence of negated ordered pairs anywhere in a medical record is sufficient to ascertain if it should be demoted. For FD, window size > 3 degrades performance compared to NegFlag, but still outperforms the baseline.",1,ad,True
"Next, we further evaluate the effectiveness of our approach after applying a query expansion (QE) technique (namely DFR Bo1 from Terrier).

Overall, our results are very promising, particularly if term dependence and query expansion can be successfully combined in future work.",1,ad,True

"We have proposed a novel approach to handle negation in medical search using our NegFlag term representation and a novel use of term dependence to demote documents containing the query terms in a negative context. Our approach is shown to be effective on the Medical Records track test collection, across a range of window sizes. Moreover, it verifies our stance that negation should be explicitly handled in medical search. Our proposed approach could also work with queries that contain negative contexts; however, as the available topics in the TREC 2011 test collection do not contain any negated terms, we leave this evaluation for future work.",1,TREC,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"TextRank is a variant of PageRank typically used in graphs that represent documents, and where vertices denote terms and edges denote relations between terms. Quite often the relation between terms is simple term co-occurrence within a fixed window of k terms. The output of TextRank when applied iteratively is a score for each vertex, i.e. a term weight, that can be used for information retrieval (IR) just like conventional term frequency based term weights.",0,,False
"So far, when computing TextRank term weights over cooccurrence graphs, the window of term co-occurrence is always fixed. This work departs from this, and considers dynamically adjusted windows of term co-occurrence that follow the document structure on a sentence- and paragraphlevel. The resulting TextRank term weights are used in a ranking function that re-ranks 1000 initially returned search results in order to improve the precision of the ranking. Experiments with two IR collections show that adjusting the vicinity of term co-occurrence when computing TextRank term weights can lead to gains in early precision.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Associative networks have long been used to represent units of text and their interconnecting relations [5]. The symbolic structures that emerge from these representations correspond to graphs, where text constituents are represented as vertices and their interconnecting relations as edges. Graph ranking algorithms, such as the TextRank [5, 6] variant of PageRank, have been used successfully in keyword extraction [6], classification [3] and information retrieval [2] to compute term weights from graphs of individual documents, where vertices represent the document's terms, and edges represent term co-occurrence within a fixed window. Using these computations iteratively, the weight of a term can be estimated with respect to the terms that fall in its vicinity and their respective term weights. An underlying",0,,False

"assumption in these approaches is that the vicinity of term co-occurrence is fixed for all terms. To our knowledge, there is no theoretical or intuitive basis for this assumption.",0,,False
"Fixed-window term co-occurrence may not be optimal for TextRank term weights. Lexical affinities may span across more words in longer sentences than they do in shorter sentences. Hence, adjusting the co-occurrence window according to the discourse span of the text might be a better choice. Based on this intuition, in this work we look at the effect of dynamically adjusted windows of term co-occurrence upon their resultant TextRank term weights. We experiment with co-occurrence windows that follow the document structure on two levels of granularity: sentences and paragraphs. For each of these, we compute term weights using TextRank, and use them for retrieval using the ranking model of [2], i.e. linearly combined with inverse document frequency (idf). Experiments using these TextRank term weights for re-ranking the top 1000 search results show that sentence-based cooccurrence can outperform fixed-window co-occurrence in terms of early precision.",1,ad,True

"Table 2 shows different metrics of retrieval performance when using fixed versus sentence- and paragraph-length windows of term co-occurrence. We see that results vary3. For average precision (NDCG) fixed co-occurrence is best for RCV1, and sentence-based co-occurrence is best for INEX. The reverse happens for precision in the top 10 retrieved documents (P@10): fixed co-occurrence is best for INEX, and sentence-based co-occurrence is best for RCV1. The only consistent trend is in the precision of the single top retrieved document (MRR), which benefits more from dynamically adjusted co-occurrence consistently for both collections. This finding is novel, considering the earlier position of [6] that the larger the window of co-occurrence, the lower the precision. This finding indicates that larger window sizes may lead to gains in precision, if however they are not fixed but rather dynamically adjusted to text units like sentences.",1,RCV1,True
"Finally, sentences appear to be an overall better boundary of term co-occurrence than paragraphs, with the exception of NDCG for INEX where paragraph-based co-occurrence slightly outperforms sentence-based co-occurrence (and they both outperform fixed co-occurrence).

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"We consider the impact of inter-assessor disagreement on the maximum performance that a ranker can hope to achieve. We demonstrate that even if a ranker were to achieve perfect performance with respect to a given assessor, when evaluated with respect to a different assessor, the measured performance of the ranker decreases significantly. This decrease in performance may largely account for observed limits on the performance of learning-to-rank algorithms.",0,,False

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"In both Machine Learning and Information Retrieval, it is well known that limitations in the performance of ranking algorithms can result from several sources, such as insufficient training data, inherent limitations of the learning/ranking algorithm, poor instance features, and label errors. In this paper we focus on performance limitations due solely to label ""errors"" which arise due to inter-assessor disagreement.",0,,False
"Consider a training assessor A that provides labels for training data and a testing assessor B that provides labels for testing data. Even if a ranker can produce a perfect list as judged by A, its performance will be suboptimal with respect to B, given inevitable inter-assessor disagreement. In effect, no ranking algorithm can simultaneously satisfy two or more disagreeing assessors (or users). Thus, there are inherent limitations in the performance of ranking algorithms, independent of the quality of the learning/ranking algorithm, the availability of sufficient training data, the quality of extracted instance features, and so on.",0,,False
"We model inter-assessor disagreement with a confusion matrix C, where cij corresponds to the (conditional) probability that a document labeled i by testing assessor B will be labeled j by training assessor A, for some given set of label grades such as {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. Given such a model of interassessor disagreement, we ask the question, ""What is the",1,ad,True

"expected performance of a ranked list optimized for training assessor A but evaluated with respect to testing assessor B?"" We approach this question in two ways, via simulation and closed form approximation. In the former case, we use the confusion matrix C to probabilistically generate training labels A from testing labels B, optimally rank documents according to A, and evaluate with respect to B. In the latter case, we analytically derive a closed-form approximation to this limiting performance, as measured by nDCG.",0,,False
"Given a confusion matrix C modeling inter-assessor disagreement, one can apply our results to any learning-to-rank dataset. The limiting nDCG values obtained correspond to reasonable upper bounds on the nDCG performance of any learning-to-rank algorithm, even one given unlimited training data and perfect features. Considering the performance of existing algorithms on these datasets, and comparing with the upper bounds we derive, one can argue that learning-torank is approaching reasonable limits on achievable performance.",0,,False

"Much research in the IR community has focused on addressing the problem of system evaluation in the context of missing, incomplete, or incorrect document judgments [1]. Soboroff and Carterette [4] provide an in-depth analysis of the effect of assessor disagreement on the Million Query Track evaluation techniques. Both assessors and users often disagree on the degree of document relevance to a given query, and we model such disagreement with a confusion matrix C as described above. On data sets with multiple assessments per query-document pair, such as the TREC Enterprise Track [2], these confusion matrices can be directly estimated from data, and they can be obtained from user studies as well [3, 5].",1,ad,True
"For any ranked list returned by a system, the expected limiting nDCG due to assessor disagreement can be formulated as a function of (1) the disagreement model C and (2) the number of assessed documents and their distribution over the label classes. One way to compute this expected nDCG is numerical simulation: For every document d having testing label id in the ranked list, we randomly draw an alternative label jd with the probability cij; we then sort the ranked list in decreasing order of {jd} and evaluate its nDCG performance with respect to labels {id}. This simulation is repeated multiple times and the results averaged to obtain an accurate estimate of the expected limiting nDCG.",0,,False

For comparison, the last column in the table presents the actual best known performance of a learning algorithm on these data sets. Consider the difference between the estimated limiting nDCG bounds (middle three columns) and known ranking performance (last column): If CMSR is a good model of assessor disagreement for these data sets, then the known learning-to-rank performance is reasonably close to the limiting bound, and little improvement is possible.

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Most of the relevance feedback algorithms only use document terms as feedback (local features) in order to update the query and re-rank the documents to show to the user. This approach is limited by the terms of those documents without any global context. We propose to use statistical topic modeling techniques in relevance feedback to incorporate a better estimate of context by including global information about the document. This is particularly helpful for difficult queries where learning the context from the interactions with the user is crucial. We propose to use the topic mixture information obtained to characterize the documents and learn their topics. Then, we rank documents incorporating positive and negative feedback by fitting a latent distribution for each class of documents online and combining all the features using Bayesian Logistic Regression. We show results using the OHSUMED dataset for 3 different variants and obtain higher performance, up to 12.5% in Mean Average Precision (MAP).",1,corpora,True

"Relevance feedback has been studied extensively in Information Retrieval as a form of incorporating feedback from the user to refine the results retrieved. The authors in [5] concluded that negative feedback is also valuable to improve the ranking. However, the need to capture broader context in difficult queries is still a challenge. The authors in [2] have showed that including global features and using clusters can improve the retrieval performance significantly. Thus, statistical topic modeling provides a robust and automatic method to incorporate context to the user feedback.",1,corpora,True

"Previous approaches have used statistical topic models to represent documents according to their latent topic content and use this representation in information retrieval [1, 4]. Authors in [4], use topics as a form of smoothing the Language Model used in retrieval. However, this approach does not address the incorporation of relevance feedback. Recent work from [1] explores the use of topics as a form to perform the query expansion for relevance feedback. However, this action might make the query noisier because the top topic terms might not contribute to a better discrimination of the relevant documents. In addition, these terms might not be distinctive across different topics.",1,ad,True
"We propose to include the topic information as feedback using the document topic mixture instead of the document word mixture. We first estimate the topic mixture for each document in the corpus using LDA and save it as meta data. Given an initial query we use a standard retrieval engine, Language Models for this case, to show the first set of documents to the user and obtain relevance judgments. Then, we assume that topic mixtures for feedback documents are observed. We then define two latent Dirichlet distributions: one for relevant documents and another for nonrelevant documents. We fit these distributions iteratively, by finding a sufficient statistic and maximizing the likelihood of observing this statistic. To score the documents, we use Bayesian Logistic Regression. This function results in a very efficient scoring function, and incorporates the benefits of active learning. Under this model, we incorporate positive and negative feedback, and context based on topics in the interaction without changing the query. We also provide efficient updates of the latent distributions based on topics.",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"In crowdsourced relevance judging, each crowd worker typically judges only a small number of examples, yielding a sparse and imbalanced set of judgments in which relatively few workers influence output consensus labels, particularly with simple consensus methods like majority voting. We show how probabilistic matrix factorization, a standard approach in collaborative filtering, can be used to infer missing worker judgments such that all workers influence output labels. Given complete worker judgments inferred by PMF, we evaluate impact in unsupervised and supervised scenarios. In the supervised case, we consider both weighted voting and worker selection strategies based on worker accuracy. Experiments on crowd judgments from the 2010 TREC Relevance Feedback Track show promise of the PMF approach merits further investigation and analysis.",1,TREC,True

"Crowdsourced relevance judging offers potential to reduce time, cost, and effort of relevance judging [1] and benefit from greater diversity of crowd judges. However, quality of judgments from non-workers continues to be a concern, motivating continuing work in quality assurance methods based on statistical label aggregation methods or greater attention to human factors. A common approach is to collect multiple, redundant judgments from workers and aggregate them via methods like majority voting (MV) or expectation maximization (EM) to produce consensus labels [4].",0,,False
"Because each crowd worker typically judges only a small number of examples, collected judgments are typically sparse and imbalanced, with relatively few workers influencing output consensus labels. MV is completely susceptible to this problem. EM addresses this indirectly: while only workers",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) today is dominated by techniques that use token-to-token mappings from bilingual dictionaries. Yet, state-of-the-art statistical translation models (e.g., using Synchronous Context-Free Grammars) are far richer, capturing multi-term phrases, term dependencies, and contextual constraints on translation choice. We present a novel CLIR framework that is able to reach inside the translation ""black box"" and exploit these sources of evidence. Experiments on the TREC-5/6 EnglishChinese test collection show this approach to be promising.",1,TREC,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Query translation approaches for cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) can be pursued either by applying a machine translation (MT) system or by using a token-to-token bilingual mapping. These approaches have complementary strengths: MT makes good use of context but at the cost of producing only one-best results, while token-to-token mappings can produce n-best token translations but without leveraging available contextual clues. This has led to a small cottage industry of what we might refer to as ""context recovery"" in which postprocessing techniques are used to select or reweight translation alternatives, usually based on evidence from term co-occurrence in a comparable collection.",1,Query,True
"We argue that this false choice results from thinking of MT systems as black boxes [5]. Inside an MT system we find not alternative translations for individual tokens, but rather for entire sentences. In state-of-the-art MT systems, these alternative ""readings"" are based on Synchronous Context-Free Grammars (SCFG) and pieced together from units of varying size with complex hierarchical dependencies. Reducing these to context independent token translation probabilities discards potentially useful contextual constraints. An elegant solution, which we explore in this work, is to perform translation in context using a full SCFG MT system and then to reconstruct context-sensitive n-best token translation probabilities by tokenizing each reading and accumulating translation likelihood evidence, which can then be renormalized as estimates of probabilities. This technique is now routinely used in speech retrieval [7], but we are not aware of its prior use for CLIR.",1,ad,True
These context-sensitive token translation probabilities can then be used in the same way as context-independent probabilities. We,0,,False

We use the Okapi BM25 term weighting function, although in principle any other weighting function can be substituted.",1,ad,True
"Compared against this baseline, we show how we can take advantage of a full MT decoder to better estimate translation probabilities. A decoder uses a translation model (TM) and language model (LM) to find all possible derivations of a source text, and the corresponding translations in the target language, along with associated derivation scores.

We evaluated our approach on the English-Chinese CLIR task of TREC-5/6: although we did not observe significant improvements, we feel that this approach is nevertheless promising. In future work we plan to try this approach for document translation (where we would expect greater benefit from context, although with higher computational cost, at least in experimental settings). Replications on test collections with larger numbers of topics, and with a greater variety of query and topic languages, can also be expected to yield additional insights.",1,ad,True

"The Twitter real-time information network is the subject of research for information retrieval tasks such as real-time search. However, so far, reproducible experimentation on Twitter data has been impeded by restrictions imposed by the Twitter terms of service. In this paper, we detail a new methodology for building and distributing Twitter corpora, developed through collaboration between the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) and Twitter. In particular, we detail how the first publicly available Twitter corpus ­ referred to as Tweets2011 ­ was distributed via lists of tweet identifiers and dedicated tweet crawling software. Furthermore, we analyse whether this distribution approach remains robust over time, as tweets in the corpus are removed by users. Tweets2011 was successfully used by 58 participating groups for the TREC 2011 Microblog track, and our results attest to the robustness of the crawling methodology over time.",1,Twitter,True

"Twitter is a communications platform on which users can send short, 140-character messages, called ""tweets"", to their ""followers"" (other users who subscribe to those messages). Conversely, users can receive tweets from people they follow via a number of mechanisms, including web clients, mobile clients, and SMS. As of Spring 2011, Twitter has over 140 million active users worldwide, who collectively post over 340 million tweets per day. Twitter is an active research area in the information retrieval (IR) field [1]. However, previously it has not been possible to build and distribute reusable tweet corpora due to restrictions placed upon researchers by Twitter's terms of service.1 Indeed, this has resulted in two prior unsuccessful attempts to share Twitter data by Stanford and Edinburgh universities.",1,Twitter,True

"that investigated tweet search and ranking [2]. In line with the TREC aims and in collaboration with Twitter, a new methodology was developed to build and distribute a publicly available Twitter dataset, known as Tweets2011. In this paper, we describe this new methodology, whereby a corpus like Tweets2011, is distributed as a set of tweet identifiers and a tweet crawling tool for downloading the identified tweets. However, since researchers separately download the tweets themselves at different times, and the set of tweets available is not static (as tweets can be deleted), the exact composition of the corpus will vary depending upon when it is downloaded. We also examine how robust the distribution methodology is over time, by comparing crawls of Tweets2011 made at different points in time. Our results show that over the time period tested, the changes in the corpus over time had no noticeable effect on the systems that participated in the TREC 2011 Microblog track.",1,TREC,True
2. DISTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY,0,,False
"The Twitter terms of service forbids third parties from data redistribution, which means that researchers that have gathered tweets cannot share them. To overcome these constraints, a compromise had to be reached. In particular, a collection would not consist of the tweets themselves, but rather (username, tweet id) pairs and associated software for reconstructing the tweets.",1,Twitter,True
"The Twitter REST API provides flexible access to any available tweet; nearly all common Twitter capabilities can be programmatically accessed, e.g., posting new tweets, retweeting, following a user, searching, etc. The API is generally available to the public, although by default it is rate limited; the most common unauthenticated connection places a limit of 150 requests per hour. This restriction makes it impractical to gather large number of tweets for offline processing. Historically, Twitter has lifted the API request limit for some clients based on a particular IP address or an authentication token, but this capability is no longer offered.",1,Twitter,True

For researchers that had access to the REST API without rate limit restrictions, that can be used to download each tweet in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. However, for researchers without this access, the fetcher instead crawls raw HTML pages from the twitter.com site and reconstructs the tweets in JSON format, as shown in Figure 1.",1,ad,True

"We used the above methodology to distribute the Tweets2011 collection to the participants of the TREC 2011 Microblog track, which is now available to everyone.2 To create Tweets2011, we identified a common set of tweets (username, tweet id pairs), for distribution. In particular, we created a sample from tweets posted during the period from January 23rd to February 8th, 2011 (inclusive). It was important to sample, as even for users who were not rate limited, downloading billions or more tweets in a sequential manner would not be practical. Instead, some spam removal was performed and then approximately 1% of the remaining tweets were sampled for the corpus, resulting in a set of approximately 16 million tweets. The distribution of these tweets over the two week period is shown in Figure 2. The chosen time period includes the Egyptian revolution as well as the US Superbowl, and a spike of tweeting activity on February 6th is easily observed. Moreover, to ensure the corpus was representative of the multi-lingual tweet retrieval environment, no language filtering was performed.",1,Tweet,True
"For the evaluation of TREC 2011 participating systems, 49 topics were created. From the pool of 50,324 tweets formed from the participants runs for these topics, 2,965 were judged relevant.",1,TREC,True
4. COLLECTION DEGRADATION,0,,False
"Tweets2011 is unique in the history of information retrieval test collections in that it will degrade over time. Twitter users can delete their tweets, or mark their accounts as private, and after that point, these tweets will not be part of the collection. This is an experimental challenge because system effectiveness may be affected by missing tweets even if those tweets are not relevant, for example due to altered collection statistics. If two systems are compared on different versions of the collection, we worry that those comparisons may not be valid.",1,Tweet,True
"Figure 3 illustrates the effect as we have been able to observe it in the short lifetime of the collection so far. When someone downloads the collection in HTML format, which was the case for nearly all participants, each tweet has an HTTP status code associated with it. HTTP 404 indicates a deleted tweet, 403 indicates a protected tweet, and 302 indicates a retweet. Status 301 represents a new report code from the Twitter API and we are not entirely certain what",1,ad,True

For the 4th of November 2011 crawl, 3,424,155 (21.2%) of the original 16,141,809 tweets were unavailable. Note that for some status codes, the number of missing tweets is not monotonically increasing. This behavior can result from crawler (download) errors, as well as when users mark their accounts as private and subsequently open them again.",1,ad,True
"We measured the effect of this collection decay by recrawling the collection after all participants had done so, and removing 200 tweets that were pooled and judged for the 49 topics, but which were subsequently deleted or protected. We then computed the precision at rank 30 of all participating runs, and compared the ordering of runs by P@30 to the official results using Kendall's  . The correlation was 0.99, indicating that missing tweets seemed to affect all participating systems equally if at all.",1,ad,True
"Further decay in the collection may render it unusable at some point in the future. We do not recommend comparing evaluation scores done after TREC to the official TREC results, because of decay concerns. Rather, experimenters should compare multiple systems (or versions of the same system) that all use the same crawl, or closely contemporaneous crawls. This is not a concern for the official TREC results since participants all crawled the collection during a short window of time.",1,TREC,True
5. CONCLUSIONS,0,,False
"We detailed a new methodology for building and distributing tweet corpora, developed through collaboration between the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) and Twitter. In particular, we described how tweet corpora can distributed via lists of tweet identifiers in tandem with tweet crawling software. This distribution approach will work for any collection of tweets. We detailed the first corpus to be distributed in this manner, Tweets2011. We recognized that the corpus may change over time as tweets are deleted, and through an analysis of different versions of the Tweets2011 corpus downloaded by TREC participants, we showed that the distribution method, at least to date, is robust to changes in the underlying corpus.",1,corpora,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"In information retrieval, relevance judgments play an important role as they are used for evaluating the quality of retrieval systems. Numerous papers have been published using judgments obtained from a commercial search engine by researchers in industry. As typically no information is provided about the quality of these judgments, their reliability for evaluating retrieval systems remains questionable. In this paper, we analyze the reliability of such judgments for evaluating the quality of retrieval systems by comparing them to judgments by NIST judges at TREC.",1,TREC,True

"In information retrieval (IR), test collections are typically used to evaluate and optimize the performance of IR systems. The quality of a test collection can impact the conclusions of the evaluation, where the quality of the relevance judgments is a key factor. For example, evaluation outcomes are shown to be affected by using different judge populations [1] and different judging guidelines [3]. On the other hand, using different judges from the same population of NIST judges employed by TREC has been shown to lead to relatively stable conclusions as to which retrieval algorithm beats another [4].",1,TREC,True
"In recent years, several papers using judgments obtained from a commercial search engine have been published [2]. Most of these papers use such judgments (which are typically not publicly available) to validate the superiority of their proposed methods over existing algorithms. Since judges employed by commercial search engine companies are likely to come from different populations than NIST judges and are likely to be subjected to different training and judging",0,,False

This gave us a total of 1603 unique query-URL pairs for the 100 topics.",1,TREC,True
"We constructed three different collections by obtaining judgments from three judge groups : judges from (1) the TREC Web track ad-hoc task (NIST), (2) a commercial search engine (ProWeb), and (3) crowdsourcing (Crowd). ProWeb judges were experienced and highly trained judges, employed by the search engine company, while crowd workers, recruited via Clickworker, received no prior training on relevance assessing.",1,TREC,True
"The NIST judgments differ across the two years. In 2009, three relevance levels were used (Highly Relevant, Relevant, and Not Relevant), while in 2010, five grades of relevance were used (Navigational, Key, Relevant, Non-relevant, and Junk). The ProWeb and Crowd judgments were obtained using a simple interface that asked judges to rate a search result's usefulness to a query using a five point scale that can be viewed as a variation of the 2010 Web Track scale (Ideal, Highly Relevant, Relevant, Somewhat Relevant, Nonrelevant). Unlike the ProWeb and Crowd judges, the NIST judges were given descriptions (topic narrative) about what information need is associated with a particular query.",1,ad,True
"Using the different sets of judgments and the NDCG measure, we evaluate the effectiveness of the runs submitted to the TREC 2009 and 2010 Web Track ad-hoc task. Since we only have labels for a subset of the retrieved documents, we remove unjudged documents from the runs. To avoid variance due to having different documents labeled across the different judge groups, we only consider documents that were judged by all three groups.",1,TREC,True

However, if we compare the agreements between the evaluations using the Crowd and ProWeb judgments, we also see low agreements. This suggests that the low correlation is specific to this particular TREC. As the figure suggests, systems that were submitted to this particular TREC have very similar performance. Hence, the Kendall's  statistic may be affected by these systems. Furthermore, when we""",1,TREC,True

When we analyzed the disagreement cases, we realized that these differences could be caused by the specific topic description that was given to the NIST judges, which limited the possible intents associated with a query. Since the Crowd and ProWeb judges were not given such topic descriptions, they would have considered all possible intents for a query when assigning labels to the documents.",0,,False

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Lab-based evaluations typically assess the quality of a retrieval system with respect to its ability to retrieve documents that are relevant to the information need of an end user. In a real-time search task however users not only wish to retrieve the most relevant items but the most recent as well. The current evaluation framework is not adequate to assess the ability of a system to retrieve both recent and relevant items, and the one proposed in the recent TREC Microblog Track has certain flaws that quickly became apparent to the organizers. In this poster, we redefine the experiment for a real-time ad-hoc search task, by setting new submission requirements for the submitted systems/runs, proposing metrics to be used in evaluating the submissions, and suggesting a pooling strategy to be used to gather relevance judgments towards the computation of the described metrics. The proposed task can indeed assess the quality of a retrieval system with regard to retrieving both relevant and timely information.",1,ad,True

"Lab-based evaluations typically assess the quality of a retrieval system with respect to its ability to retrieve documents that are relevant to the information need of an end user. There are retrieval tasks however for which relevance is only one of the dimensions on which we want to evaluate retrieval systems. In particular, we consider a real-time ad-hoc retrieval task, where the user wishes to retrieve information that is not only relevant, but also recent ­ the",1,ad-hoc,True

"focus of the recent TREC Microblog Track [1]. The corpus for the task was composed of about 16 million tweets with time-stamps. Information needs were represented by queries at specific time-stamps. Systems were expected to respond to each query with the most recent relevant tweets, prior to the query time.",1,TREC,True
"Evaluating a system over a real-time ad-hoc task clearly requires a measure that accounts both for relevance and recency. Instead of inventing a new measure the TREC Microblog Track chose to use traditional set-based evaluation measures on a time-ordered ranked list of the submitted by participants ranked lists of tweets/runs. Each participant was asked to submit a set of up to 1000 tweets, submitted tweets were then ordered by reverse time, the top 30 were pooled, handed to NIST assessors to be assessed with respect to relevance (""interestingness""), and each system was then evaluated by precision@30 over these 30 time-ordered tweets.",1,ad-hoc,True
"What became immediately apparent was that such an experiment could not properly measure the effectiveness of a system to provide both timely and relevant tweets. A system could achieve optimal performance by returning just 30 relevant tweets, ignoring the time dimension. Hence, the optimal strategy for each run was to return a set of the top-30 tweets ordered by a probability (score) of relevance, even if these were not the most recent relevant tweets. An intuitive explanation of the flaw in this evaluation experiment is that runs were not evaluated against a single global target set of tweets (the most relevant, recent tweets) and thus the evaluation measure was only aware of the relevant and non-relevant tweets returned by each individual system separately. The aim of this poster is to correct this flaw by redefining a real-time ad-hoc task experiment, in a form suitable for the Microblog track, in which systems are evaluated for their ability to return both relevant and timely information.",1,ad-hoc,True

General description of the task: The aim for each system is to retrieve the 30 most recent relevant items.,0,,False
"Submission requirements: Participants will need to submit (a) a set of not more than 30 items; (b) a ranked list of 1000 top previous items by relevance only. Evaluation will be based on the set only (see Metrics below), but the ranked list will be used in constructing the assessment pools (see pooling/assessment strategy below).",0,,False
"Metric(s): For each topic, we define a single Target Set, consisting of the 30 most recent relevant items known. Basic metrics will be recall and precision in relation to the target set. Further metrics might include e.g. F1. Defining a single target set informs the metrics of the optimal behaviour of a retrieval system, which is to retrieve the most recent 30 relevant items, allows the observation of suboptimal behaviour of submitted systems when the items they return in the submitted set are either irrelevant or too old, and makes scores comparable across all submitted runs.",0,,False
"Pooling/assessment strategy: The pooling process is iterative rather than one-off ­ involving further additions to pools after initial items have been judged. The goal of the pooling process is to identify the items in the target set, that is the 30 relevant recent items. The iterative process follows:",1,ad,True

"As mentioned this method guarantees to evaluate all submissions fairly according to the metric, and also provides good material for participants to do diagnostic work on their mixture of relevance and time-like criteria for retrieval. For future use, it identifies what is likely to be a good approximation to the true target set, and also labels for relevance a reasonable number of older items, again helpful for diagnostic work.",0,,False
3. DISCUSSION,0,,False
So far we have only considered binary relevance assessments; often multiple grades are used. In the Microblog,1,ad,True
"Track tweets were judged as non-relevant, relevant, or vital (highly relevant) [1]. A simple way to account for graded relevance in the proposed framework is to define the target set to contain not only the 30 most recent relevant items but also all previous vital items known. This is a rather crude balance between the importance of relevance and time but it allows the measurement process to remain quite simple.",1,Track,True
"Note that the current set up does not prohibit a future definition of a measure that combines relevance and time through some gain function for instance. Under such a development, the submission requirements, as described here, should remain similar with participants submitting an auxiliary list of items ranked by relevance only to allow the construction of a target set/ranking. Further, pruning of the judgment space during pooling should also be possible in a way similar to the one described in the proposal above.",0,,False
"Further it should be also possible to consider giving extra weight to the retrieval of all vital items, but that complicates the metrics somewhat and a discussion on this is out of the scope of the current poster. An extension of set measures to graded relevance can be found in Robertson et al. [2].",1,ad,True
"Another point regarding the proposed experiment is that one could continue adding items to the pool even if no relevant documents are found for a small number of iterations, so that any recent relevant items that appear low in the ranked list by all systems gets a chance to be pooled. The number of iterations that would be required is a point of further investigation on the implementation of the proposed experiment and out of the scope of this poster.",1,ad,True
"Last, note also that set retrieval typically requires ranking and thresholding; thresholding is known to be hard. However, for the task as defined, participants will be able to get away with thresholding at fixed rank (20 or 25 or 30) without disastrously damaging effectiveness. There will be room for more sophisticated thresholding methods to be used.",0,,False
4. CONCLUSION,0,,False
"In this poster we proposed a experiment to test the effectiveness of retrieval systems towards returning both relevant and timely information. We discussed a rather simple case, where relevance is binary and the only measures considered are set measures. Extensions of the proposed experiment for graded relevance, ranking measures are possible and follow the general principles of the proposed framework with somewhat more complex details on the implementation side. The proposed framework resolves the flaw of the current evaluation framework used by the TREC Microblog Track.",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"For increased efficiency, an information retrieval system can split its index into multiple shards, and then replicate these shards across many query servers. For each new query, an appropriate replica for each shard must be selected, such that the query is answered as quickly as possible. Typically, the replica with the lowest number of queued queries is selected. However, not every query takes the same time to execute, particularly if a dynamic pruning strategy is applied by each query server. Hence, the replica's queue length is an inaccurate indicator of the workload of a replica, and can result in inefficient usage of the replicas. In this work, we propose that improved replica selection can be obtained by using query efficiency prediction to measure the expected workload of a replica. Experiments are conducted using 2.2k queries, over various numbers of shards and replicas for the large GOV2 collection. Our results show that query waiting and completion times can be markedly reduced, showing that accurate response time predictions can improve scheduling accuracy and attesting the benefit of the proposed scheduling algorithm.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"A distributed information retrieval (IR) system consists of several query servers, each of them storing the index shard for a subset of the documents in the corpus. New queries arrive at the broker, which routes them to each shard, before collating and merging the results for presentation to the user. The efficiency of each query server can be improved by deploying a dynamic pruning strategy, such as Wand [1], which aims to avoid the scoring of postings for documents that cannot make the top K retrieved set.",0,,False
"While multiple shards increase efficiency compared to a monolithic (""single shard"") retrieval system, the throughput of a distributed retrieval system can be further enhanced by replicating shards, so that one of multiple query servers can provide the results for a single shard [6]. The problem tackled in this work is how a broker should select (schedule) the most suitable replica of a given shard in order to reduce the queue waiting time. For example, the replica with the minimum number of queued queries can be selected.",0,,False
"Copyright is held by the author/owner(s). SIGIR'12, August 12­16, 2012, Portland, Oregon, USA. ACM 978-1-4503-1472-5/12/08.",0,,False
"However, the response time for different queries can vary widely, particularly if dynamic pruning is employed [5]. Hence, the accurate choice of replica is made more difficult, as the number of queries queued by a given query server does not accurately predict the processing backlog of the server. A recently proposed technique for query efficiency prediction [5] offers a plausible manner to estimate the workload of a replica. Hence, we hypothesise that query efficiency prediction [4] can permit accurate query scheduling in a distributed/replicated IR system. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, this work contributes the first study to applying query efficiency predictors for scheduling in a distributed/replicated IR system. Using a simulated distributed/ replicated search environment, based on actual query response times, we experiment to determine how different scheduling algorithms can be deployed for replica selection. Our results show that by using query efficiency prediction, we can improve the selection of replicated query servers, and hence the average query completion times are reduced. For instance, using predicted response time to select between 4 replicas of a 2 shard index results in a 42% reduction in mean completion time compared to selecting replicas by considering only the length of their queues.",1,ad,True
2. SIMULATING REPLICATION,0,,False
"In comparing different scheduling algorithms, we experiment with a various numbers of shards and replicas. To facilitate such experiments without exhaustive hardware resources, we build a simulation framework that supports different distributed settings. Indeed, Cacheda et al. [2] showed that a simulation framework could accurately model the efficiency of a real distributed IR system, including the network delays, the queue waiting and processing time for queries and the time for merging the results. Following this, we implement a simulation framework1, extended to encapsulate the presence of multiple shards each with multiple replicas as well as several scheduling algorithms for selecting replicas. The constants for network delays follow [2], in order to achieve a proven realistic simulation environment.",0,,False
"The baseline scheduling algorithms implemented for selecting replicas are: Random (the replica is chosen randomly); Round Robin (modulo the number of replicas, if replica i was selected for this query, replica i + 1 is used for the next query); Queue Length (the replica with the fewest queries waiting to be processed is selected). In addition to these baselines, we propose Predicted, where the replica with the current shortest queue in terms of predicted response times is selected. We use query efficiency predictions [5]",1,ad,True

"We hypothesise that using predicted response times can increase overall efficiency compared to other scheduling algorithms. To address this hypothesis, we conduct experiments by indexing TREC GOV2 corpus using Terrier2, applying Porter's English stemmer and removing standard stopwords. We experiment with three different index configurations: 2, 5 and 10 shards. For retrieval on each query server, we use a set of 2200 queries of the TREC 2005 Terabyte track Efficiency task. We sample real arrival times of a set of queries from an Excite query log and assign them to our TREC queries (query arrival rates vary from 20 to 180 per second). We use the Wand dynamic pruning strategy [1] to retrieve K ,"" 1000 documents, scored by the DPH Divergence from Randomness document weighting model. Timings are made using an Intel Xeon 2.66GHz.""",1,ad,True
"To obtain the response time predictions, we follow Tonellotto et al. [5], by calculating various term-level statistics, such as the IDF, maximum score, number of postings, number of postings with scores > 95% maximum score. These are then aggregated across terms by sum, max, min, mean, median, stddev, variance and range functions, to form a total of 113 features (14 statistics * 8 aggregations + query length). Predicted response times are obtained by gradient boosted regression trees [3], trained on a separate subset of 2500 Efficiency task queries. Finally, to compare the five scheduling algorithms, we use two measures: average waiting time (AWT) and average completion time (ACT) over all the queries, in milliseconds (ms). Note that the average completion time is inclusive of the average waiting time.",1,ad,True

"From Table 1, we note that increasing both the numbers of shards and the number of replicas reduces both ACTs and",0,,False
2http://terrier.org,0,,False
"AWTs. Indeed, in general, 2 shards with only 2 replicas is insufficient for a low completion time for this query workload, as queries can spend 8 seconds waiting for an available query server. For 5 or more shards, more than 4 replicas is sufficient for eliminating any contention for query servers (i.e. AWTs close to 0).",1,WT,True
"Next, comparing the scheduling algorithms, we note that Random obtains the highest ACTs and AWTs, because it can choose replicas that are busy, whist other replicas for that shard are idle. Queue Length is superior to Round Robin under high contention (i.e. 2 shards, 2 replicas). In other settings, Round Robin appears to better balance load than Queue Length. However, across different numbers of shards and replicas, Prediction always achieves the smallest AWT. For instance, with 4 replicas of the 2 shard index, Prediction can reduce AWT to 3ms, compared to 199ms for Queue Length and 174ms for Round Robin. Under settings with very little contention (e.g. 10 shards, 4 or 8 replicas), Round Robin has slightly lower ACTs than Prediction and even Oracle, due to the expense of predicting the response time (typically 6-40ms, depending on query length). Finally, Prediction obtains ACTs and AWTs that are almost identical to the best-case Oracle algorithm, based on actual response times. Overall, we find that using predicted response times to select the suitable replica for each query results in improved efficiency.",1,WT,True
5. CONCLUSIONS,0,,False
"We proposed that using the predicted response time (obtained using query efficiency prediction) could enhance replica selection within a distributed/replicated IR system, compared to other scheduling algorithms. Indeed, experiments using the GOV2 corpus showed that the proposed Prediction algorithm could attain marked reductions in the query waiting times, across different number of shards and replicas. In future work we will investigate if query response times within a shard are correlated, and hence if the number of replicas required for a given shard can be predicted in advance.",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Previous studies of web search result examination have provided valuable insights in understanding and modelling searcher behavior. Yet, recent work (e.g., [3]) has been developed based on the assumption that the time a searcher spends examining a particular result abstract or snippet, correlates with result relevance. While this idea is intuitively attractive, to the best of our knowledge it has not been empirically tested. This poster investigates this hypothesis empirically, in a controlled setting, using eye tracking equipment to compare search result examination time with result relevance. Interestingly, while we replicate previous findings showing examination time to be indicative of whole-page relevance, we find that viewing time of individual results alone is a poor indicator of either absolute result relevance or even of pairwise preferences. Our results should not be taken as negating the usefulness of modeling searcher examination behavior, but rather to emphasize that snippet examination time is not in itself a good indicator of relevance.",0,,False

"As terabytes of search log data are being generated daily, correct interpretation of patterns in these data becomes ever more challenging. Mining of click data has become a fertile area for many applications, including result relevance estimation, automatic query suggestion, and many others. One interesting application of using search logs to infer result examination behavior on Search Result Pages (SERP) was introduced by He et al. [3]. Another successful application of examination data is identification of relevant sub-parts of documents, which can be used for query expansion or term re-weighting (see Buscher et al. [1] for more details). Yet, while result examination data is likely to provide rich contextual information for machine learning algorithms for accurate user modeling and interpretation of past clicks, to our knowledge, the examination behavior on the SERP itself as a predictor of relevance has not been empirically evaluated in prior research [3].",0,,False

"viewing time of a search result snippet can be directly used to estimate its relevance label. Using eye tracking equipment, we confirm that previously suggested measures of viewing behavior (e.g., the distribution of viewing time across all result ranks) indeed correlate with overall result quality. However, we also find that examination time alone is unlikely to be a good indicator of relevance of individual results, primarily due to severe position bias in the examination behavior. Our results are consistent with and complement the findings of Guan and Cutrell [2], where users were observed to spend more time finding relevant results placed in the bottom of the result list, as opposed to the original result ordering. Next, we describe the details of eye tracking user study that we conducted, after what we present our findings on correlating result viewing time and relevance, both for the whole set of results and for individual search results.",0,,False

"to spend more time reading top results irrespective to the result relevance is well known and typically referred as position bias (sometimes called presentation bias). However, when considering viewing time for individual queries, the effect of the position bias is smaller. In fact, for some of the queries in our dataset, the viewing time does not peak at rank one, and actually can be used to estimate the whole page relevance, as we discuss below. Viewing time vs. individual result relevance: we now investigate whether variation in snippet examination time, as measured per result or by entire distribution, could be attributed to result relevance. Figure 1 reports the box plot of relative viewing time, broken down by relevance labels, where the boxes correspond to 25th and 75th percentiles, and the median is marked with a red line. As Figure 1 reports, there is a substantial overlap in values of viewing time for different relevance levels. Statistical tests on differences of result viewing time between Bad and Partially Relevant groups, and Bad and Perfect groups fail to reject the null hypothesis, leading us to conclude that snippet examination time alone can not be used to infer individual result relevance. To verify our findings, we pool viewing time and relevance labels from all queries, and compute Pearson correlation between them. Overall, we find that there is only a weak correlation (0.157) between snippet viewing time and relevance. In order to mitigate the effects of position bias, we also compared relative result preferences based on relevance vs. based on the difference in examination time. Specifically, we compared the differences of snippet viewing time per result to the differences in relevance levels, in three ways: Pairwise-All, pairwise preferences derived based on all (usually 10) results on the SERP; Pairwise-Above, pairwise preferences between each result and only the results ranked above it; Pairwise-Adjacent, pairwise preferences between adjacent results only. Surprisingly, as reported in Table 1, we find that even pairwise preferences do not exhibit a stronger correlation with viewing time, except for PairwiseAll, where pairwise preferences have a higher correlation with viewing time compared to using the absolute document relevance. Additionally, we re-calculated these correlation coefficients using absolute viewing time, instead of the relative viewing time. Finally, we repeated our computations and considered only the results viewed at least once, without finding significantly higher correlation levels. We omit details on these experiments due to space constraints.",1,ad,True
"Viewing time distribution vs. whole page relevance: while viewing time on individual results is a poor predictor of relevance, we also investigated whether we can relate viewing behavior on the SERP as a whole, with result relevance of the whole result set. To quantify overall page quality we calculated standard information retrieval metrics, namlely: Mean Average Precision (MAP), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Expected Reciprocal Rank (ERR).

"result abstracts at lower ranks. To validate our intuition we compute correlation between relative viewing time at rank one (Views@1) and mean rank of viewing time distribution (analog of distribution mean). Note that the relative Views@1 is linearly depended on viewing time at lower ranks (due to normalization constraint), hence when more attention is spent on lower ranks, the value of Views@1 decreases. Table 2 reports Person correlation between Views@1 and mean rank and whole page quality represented by one of the three metrics above. We find that Views@1 has substantial correlation of 0.452 with the MAP metric, while exhibiting smaller, but non-negligible correlation with NDCG (0.249) and to a smaller degree with ERR (0.102). Summary: to our knowledge, we performed the first empirical examination of the result examination hypothesis, disproving the intuition that longer snippet examination times indicate higher relevance of individual results. Surprisingly, this was the case both for absolute relevance levels, and for pairwise result preferences, under commonly observed strategies of result examination (i.e., the ""Skip-Above"" and ""Skip-Next"" strategies in reference [4]). However, we confirmed that the distribution of the viewing times on the SERP does correlate with ranking quality of the SERP as a whole, suggesting a more promising direction for further research. In our future work we plan to conduct more thorough analysis on result examination behavior and associated relevance that would account for consistent biases in result perception such as abstract length and judgeability.",1,MAP,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Aggregating search results from a variety of heterogeneous sources or verticals such as news, image and video into a single interface is a popular paradigm in web search. Although various approaches exist for selecting relevant verticals or optimising the aggregated search result page, evaluating the quality of an aggregated page is an open question. This paper proposes a general framework for evaluating the quality of aggregated search pages. We evaluate our approach by collecting annotated user preferences over a set of aggregated search pages for 56 topics and 12 verticals. We empirically demonstrate the fidelity of metrics instantiated from our proposed framework by showing that they strongly agree with the annotated user preferences of pairs of simulated aggregated pages. Furthermore, we show that our metrics agree with the majority user preference more often than the current diversity-based information retrieval metrics. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by showing that personalised historical preference data can improve the performance of our proposed metrics.",1,ad,True

"a set of specific verticals dispersed throughout the standard ""general web"" results, for example by adding image results to the ten blue links for the query ""pictures of flowers"". This new search paradigm is often known as aggregated search [4]. The three main challenges that arise in realising such systems are vertical selection (VS), item selection (IS), and result presentation (RP). Vertical selection deals with deciding which verticals are implicitly intended by a query. Item selection deals with selecting a subset of items from each vertical to present on the aggregated page. Result presentation deals with organising and embedding the various types of items on the result page. The most common presentation strategy for aggregated search is to merge the results into one ranked list of so-called blocks, and is now the `de facto' standard in many search engines.",1,ad,True
"Although various approaches exist for selecting relevant verticals [4, 5] and for optimising aggregated search pages [2, 17], evaluating the quality of aggregated search pages is still a challenge. Consider the query ""yoga poses"" which suggests that a visual element in the result page would be useful to many users. Furthermore consider that 75% of users who issue this query would prefer ""image"" results, 60% would prefer ""video"" results, and 10% would prefer ""news"" results, to ""general web"" results. Figure 1 shows three possible aggregated search pages1 (A, B, and C) for the sample query. It is clearly difficult to objectively ascertain the aggregated search page that represents a more effective returned set, as there are a variety of compounding factors that could affect a user preference. A user may prefer a page because of his/her preference towards a specific vertical (vertical preference). In such a case, a user may prefer page A because it contains more images. A user who prefers a result set with more items that are topically relevant might prefer page C, whereas a user who prefers more relevant items towards the top of the page (presentation preference) might prefer page B. Furthermore, a user who desires a more diverse returned set (vertical diversity) may prefer page C. Any combination of those factors can influence the perceived quality and user preference of the pages.",0,,False

2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
"Various works evaluating one component of an aggregated search system in isolation exist. Vertical selection in aggregated search has been studied in [4, 5, 15, 26]. Much of this research aims to measure the quality of the set of selected verticals, compared with an annotated set obtained by collecting manual labels from assessors [4, 5, 26] or derived from user interaction data [15]. The annotation can be binary [4, 5] or graded [26]. The quality of a particular vertical selection approach is mostly evaluated with standard measures of precision and recall using the binary annotated set. Our work also evaluates this key component by utilising graded vertical-orientation information derived from a multi-assessor preferred vertical annotation set [26], as this allows for a more refined evaluation scheme.",1,ad,True

"quality. For example, [17] evaluate the utility of a page based on a user engagement metric (CTR). This evaluation framework requires large-scale user interaction data, which may not always be available. In addition, it is not feasible to collect user interaction data for all possible page combinations. Others [6] evaluate the utility of the page by asking annotators to make assessments based on a number of criteria (e.g. relevance, diversity). Although this work is a comprehensive way to evaluate aggregated pages, it remains costly to gather assessments for all possible aggregated pages.",1,ad,True
"The most similar work [3] to ours collects preferences on block pairs from users and measures the page quality by calculating the distance between the page in question and the ideal (reference) page; the shorter the distance, the better the page. One advantage is that any possible combination of vertical blocks that form an aggregated page can be tested, from a block-oriented point of view (without regard to item selection). However, when the results retrieved for a vertical (block) change, the assessments previously gathered may not be reusable, as the preference will undoubtedly change accordingly. As our work follows the Cranfield paradigm, once the assessments (both item topical-relevance and verticalorientation) are gathered, it can be applied to evaluate any possible aggregated search page (any combination of vertical selection, item selection and result presentation). Therefore, our work leads to a more robust, inexpensive, and reusable approach for evaluating aggregated search pages.",1,ad,True
"Topical diversity is an important topic. Various diversityaware IR metrics have been proposed [8, 10, 18], capturing the importance of each subtopic, the degree to which an item represents the subtopic, and the topical-relevance of the item. Diversity-based metrics can promote returned sets that are both topically relevant and diverse. A simplistic way of adapting these metrics to aggregated search is to treat subtopics as verticals and subtopic importance as verticalorientation. In this way, all existing diversity-based IR metrics can be adapted to evaluate aggregated search. Although in principle suitable to evaluate aggregated search, diversitybased metrics are not appropriate for use with block-based pages where user behaviour is different; for instance user browsing behavior within a block containing images may be different to that within a block containing ""general web"" results. Furthermore, the various types of items (text, image, etc.) that need to be accounted for in an aggregated search scenario are not explicitly modelled in diversity-based met-",1,ad,True

3. PROBLEM FORMULATION,0,,False
We introduce some formal notation and outline some of the main assumptions used throughout this work.,0,,False
3.1 Aggregated Page Composition,0,,False
"An aggregated search page P is composed of a set of blocks {B1, B2, ...Bn}, where each block Bi consists of a set of items {Ii1, Ii2, ...Iim}. An item can be a ""general web"" page or a vertical result. Only snippets of each item appear on the aggregated search page. We make several assumptions2 about the page P : (i) results are presented into blocks from top to bottom, and within each block, items are shown either from left to right (Image, Video) or from top to bottom (News, Recipe); (ii) each block Bi consists of items originating from only one vertical; (iii) only one block of each type is placed on a page (with the exception of ""general web"" blocks); and (iv) a block consists of one `general web' item or k vertical items. This is different to previous work [3, 17] where vertical block could be embedded into only three positions of ""general web"" results (top of the page, middle of the page, bottom of the page). We relax this assumption and allow a vertical block to be slotted between any two ""general web"" blocks on the page.",1,Video,True
3.2 Relevance and Orientation,0,,False
"Our objective is to develop metrics that measure the quality of any possible aggregated search page. The metrics must work regardless of the selected verticals, the items retrieved from each vertical, and where the vertical results are positioned on the page. To achieve this, we assume that the following two types of relevance assessments are available:",0,,False
"· The topical-relevance of each item, which is an assessment indicating whether a given item Iij within block Bi is topically relevant to a topic q3. This is denoted qrel(Iij |q).",0,,False
"· The user specific vertical-orientation [26], which is a value between zero and one indicating the fraction of users that prefer a page to contain items from the vertical Vi rather than ""general web"" results for a topic q. This is denoted orient(Vi|W, q).",0,,False
The two relevance assessments are assumed to be made independently. The concept of vertical-orientation [26] reflects the perceived usefulness of a vertical from the user perspective prior to viewing vertical results and without regard to the quality of the vertical results. The vertical-orientation assessment is obtained by comparing each vertical in turn to,1,ad,True
"2These assumptions are made in accordance with existing aggregated search systems. 3In this work, we assume that topical-relevance assessments are binary.",1,ad,True
"the reference ""general web"" vertical, by asking users whether items from this vertical are likely to improve the quality of a standard web page. Consequently, the vertical orientation of the Web (orient(W |W, q)) is deemed to be 0.5, as we can imagine that a user would randomly select a page when presented with two similar ""general web"" pages. The topical-relevance assessment of each item contributes to the measurement of relevance for each retrieved result. This type of assessment can be made using similar pooling techniques [13] to those used in TREC.",1,ad,True
"With these two assessment types, we assume that a user obtain the highest reward by reading the most topically relevant item, originating from the most highly oriented vertical, first. With this assumption, only the vertical (or verticals) with a higher orientation than the ""general web"" (orient(V |W, q) > 0.5) should be presented on the aggregated search page; all other verticals should be suppressed.",1,ad,True
3.3 User Interaction Behaviour,0,,False
We make some assumptions about how users interact with an aggregated search page P :,0,,False
"· The user examines each page one block at a time. When the user reads page P , a block Bi on the page P has a certain probability of being examined. This probability denoted Exam(Bi) is estimated depending on the type of browsing model assumed.",1,ad,True
"· After the user decides to examine a block Bi, we assume a static user browsing behavior within the block; the user reads all the items Ii1 to Iim within that block.",1,ad,True
"Given that our metrics are based on average user and that there is usually only a limited number of items per block, this simple within block user browsing model is appropriate.",0,,False
4. EVALUATION FRAMEWORK,0,,False
"We aim to develop metrics that evaluate an aggregated search page similarly to how a user might. Given two pages P1 and P2, we wish to measure their effectiveness in satisfying a user information need using a utility function U til(P ). If a user prefers P1 over P2 for a given query, the utility measure should lead to U til(P1) > U til(P2).",1,ad,True
"Following [11], the utility of a page is determined by reward and effort. A page with a high utility should satisfy the average user information need with relatively little effort. We define the utility metric U til(P ) of the page P based on all blocks {B1, B2, ...Bn} on the page. When a user reads page P , a block Bi on the page P has a certain probability Exam(Bi) of being examined. This probability might depend on the position of the block presented, the snippet type of the items (image, text) within the block, or the satisfaction level after reading previous blocks B1 to Bi-1. The probability Exam(Bi) can be estimated depending on the type of browsing model assumed.",1,ad,True
"After the user decides to read block Bi, he/she will be rewarded with some gain G(Bi) coming from reading all the items Ii1 to Iim within that block. Here we assume that the topical-relevance of the item snippet is a good indication of the relevance of the item itself. Therefore, by reading all the items within the block Bi, the user will also have spent some effort E(Bi) in reading this block.

Several models exist [8, 9, 16] that aim to predict the probability with which a user will examine an item. Position models [16] use only the position of the item in a result set. The cascade model [8] uses the relevance of the items previously examined, the intuition being that a sufficiently satisfied user will not continue to examine extra items. Motivated by the fact that users tend to be attracted by vertical results and the visual attention on them will increase the examination probability of other nearby web results, the attention model [9] aims to capture the visual attractiveness of the page. We do not propose a new user browsing model for aggregated search. Rather, we adopt these different models and incorporate them into our framework, namely the position examination models DCG [12] and RBP [16], the cascade model ERR [8], and the attention model ATT [9].",1,ad,True

The utility metrics must be normalised by the ideal aggregated page. To obtain the latter, we require a brute-force approach that calculates the metric score for all pages, and then selects the page with the maximal score as the ideal page (arg max(U til(P ))P ). This approach is not viable, given the number of possible combinations of various components of aggregated search. Therefore, we use a greedy algorithm to select a subset of aggregated pages from all the pages that exist, and only select the optimal page from this set.

The verticals are created either by classifying items in the web collections into different genres (e.g. Blog, News) or by adding items from other multimedia collection (e.g. Image, Video).

5.2 Simulating Aggregated Search Pages,0,,False
"For each topic, we simulate a set of aggregated search pages. As indicated in Section 3, we assume that a page consists of ten ""general web"" blocks (one ""general web"" page is a block) and up to three vertical blocks dispersed throughout those ten blocks (where each vertical block consists of a fixed number of three items). Recall that there are three key components of an aggregated search system that can be varied: (i) Vertical Selection (VS); (ii) Item Selection (IS); and (iii) Result Presentation (RP). We generate pages by simulating an aggregated search system in which the three components vary in quality.",0,,False
"The assessments for vertical-orientation were created by gathering annotations across several users. For the process of varying VS, for a given vertical Vi and query q, we consider the vertical to have a high vertical orientation if orient(Vi|W, q) is greater than 0.75 5. We simulate four different vertical selection strategies, namely Perfect, ReDDE, CORI, Bad. Perfect selects all the highly oriented verticals, while Bad randomly selects the maximum number (three) of lowly oriented verticals. ReDDE and CORI rank the verticals according to the ReDDE [21] and CORI [7] resource selection approaches, and select the top K ranked verticals.",1,ad,True
"5We select the threshold as 0.75 as 75% assessors majority preference is a suitable percentage whereby the assessments are neither too noisy (50%) or stringent (100%). Furthermore, it creates a vertical intent distribution across the topics that realistically conforms to the real-world [4].",0,,False
"For IS we simulate three potentially different levels of relevance. These are Perfect, BM25, and TF. Perfect selects all items in the vertical that are topically relevant. BM25 and TF select the top three ranked items from the rankings provided by the BM25 and a simple TF (term frequency) weighting respectively, with the PageRank score as a prior for both BM25 and TF.",0,,False
"For RP, we simulate three different result presentation approaches: Perfect, Random and Bad. Perfect places the vertical blocks on the page so that gain could potentially be maximised, i.e. all the relevant items are placed before nonrelevant items. However, if these items are part of a vertical, we position the highest orientated vertical first. Random randomly disperses the vertical blocks on the page while maintaining the position of the ""general web"" blocks. Bad reverses the perfectly presented page.",1,ad,True
"By varying the quality of each of the three key components, we can vary the quality of the result pages created by an aggregated search system in a more controlled way. For each topic, we can create 36 (4 × 3 × 3) pages6. In addition, the snippet of each item is automatically generated by the Lemur Toolkit and the presentation style conforms with typical search page presentation (presenting the vertical name in front of vertical results). Using this approach we can create a near ideal aggregated page for a query by using Perfect VS, Perfect IS, and Perfect RP. This is a greedy approach to the problem and is used as our method of normalisation for nU til.",1,ad,True
5.3 Constructing and Selecting Page Pairs,0,,False
"We now describe the selection of page pairs so that they can be presented to a user for judgment. One way to achieve this is to randomly sample two aggregated search pages, and collect a sufficient set of user preference judgments. However, following [3], we attempt a broad categorisation of the aggregated search pages into ""bins"" according to page quality, i.e. H (High), M (Middle) and L (Low). We can then provide a more in depth analysis of the performance of the metrics over different regions of the page space.",1,ad,True

"the components that created the page. We estimate this by assuming that the three components contribute equal importance to the quality of the page. We then evaluate each component respectively using a suitable metric. The quality score of the page is determined by linearly combining the metric score for each component. This is a coarse approach of determining the quality of the page. We use the F-measure (VS), Mean Precision (IS), and Kendall-tau correlation (RP). We then rank all the pages according to the three linearly combined metrics and evenly categorise the pages in the ranking into ""H"", ""M"" and ""L"" bin respectively.",0,,False
"We now have a method of comprehensively analysing how various metrics perform over the whole page space by selecting pages from these pre-assigned bins. Specifically, we have six bin pairs, H-H, H-M, H-L, M-M, M-L, L-L, which uniformly represent all the entire page space for the queries (albeit in coarse intervals). For each pair of bins, we randomly select 8 page pairs from it. Consequently, we select in total 48 (6 × 8) page pairs for each topic.",0,,False
5.4 Collecting Pairwise Preference Assessments,0,,False
"Our preference assessment data is collected over the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing platform, where each worker was compensated $0.01 for each assessment made. A page pair was presented with the topic (title and description) shown in the upper position of the assessment page. This was followed by a pair of aggregated pages shown sideby-side. The assessor was provided with three options when making the assessments: ""left page is better"", ""right page is better"" and ""both are bad"". The latter option captures the scenario where a user is confused due to the poor page quality7. For each page pair, we collect four assessments (from four different assessors). The total number of assessments made during this preference collection process was 10752 (56 × 48 × 4). Following [19], a quality control was ensured by including 500 ""trap"" HITs. Each ""trap"" HIT consists of a triplet (q, i, j) where either page i or j was taken from a query other than q. We interpreted an assessor preferring the set of extraneous results as evidence of malicious or careless assessments and assessors who failed more than two trap HITs were discarded.",1,ad,True
5.5 Analysis of Assessments,0,,False
"Of the 203 assessors who contributed HITs, 39 had their assessments removed from the assessment pool due to failing more than 2 trap HITs. For the remaining 164/203, participation followed a power law distribution where about 12% (20/164) of the assessors completed about 60% (6522/10752) of our HITs. We also found out that assessors rarely select the ""both are bad"" options provided as only 7% (684/10752) of the assessments are of this option.",1,ad,True
"We want to answer the following question: RQ1 Do users agree with each other when assessing aggregated search pairs? Therefore, we measured annotator agreement of preferences of aggregated page pairs using Fleiss' Kappa [24] (denoted by KF ), which corrects for agreement due to chance. Fleiss' Kappa is convenient because it ignores the identity of the assessor-pair, and is designed to measure agreement over instances labeled by different (even disjoint) sets of assessors. The results are shown in Table 5.",0,,False

This result is similar to previous research [3, 26], which reaffirm that evaluating aggregated search is not an easy task, and that various users have their own assumptions about what a good page is. Of all 10752 aggregated page-pairs, 8051 (74.8%) had a majority preference of at least 3/4 and only 2231 (20.7%) had a perfect 4/4 majority preference. It is perhaps not surprising that assessor agreement is not high as agreement on page-pairs requires that assessors make similar assumptions about the cost of different types of errors. Furthermore, the low inter-assessor agreement may be explained by the fact that users make different assumptions regarding the importance of each aggregated search component (VS, IS, RP). Alternatively, it may be that assessors have a hard time distinguishing between good presentations. Following previous research [3], given this low level of inter-assessor agreement, rather than focusing on the metrics agreement with each individual preference, we focus on their agreement with the majority preference (3/4 or greater, and 4/4) in the evaluation.""",1,ad,True

We select the latter as they are the most prevalent user-oriented IR metrics.

A two-tailed t-test (significant at the p < 0.01 level, denoted by or ) is used to show which metric correlates more significantly with the user preferences9.",0,,False
6.1 Standard Parameter Settings,0,,False
"To answer RQ2, we carry out a set of experiments where we employ the prevalent standard parameter settings for the metrics used in IR experiments. We utilise the standard log discount function for all DCG related metrics (ASDCG, nDCG, -nDCG, D-nDCG and D#-nDCG). We set the  parameter in -nDCG to 0.5 and  to 0.5 for D#-nDCG. For our proposed metrics, we set  , 10 (a linearly increasing vertical-orientation function) and i ,"" 0.0 (no personalised vertical diversity preference) as the standard parameters. For the user persistence parameter in ASRBP , we set  "", 0.8 as this value best correlates with the user browsing behavior from a real-world query-log data [16]. These standard settings instantiate a simple metric (e.g. ASDCG) similar to existing topical diversity-aware metrics that incorporate subtopic importance probability (D-nDCG). The standard  of ASAT T is obtained by exploring the optimal setting in a development set that contained 500 preference page pairs that contain visually attractive results (results coming from Image and Video).",1,corpora,True
"Our evaluation, the fidelity of the metrics, thus focuses on the agreement (of each metric) with the user preferences over the set of aggregated search results. As we have already categorised page pairs into various quality ""bins"" (H-H, HM, H-L, M-M, M-L, L-L), we report the experimental results over different bin pairs, in order to understand each metric performance over the whole evaluation space. Our experiments have two parts: (i) when fixing the assumed user browsing model (e.g. DCG), we compare the performance of our proposed metrics with existing IR metrics; (ii) under the proposed framework, we compare user models to investigate which ones make more accurate prediction of the user preferences on aggregated page pairs.",1,ad,True
6.1.1 Comparison of Metrics,0,,False
"We present results for a majority preference of 3/4 or greater, or 4/4, in Table 6. The significance is calculated in comparison with one of the proposed metrics, ASDCG. Our metrics have higher agreement with user preferences for the H-M, H-L and M-L bins compared to the less discriminative bins (H-H, M-M, or L-L). In addition, for page pairs with higher majority user agreement (4/4 instead of 3/4), our metrics tend to make more accurate prediction of the user preferences. After closer examination, we observe that the metrics agreement with the majority user preference is higher on pairs where there is greater consensus between assessors. This is similar to reported in [3].",1,ad,True
We also observe that overall the proposed aggregated search metrics (ASDCG) work better than existing IR metrics (nDCG,0,,False

"and P @10). They have a significantly better performance across almost the entire metric space. This is not surprising given that the proposed metrics incorporate aspects unique to aggregated search (vertical-orientation), which can affect user preferences. Indeed, when the page quality is expected to be high, traditional IR metrics that do not consider vertical-orientation perform worse than the proposed metrics. But it is worth noting that nDCG performs significantly better than other metrics on L-L page pairs. This might be because as the returned verticals are of low orientation, and for these types of page pairs, simply measuring topical relevance of items might correlate more with the user browsing behavior than considering the additional vertical orientation; when assessing two low-quality pages, the user is trying to find more topically relevant items, without regard to the orientation of the vertical.",1,corpora,True
"For the diversity-aware metric, -nDCG performs significantly worse than the proposed metrics. This is because nDCG implicitly penalises the within vertical redundancy of items. This evaluation strategy is not appropriate when presenting results from the same vertical in a block. A close examination shows that this degraded performance is due to the over-penalisation for items within each vertical. Although recent research [14] has suggested that  may be tuned on a per query basis to either promote or discount extra items from the same sub-topic (vertical), we leave this for future work. In addition, instead of fully utilising the graded orient(V |W, q) information, -nDCG treats relevant verticals in a binary sense, another reason that may cause the degraded performance.",1,ad,True
"The other existing diversity-aware metric D-nDCG performs comparably well. This is not surprising as when employed with standard parameter setting, D-nDCG is most similar to the proposed aggregated search metrics (ASDCG). The major difference is that ASDCG captures the effort of examining result snippets of different types. D#-nDCG performs significantly worse than D-nDCG over the entire simulated page space used for evaluation in the context of aggregated search. This proves that simply promoting vertical diversity without considering vertical-orientation can degrade the evaluation performance. In addition, as we will see later, because of the various users vertical diversity preference, personalised vertical diversity can be a better strategy for the evaluation of aggregated search. Finally, IA-nDCG also performs considerably worse than ASDCG. A close examination suggests that this is due to the over-rewarding of the vertical results in a page.",1,ad,True
"When we assume a uniform effort distribution of the resulting snippets, which can be of various types, the metric performances decrease from 67.3% to 65.6%. However, this decrease is not statistically significant. This might be due to the small number of topics promoting image or video vertical results.

"We further see that comparatively ASERR performs better on H-M and H-L bins and worse on others. The degraded performance might be due to the fact that only binary topical-relevance assessments (of items) are available and the metric largely rewards the top relevant results. This also partly explains why ASERR performs particularly well between high quality pages (highly oriented and relevant results are presented at the top of the page) and low quality pages. It is most likely that instead of considering the entire page, most assessors looked only at the early results of the page when assessing.",1,ad,True
"However, surprisingly, by incorporating attention bias (of visually attractive vertical results) into the position-based model, the performance of the metric ASAT T degrades, compared with ASDCG. This might be due to the inaccurate estimation of the attention bias  from our small-scale experiments. After closer examination, it may be that assessors have a considerable preference bias on pages that contain visually attractive results (image, video) [3]. Therefore, the preference assessment between pages containing image and video verticals may be noisier, which could result in a natural bias for those types. Further experiments are needed to explain and understand this bias and its effect.",1,corpora,True
"In comparing ASDCG and ASRBP , although it is observed that ASRBP performs slightly better for page pairs consisting of pages with high quality agreements, the result is not significant.

We recall that ASRBP has three parameters:  that controls the degree to which vertical orientation is rewarded;  that controls the user browsing behavior in terms of user persistence; and i that controls the degree to which a user prefers a diverse aggregated page.",1,ad,True
"Training is done in two stages. First, we learn suitable values for  and  independently of i. We categorised the user preference data into five sets and use five-fold cross validation for training and testing. We set i , 0.0 (users do not prefer vertical-based diverse results unless the vertical provides better results) and iterate through different settings of values:  (from 1 to 100) and  (from 0.5 to 1.0). The optimal combination is obtained with  , 7.0 and  ,"" 0.85 indicating that users generally favour results that contain highly-oriented verticals, and that users do not have a persistent browsing behaviour (they care more about the results returned in a high position in the page). The corresponding results are shown in Table 8. The performance of the metric is improved over the standard parameter settings from 67.7% to 72.6%. This improvement is due to the better estimation of two parameters  and  concerned with two main aspects of aggregated search, vertical selection and result presentation. By learning from historical data, ASRBP (and other metrics) can better capture these two aspects. Second, we fix the optimal settings for  and  and learn personalised""",0,,False

The optimal setting for i varies from 0.15 to 0.4 among different assessors whereas the average optimal setting for those assessors is 0.23. Similar to [26], this demonstrates that each user has his/her own understanding and preference over the diversity of the results. We can report that by using this personalised parameter, the prediction of the metric agreement with the majority of user preference is improved significantly, from 72.6% to 75.9%. This effectively illustrates that aggregated search can be improved if we have a better understanding of each user preference over the diversity of results. This is particularly useful for systems that can gather personalised interaction data for their users.",1,ad,True
7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK,0,,False
"We introduced a general evaluation framework that captures several traits unique to aggregated search. We instantiated a suite of metrics for evaluating aggregated search pages from this framework. We presented a methodology to collect user preferences over aggregated pages, which allowed us to measure various aspects of our proposed metrics. We did this by simulating aggregated search pages of different quality for a range of topics. The approach allowed us to analyse different parts of the aggregated page pair space. Furthermore, we showed that the proposed metrics correlate well with the majority user preferences and that traditional IR metrics are not well suited to the task. In addition, while some diversity-based metrics can be adapted to measure the preference between page pair, they are not ideal. By instantiating several non-tuned versions of metrics from our framework, we showed that these metrics are at least comparable to diversity-based IR metrics. We also showed that our metrics have the ability to tune their behaviour for pages for which personalised preference data is available.",1,ad,True
"Future work will involve extending and setting several parameters of the metrics so that they more closely correlate with user preferences for the sets of page pairs. In particular, when query-log data is available, we can further extend the framework by proposing new user browsing models for aggregated search and investigate their values. We will also devise new approaches to utilise the available implicit user feedback data to better estimate the parameters. Another interesting challenge will be to compare the effectiveness and weakness of existing diversity-aware metrics for evaluating aggregated search, and study the ability of our framework",0,,False

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"When human assessors judge documents for their relevance to a search topic, it is possible for errors in judging to occur. As part of the analysis of the data collected from a 48 participant user study, we have discovered that when the participants made relevance judgments, the average participant spent more time to make errorful judgments than to make correct judgments. Thus, in relevance assessing scenarios similar to our user study, it may be possible to use the time taken to judge a document as an indicator of assessor error. Such an indicator could be used to identify documents that are candidates for adjudication or reassessment.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"We have two motivations for wanting to better understand assessor behavior and assessor error. First, knowledge of assessor behavior should help IR researchers in the construction of more accurate relevance assessing systems. Second, while traditional retrieval metrics are relatively insensitive to assessor error [6], newer metrics that sample documents for judging, can be dramatically affected by assessor error [1, 7]. A single sampled document can represent thousands of documents in the final estimation, and a single document falsely judged to be relevant can greatly inflate the estimated number of relevant documents. Being able to predict which documents might have incorrect judgments could be useful for improving assessor consistency by asking assessors to judge certain documents a second time [1].",1,ad,True
"We have previously reported on relevance judging errors made by the 48 participants who took part in our user study [5], but we have not previously reported on what behaviors correlate with errors.",1,ad,True
"In this paper, we present results for a relevance assessing scenario where there was not an incentive for users to work faster. In this scenario, where the assessor is not paid per judgment, but is paid for the time spent, we have found an interesting result: users take more time to make mistakes than they do to make correct relevance judgments.",0,,False

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS,0,,False
"The user study presented participants with fixed ranked lists of documents. Given a ranked list, participants were instructed to search for and save relevant documents. The user interface was web-based and consisted of two web pages. The first page showed 10 document summaries in a format similar to a web search engine's results page. Clicking on a summary took the participant to a page that displayed the full document and allowed the participant to save the document as relevant. We did not require relevance judgments to be made. We treat viewing a full a document and not saving it as a decision to judge the document as non-relevant. Participants could view the next 10 results by clicking on a link at the bottom of the document summaries page.",1,ad,True
The study used 8 topics from the 2005 TREC Robust track. The documents came from the AQUAINT newswire collection. Each participant searched ranked lists with a uniform precision of 0.6 or 0.3. We use the NIST relevance judgments as truth.,1,TREC,True
Participants worked on 4 search topics for 10 minutes each. The study used a fully balanced design. Participants were instructed to work as fast as possible while making as few mistakes as possible. We use data from the second phase of the study. All participants had already completed phase 1 of the study and gained experience with relevance judging before participating in the second phase. The result lists contained near-duplicate documents. We use only the first judgment on a set of near-duplicates.,1,ad,True
"We measured the time the participants spent on the full document page before saving the document as relevant or leaving the page. It is well-known that large variations in behavior are caused by the search topic and the user. To allow comparisons of times across users and topics, we standardized a participant's times on a topic to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1.",0,,False

"We found that on average, participants took significantly longer to judge documents when they made an error compared to when they were correct in their judgment. A priori, one might guess that participants would make errors by not taking enough time, but in contrast, we find here that time appears to indicate difficulty in making a correct judgment.",1,ad,True
"We hypothesize that the study participants make judgment errors according to the following process. First the participants identify a topically relevant document based on the document's summary and then click on the summary to view the full document. Participants then study the document to determine if it is relevant or not to the specifics of the search topic. The more difficult it is to determine the document's relevance, the longer the participant takes. At some point, the participant decides to save the document as relevant or abandon the document without saving it. False negatives result from not finding the relevant material in the document, and false positives are the result of the final decision being a guess.",0,,False
"There are many other factors that can cause a user to take longer to judge a document. For example, we have shown that the longer a document, the longer it takes to judge its relevance [3]. Is it just that mistakes are being made on longer documents? To investigate this, we modeled the probability that a judgment was an error using logistic regression. For the model, we considered time, document length measured in words, and the rank of the document in the results list. We found that when both time and document length were used together in the model, document length was not a useful predictor of errors. On the other hand, when we included the interaction between time and document length, this interaction was helpful. In other",1,ad,True
"words, if the time to judge is too long given the length of the document, this is an indicator of error. We also found that ranks above about 50 were predictive of making errors. Reaching a rank over 50 in 10 minutes is likely indicative of a participant who is not carefully judging documents. For ranks less than 50, rank was not predictive of errors.",0,,False
"The relevance assessing setup may have a significant effect on assessor behavior. In preliminary analyses of separate studies where assessors had an incentive to work faster [4] and relevant documents were highly prevalent (90% relevant) [2], we have seen false negatives be long errors and false positives be short errors. In this paper, both types of errors were long errors. In future work we intend to analyze these studies in more detail by using this paper's method of standardizing times.",1,ad,True

"We found in a relevance assessing scenario where the assessor is trusted and paid by time spent, and not by number of judgments made, that all things equal, the longer an assessor takes to make a relevance judging decision, the more likely a mistake will be made. We hypothesize that time to judge a document relative to other documents, gives an indication of the difficulty of judging the document.",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"We give a fresh look into score normalization for merging result-lists, isolating the problem from other components. We focus on three of the simplest, practical, and widelyused linear methods which do not require any training data, i.e. MinMax, Sum, and Z-Score. We provide theoretical arguments on why and when the methods work, and evaluate them experimentally. We find that MinMax is the most robust under many circumstances, and that Sum is-- in contrast to previous literature--the worst. Based on the insights gained, we propose another three simple methods which work as good or better than the baselines.",0,,False

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Merging ranked-lists produced by several engines requires two steps: score normalization and combination. In distributed setups with disjoint collections, the combination step becomes trivial since each document is assigned a single score from one of the participating engines. This makes such setups ideal in isolating the normalization problem. Distributed setups usually include another step before normalization, i.e. resource selection (RS). While useful in improving efficiency, RS has been also shown to improve effectiveness significantly. We argue that this is due to the far-fromperfect quality of state-of-the-art normalization methods: in an ideal normalization, e.g. scores are normalized to probabilities of relevance, any kind of RS will hurt effectiveness by excluding sources with relevant documents; in such an ideal situation, the more systems one combines, the better the effectiveness. Consequently, the theoretical ceiling of effectiveness can only be achieved with an ideal normalization without RS, and distributed setups with disjoint collections are best for experimenting with normalization [1].",0,,False

"lem as we described above [3, 4, 5]. We give a fresh look into the simplest normalization methods: linear functions which do not require any training or search engine cooperation. Being the most practical, they are also the fastest and generally have been proved to be robust and effective. Beyond an empirical comparison, we also give theoretical justifications on their implicit assumptions. To our knowledge, these assumptions have never been made explicit or they are `lost' in the large volume of the related literature. Based on the gained insights, we propose three alternative linear normalization methods.",1,ad,True
"In the experiments we use the gov2.1000 and gov2.30 splits of the TREC GOV2 dataset [2]. In gov2.1000 the largest 1000 hosts of the GOV2 dataset are treated as 1000 sources, and the number of sources that contain relevant documents is usually much less than 1000. In gov2.30 the collections of gov2.1000 are clustered into 30 sources; here, relevant documents appear in most of the sources. We use ten retrieval functions implemented by the Terrier toolkit 1, namely, BM25, tf-idf (Terrier and Lemur versions), language modeling (original and with Dirichlet smoothing), and a number of DFRbased functions (BM25, BB2, IFB2, InL2 and PL2). Retrieval functions are randomly assigned to sources. Topics 701-850 are used as queries. Operationally, engines return truncated rankings for efficiency reasons, thus, we only consider either the top 10 or 1000 results. Our results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, which we will refer to throughout the paper.

2. LINEAR SCORE NORMALIZATION,0,,False
"The MinMax method [3] scales the output score range per engine to [0, 1]. We argue that the most important assumption behind MinMax is that each source contains at least 1 relevant document, and that this document will mostlikely get ranked 1st. By assigning the same highest score to all 1st documents, they are ranked before any other in the merged list. Since it is also assumed that these documents are most-likely relevant, a high early precision is achieved which pushes higher other evaluation measures sensitive to early rank positions, e.g. MAP. Thus, MinMax owes its success to getting right the early ranks in the merged list. However, due to fact that the 1st document of each engine is assigned the same highest score, MinMax produces a roundrobin effect in merging which may impact effectiveness neg-",1,MAP,True

"atively as the number of engines increases. Indeed, MinMax shows high performance when run on 30 sources that contain sufficient relevant documents, i.e. the above assumption is satisfied. On the contrary, when run on 1000 sources, where the assumption is weakened by the sparseness of relevant documents and additionally the round-robin effect is more prominent, MinMax performance degrades considerably.",1,ad,True
"The Sum method [5] is similar to MinMax, but without using a fixed highest score eliminating the undesirable round-robin effect: the minimum score is shifted to 0 while the sum of all scores per ranked-list is scaled to 1: s ,"" s-min, snorm "","" s / i si. The intuition given in [4] is: under the assumption of exponentially-distributed scores, the normalization is equivalent to setting the means of score distributions of sources to be equal to each other. However, many studies on modeling scores show that the aforementioned assumption of exponentially-distributed scores does not hold in practice, especially for top-ranked documents. Our experimental results show that the Sum method almost always has the worst performance. This contradicts the results of the original work [5], however, the authors in the last-mentioned study used a meta-search setup and evaluated normalization and combination methods together--a setup that does not isolate the normalization problem.""",1,ad,True
"In [5] also the Z-Score method is proposed, which normalizes each score to its number of standard deviations that it is away from the mean score. However, as previously noted in [1], this method rather assumes a bell-like distribution of document scores (e.g. a Normal), where the mean would be a meaningful `neutral' score. However, in practice score distributions are highly skewed and clearly violate this assumption. Still if only the top documents are considered from each result list, they are likely to be relevant, and therefore the distribution of their scores may be close to that of relevant documents, i.e. likely a Normal. Indeed, our results show that when only the top-10 documents are retrieved from each source, Z-Score usually shows higher performance than when applied on the top-1000 documents.",0,,False
"So far we have seen that methods that assume particular score distribution shapes, such as Sum and Z-Score, are worse, and that MinMax which does not make such assumptions is better. In other words, the sum or the mean of scores do not seem to be a good statistics for normalization, and that we should be looking into the direction of MinMax for developing a better normalization. We also know that using a fixed highest score should be preferably avoided so as to eliminate the round-robin effect, as well as, to be able to down-weigh sources of no relevance (haunting the main assumption of MinMax). Another problem rarely mentioned that all three methods above have is that they are greatly affected by the minimum score seen, or else, the chosen truncation point of the rankings (e.g. the minimum score of top-10 documents is usually very different from the minimum score of top-1000).",0,,False
"We will first try to deal with the minimum-score problem. The lowest theoretical score of many scoring functions is 0. Thus, making the assumption that the most non-relevant documents usually score at 0, the minimum in MinMax function should also be set to 0. This way we obtain the Max method: snorm ,"" s/max. Our results show that Max, although simpler, almost always has the same or higher performance than that of the MinMax method.""",0,,False

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Recently, researchers have shown interest in the use of preference judgments for evaluation in IR literature. Although preference judgments have several advantages over absolute judgment, one of the major disadvantages is that the number of judgments needed increases polynomially as the number of documents in the pool increases. We propose a novel method using PageRank to minimize the number of judgments required to evaluate systems using preference judgments. We test the proposed hypotheses using the TREC 2004 to 2006 Terabyte dataset to show that it is possible to reduce the evaluation cost considerably. Further, we study the susceptibility of the methods due to assessor errors.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"The idea of pairwise preference judgments is relatively new in IR literature. In the case of preference judgments, an assessor looks at a pair of documents and expresses a preference for one over the other instead of assigning a relevance label to a document. Comparison studies between absolute and preference judgments show that preference judgments have various advantages such as reducing the complexity of the task and increasing inter-assessor agreement [3]. Preference judgments tend to help assessors make finer distinctions between documents [5]. Although it is possible to use graded absolute judgments, it is difficult to determine the specifics of the grades, and the burden on assessors is likely to increase with an increase in the number of grades.",1,ad,True
"A major drawback of using pairwise preference judgments is that as the number of documents in the pool increases, the number of judgments increases polynomially. If there are n documents in the pool, then n(n-1)/2 preference judgments would be necessary to ensure that all pairs of documents are judged. This enormous increase in the number of pairwise judgments not only increases evaluation cost but also gives rise to user fatigue and boredom, possibly leading to poor quality of judgments.",1,ad,True

"In this work, we describe a novel technique that could be used to reduce the number of pairwise judgments. Firstly, we show that pairwise judgments for each query can be represented in the form of a directed graph on which various graph algorithms can be applied. We study the behavior of PageRank and show that the number of pairwise judgments could be reduced considerably. Further, we show that the PageRank method, although susceptible to assessor error, does significantly better than the majority vote approach that is considered as the baseline.",0,,False
2. PREFERENCE FRAMEWORK,0,,False
"In this section we describe a novel technique to collect preference judgments at a reduced cost. The technique consists of two steps: graphical representation of pairwise judgments and scoring of each node in the graph. Scoring of nodes can be done using various graph algorithms such as PageRank, HITS, etc.",0,,False
"We describe a typical user interface for collecting preference judgments as follows: the assessor would be shown two documents and a statement of an information need (a topic); the assessor would have to pick the most preferred document using the prefer left or prefer right buttons. Additionally, both documents could be judged not relevant to indicate that all other documents should be preferred to them. The criteria for preference is task dependent and is often explained to the assessor in the form of guidelines.",0,,False
"The collected pairwise judgments are then represented in the form of a directed graph. Each unique document is represented as a vertex in the graph and the edges between vertices corresponds to the pairwise judgments. While there are several ways to do this conversion, we describe a way which worked for us. Let's say there are three judgments a user can make for a pair of documents (DocA, DocB): prefer DocA, both non relevant, and prefer DocB. When prefer DocA is selected for a pair, this translates to a directed link from DocB to DocA, similarly a link from DocA to DocB when DocB is preferred and there exists no link between DocA and DocB in the case of both non relevant.",0,,False
"Now that the pairwise judgments have been represented in the form of a graph, there are several graph algorithms such as PageRank, HITS, etc. that could be used to assign a score. The score represents the relevance of a document and documents are ranked based on these scores. In this work we compare the performance of PageRank with the a baseline majority vote method.",0,,False
1167,0,,False
"PageRank The PageRank algorithm proposed by Brin and Page [2] is a graph algorithm that assigns a numerical weighting to each vertex in a graph, with the purpose of measuring its relative importance within the graph. We compute the page rank scores for each node in the preference graph and hypothesize that the page rank scores correlate to the degree of relevance of the document. Majority Vote A common technique used to produce a ranking from pairwise judgments is to sort documents by the number of times the document was preferred. The count of the number of preferences can be obtained from the preference graph by computing the in-degree for each node. We use this method as our baseline.",0,,False
"Both algorithms produce the same ranking when all pairwise judgments are used, i.e. if n(n - 1)/2 pairwise judgments are used to judge n documents. But their behavior changes if some pairwise judgments are removed from the sample of n(n - 1)/2 pairwise judgments. In order to study this behavior, we simulate preference judgments from graded judgments and evaluate the performance of rankings produced by randomly sampling 1%, 5%, 10%, ..., 100% of n(n - 1)/2 pairwise judgments. We use the nDCG measure proposed by Jarvelin and Kekalainen [4] to evaluate the performance of each ranking against original graded judgments.",1,ad,True
3. IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS,0,,False
"Our experiments are conducted on data simulated using the TREC 2004 to 2006 Terabyte dataset. The TREC Terabyte consists of a total of 150 topics with relevance graded judgments on a three-point scale. The corpus is a collection of Web data crawled from websites in the GOV domain during early 2004. The absolute graded judgments are converted to preference judgments by generating all possible pairs for the documents in the qrels file for each topic; the document with a higher grade is preferred in each pair. Aslam et al. [1] presented a meta-search approach known as meta-AP which is a function of the document's position in a set of ranked lists, with higher rankings contributing more to the metaAP score. We employ metaAP scores to resolve ties when the grades of both the documents in a pair are equal (document with higher meta score is chosen). Document pairs containing two non-relevant documents are considered as both non-relevant (no link in preference graph).",1,TREC,True
"Figure 1 shows the nDCG scores at rank 20 and 1000 for the PageRank method compared with the majority votes method. The figure includes a run each for various sample sizes of the pairwise judgments and three Down Sample runs represented as DS. The Down Samples were generated by pairing each document in the pool of n documents with another document k times, i.e. each document in the pool of n documents is paired with another document for DS1 and two other documents for DS2 and so on. Note that there would be n pairwise judgments in DS1 and 2n pairwise judgments in DS2. The nDCG computed from PageRank-based judgments is much higher than that computed from majority vote. Clearly, the PageRank method requires fewer number of pairs of judgments compared to the majority votes method on average and the results suggest that it is possible to collect preference judgments by judging just 5% of the pairs with minimal loss of performance.",0,,False

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Federated search is the task of retrieving documents from multiple (possibly non-overlapping) collections in response to a query [1].

We focus on the resultsmerging step; specifically, we study the merits of using information induced from inter-document similarities.",0,,False
"While there is much work on utilizing inter-document similarities for the single-corpus retrieval setting, there is little work along that venue for federated retrieval. For example, clustering was used to transform a single-collection retrieval setting into that of multiple collections [8]. Clusters of sampled documents were used for performing query expansion in federated search [5]; yet, inter-document similarities were not used for results merging. Furthermore, it was shown that among the clusters created across the lists retrieved from different collections there are some that contain a high percentage of relevant documents [3]; still, a results merging method exploiting these clusters was not proposed",0,,False

The adapted method that we study integrates retrieval scores assigned by a state-ofthe-art results-merging approach (e.g., CORI [1] and SSL [7]) with information induced from clusters created from similar documents across the retrieved lists. Specifically, a document can provide relevance-status support to documents in the same list or in other lists that it is similar to.

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Personalization of search results offers the potential for significant improvement in information retrieval performance. User interactions with the system and documents during informationseeking sessions provide a wealth of information about user preferences and their task goals. In this paper, we propose methods for analyzing and modeling user search behavior in search sessions to predict document usefulness and then using information to personalize search results. We generate prediction models of document usefulness from behavior data collected in a controlled lab experiment with 32 participants, each completing uncontrolled searching for 4 tasks in the Web. The generated models are then tested with another data set of user search sessions in radically different search tasks and constrains. The documents predicted useful and not useful by the models are used to modify the queries in each search session using a standard relevance feedback technique. The results show that application of the models led to consistently improved performance over a baseline that did not take account of user interaction information. These findings have implications for designing systems for personalized search and improving user search experience.",1,ad,True

"their behaviors during the search session. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of using the observation of people's behaviors during information-seeking sessions for improving and personalizing their interactions with information. We generated document usefulness prediction models from a laboratory experiment of the influence of different types of tasks on task search session behaviors, including a general model and several specific models tailored to different types of tasks. Then these prediction models were applied to TREC 2011 Session Track data to evaluate their retrieval performance.",1,TREC,True
"Our study makes several contributions to the literature. First, we examined user behavioral measures as predictors of document usefulness and built prediction models. Second, we demonstrate the prediction models perform well on an entirely different dataset of user interactions. Third, we found that the prediction accuracy of document usefulness and some of users' search behaviors are positively related to the consistent increase in retrieval performance by the personalization model.",0,,False
2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
2.1 Sources for Implicit Relevance Feedback,0,,False
"Users of information retrieval systems can provide explicit information about their interests and task intent via relevance feedback. However, users may not be willing to provide explicit relevance feedback, so research has concentrated on techniques to gain relevance feedback information via implicit processes. These implicit relevance feedback (IRF) techniques observe user search behaviors unobtrusively and infer the relevance/usefulness of documents and other information objects from the user interactions. Evidence for IRF comes from various measures of user search behaviors while interacting with individual content pages, search result pages, and other behaviors during a search session [11] [9].",0,,False
"Document usefulness for IRF may be learned from behaviors such as dwell time on each content page, the number of clicks and scrolling on each content page, number of visits to each content page, and further usage of content pages [9]. User behaviors on search result pages have been found to be good indicators of user document preferences [9]. These behaviors include the time on a search result page before the first click, total time on a search result page, click-through and click order of each content page on the search result page, and so on [1] [7]. There is also evidence that the nature of query reformulation during a search episode can be predictive of document usefulness, and perhaps of task type [13]. In the research to date, these sources for IRF have typically been investigated individually, with little work integrating multiple user behaviors over all types of Web pages to predict document usefulness.",0,,False

2.2 Implicit Relevance Feedback,0,,False
"Correlation of individual measures of user behavior with users' document preferences have been found to vary for different task types [10] [16] and in different search stages [14]. White and Kelly [16] analyzed retrieval performance after implementing an IRF system based on dwell time on content pages when task type information was considered and when the user information was considered. They found that dwell time combined with knowledge of task information improved retrieval performance. White, Ruthven and Jose [18] examined the effect of search stages on the utility of implicit relevance feedback (IRF) and explicit relevance feedback (ERF) in two separate systems. Their results showed that in the IRF system, IRF is used more in the middle of the search than at the beginning or end, whereas in ERF system, ERF is used more towards the end. Liu and Belkin [14] examined the interaction between decision time on content pages, search stage, and document usefulness, and found knowledge of search stage could help improve the interpretation of decision time as IRF, as could knowledge of task and topic. This work suggests that a high performance search personalization model should predict document usefulness taking account of the users' search context, including task type, user task and topic knowledge, search stage, and so on. Generally, the performance of a personalization algorithm should be improved if it incorporates the ability to predict aspects of the user's task and knowledge.",1,corpora,True

4.1 Building the Models,0,,False
"We used binary recursive partitioning analysis [5] to identify the most important predictors of useful pages. Recursive partitioning is a stochastic learning technique for non-parametric classification problems. It grows decision trees by examining all independent variables and splits a node using the variable that best distinguishes the remaining data in the collection. The tree is grown until all of the data has been assigned to a node. Recursive partitioning has an intuitive interpretation as a collection of rules to classify the dataset. An example (illustrative only) might be ""The document is useful if dwell time > 20 seconds and the time to the first click < 34 seconds and there are fewer than 5 SERPs in the query interval"". This method has not been used much in identifying predictors of document usefulness or user interests.",0,,False
207,0,,False
Recursive partitioning may be superior to logistic regression when the goal is to correctly classify members rather than optimize overall accuracy. Recursive partitioning can take account of the possible interactions between predictor variables natively in the algorithm.,0,,False
"We used recursive partitioning analysis to generate prediction models of document usefulness based on the potentially important behavioral variables listed in Table 2. Decision trees were generated using these predictors, and we identified the cutoff points based on the observed distribution of the variables in the dataset. To better learn the behavioral measures, we made a training collection that balanced the number of saved pages and not-saved pages by sampling the larger not-saved pages pool. In this way, ten balanced training sets were constructed, each sharing the same saved pages pool. The recursive partitioning method was applied to each sample to generate the prediction model. We then compared the variables and cutoff values in these generated models to identify the repeated variables and cutoff values for the decision-tree based prediction model.",1,ad,True
4.2 General Prediction Models,0,,False
"We first built the general prediction model when considering all tasks in the experiment, without taking account of the task type. In this model, three behavioral measures were identified as the important factors: visit_id, dwell time and time to first click.",0,,False
"with the total number of saved pages, and then generated the prediction models using recursive partitioning. Because the CPE task and OBI task in our user experiment differ the most from one another as task types, we present the specific prediction models for CPE (Figure 2) and OBI (Figure 3).",0,,False
"These tree models show that dwell time on documents is still the most important predictor. However, the cutoff point for each task is very different, i.e. 30.65 seconds in CPE and 17.5 seconds in OBI. This result indicates that appropriate cutoff points are needed for different types of tasks, as White and Kelly [16] suggested. As for the general model, we suggest the median as the cutoff point for each task. The CPE model also identifies visit time of the page, number of mouse clicks on the page, and the proportion of time spent on content pages during the query interval (prop_content) as important variables. Among them, the number of mouse clicks was negatively related to the saved documents, and the prop_content was positively related to the saved documents. The OBI model looks very similar to the general model, except that it specifies a range for the variable time to first click, which is close to the first quarter to the median value for that variable in the dataset.",0,,False
Figure 1 General prediction model,0,,False
"Among these three variables, the dwell time on documents is the most important variable in the general prediction model. Examining the distribution of dwell time in the dataset, we found that the model cutoff (17.45 seconds) is the third quarter of the dwell time in all the data. At the same time, we found users saved one quarter of all the visited pages in the assigned task, so it is reasonable to infer that the cutoff point for the dwell time variable depends upon the proportion of saved documents among all visited documents. If the relative frequency of saved documents is not clear in a new dataset, the median dwell time can be adopted as used in White and Kelly [17]. Not many documents were visited more than once by users in one search session, so the model specifies that if a page has been visited more than once, even though the dwell time is shorter than the median, the page is predicted to be useful. Finally, the cutoff time for time to first click is close to the first quarter of the distribution in the dataset. We will apply these cutoff points in our test dataset to evaluate the prediction model.",1,ad,True

There are very few examples of three other types of tasks (i.e. SSU, DSN, DAN) in the data set. When we tried to match these task types with the task classification in our user experiment (Table 1), we found that the SSN type of task was mostly similar to CPE, and DSN and DAN types of tasks were very similar to OBI, so we used these specific models for those tasks.

Specifically, we look at the behaviors in sessions where our models improved retrieval performance by greater than 0.20 on ERR and for sessions where the models did worse than-0.05 on ERR. We compare the behavioral variables in the search sessions between the two extremes in retrieval performance defined by the GP model in Table 11.

"In this study, we generated document usefulness prediction models based on a laboratory experiment of the influence of different types of tasks on task session behaviors. We constructed a general prediction model and several specific prediction models tailored to different types of tasks. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to generate decision tree models based on users' interaction behaviors during search sessions. Our models identified three main behavioral measures as important predictors of document usefulness: dwell time on document, the number of times a page has been visited in the session (visit_id), and the time before first click after issuing a query (time to first click). Besides the positive relationship between dwell time and document usefulness, we found that, in all but one case, the visit_id and time_to_first_click to be positively related to document usefulness. The specific models for different types of tasks show major differences by task type for both the predictors and the rules. For example, in the specific prediction model for CPE, number of mouse clicks on the document was negatively related to document usefulness, and the proportion of time spent on content pages during query interval (prop_content) was positively related to document usefulness. However, neither of these two measures and associated rules was useful in the specific model for OBI. Furthermore, although all models included dwell time as a significant factor, cut-off points for dwell time to predict usefulness differed between the different tasks, and from that of the general model.",0,,False
"A primary focus of this study was to evaluate whether the prediction models generated from our user experiment could improve retrieval performance, so we applied our models to the TREC 2011 Session Track data. The comparison of the prediction by the different models against TREC assessors' relevance judgments showed the general model had higher accuracy than the specific models. One reason for this is that there is a great imbalance in task type in the TREC 2011 Session Track data. The vast majority of the tasks were of a task type similar to the CPE task in our experiment. Our specific model for CPE contains number of mouse clicks on the documents as one of the predictors, but such data was not available in the server-side logs in the TREC 2011 Session Track. The task type imbalance also meant that not enough data was available (10 sessions in total) for three of the four types of tasks (SSU, DSN, DAN). Consequently, one can expect the specific models will fail when they try to adapt to the individual task types. In addition, other facets of the task types may present in the TREC Session Track that differ from those in the user experiment in our lab. Such facets could influence users' behaviors in different ways. For example, users were given 20 minutes for searching in our experiment, whereas in the crowdsourced search sessions in the TREC Session Track, users were given only 5 minutes for searching. Users were likely to have searched with an awareness of time-pressure which might not have been the case during our experiment.",1,TREC,True
"With respect to retrieval performance, all of our models improved a great deal from the baseline which used pseudo relevance feedback on the last queries users issued in each session. Our general model had somewhat better retrieval performance than the specific model on both of the two relevance feedback methods. The models with positive relevance feedback performed only slightly better than the models with both positive and negative relevance feedback. This suggests that using negative IRF may not be worth the effort, although perhaps the limited size of the data set for the TREC Session Track mitigates this conclusion. In addition, we found that the better the prediction accuracy of",1,ad,True
"document usefulness, the more likely that the model could improve retrieval performance.",0,,False
"Teevan, Dumais & Horvitz [16] examined users' clicks and explicit judgments for the same queries and found they differed greatly from one another. They proposed that the potential for personalization could be defined by the gap between how well search engines could perform if they were to tailor results to the individual, and how well they currently perform by returning results designed to satisfy everyone. In our study, we also addressed the question of when to apply personalization models by presenting the retrieval difference between our models and the baseline. We found our prediction models consistently improved retrieval performance over the baseline in some sessions, but consistently decreased the performance of the baseline line in some other sessions. We compared some users' behavioral measures during these sessions, and found significant differences between the two extreme groups. In particular, users spent significantly more dwell time on each content page and a greater proportion of task time on content pages for the sessions where the personalization models we applied were beneficial. Dwell time on content pages has been proven to be positively related to document relevance, and one explanation for our results is that users were visiting more useful documents in the sessions where the models performed well and that query expansion based on the useful documents helped users to articulate their information needs. Therefore, IRF based on the predicted useful documents achieved better results than using the top n returned documents, as in pseudo relevance feedback. Further work is needed to investigate when the system should apply personalization models to improve retrieval performance.",1,ad,True
"Because the data that we used for our personalization models should be applicable to any general retrieval system, one might expect that our levels of improvement would be applicable to techniques with much higher baseline performance, resulting in higher absolute performance levels. It is also the case that our usefulness prediction models were used as input to quite standard, and rather simple relevance feedback techniques. More sophisticated use of the models could result in better overall performance improvement.",0,,False
8. CONCLUSION,0,,False
"In this study, we used searchers' interaction behavioral measures derived from a laboratory experiment to build prediction models of document usefulness. We then evaluated the prediction accuracy and retrieval performance of these models by applying them to the TREC 2011 Session Track data set, where users search interactions were generated in radically different search sessions. We found several behavioral measures, e.g. dwell time, visit time, time to first click, proportion of time on content pages, and others could be potential predictors of document usefulness. We also found different combinations of variables and rules of prediction models based on these measures for different types of tasks. The results demonstrate that the prediction models we generated from our user experiment improve the performance over a baseline that did not take account of user interaction information in search sessions with quite different characteristics than those from which the prediction models were developed. The positive ""transfer"" effect leads us to believe the models we have developed may be used for personalization of retrieval in a variety of searching circumstances, and that we could expect even greater performance benefit when richer, client-side data that our prediction models depend upon are applied.",1,TREC,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Although a great deal of research has been conducted about automatic techniques for determining query quality, there have been relatively few studies about how people judge query quality. This study investigated this topic through a laboratory experiment with 40 subjects. Subjects were shown eight information problems (five fact-finding and three exploratory) and asked to evaluate queries for these problems according to several quality attributes. Subjects then evaluated search engine results pages (SERPs) for each query, which were manipulated to exhibit different levels of performance. Following this, subjects reevaluated the queries, were interviewed about their evaluation approaches and repeated the rating procedure for two information problems. Results showed that for fact-finding information problems, longer queries received higher ratings (both initial and post-SERP), and that post-SERP query ratings were more affected by the proportion of relevant documents viewed to all documents viewed rather than the ranks of the relevant documents. For exploratory information problems, subjects' ratings were highly correlated with the number of relevant documents in the SERP as well as the proportion of relevant documents viewed. Subjects adopted several approaches when evaluating query quality, which led to different quality ratings. Finally, during the reliability check subjects' initial evaluations were fairly stable, but their post-SERP evaluations significantly increased.",1,ad,True

"Query performance prediction (QPP) is the task of estimating the expected quality of search results for a query in the absence of relevance feedback [4, 8]. The basic goal is to predict when a query will perform poorly so that some intervention can occur before results are returned. For example, additional information",1,Query,True

"might be elicited from the user or term expansion might be used to enhance the query. QPP approaches are classified into two types: pre-retrieval and post-retrieval [4, 8]. Pre-retrieval approaches estimate query performance based on features of the query while post-retrieval approaches consider the results retrieved by the query. Pre-retrieval approaches are further subdivided into those that exploit the linguistic structure of the query, including the morphological, syntactical and semantic properties of the query, and those that use term statistics, including specificity, similarity, coherency and relatedness. Post-retrieval approaches include measures such as clarity and robustness, and score analysis.",0,,False
"Although a great deal of research has been conducted about QPP, there have been relatively few studies about the relationship among QPPs and users' evaluations of query difficulty. Hauff et al. [10] note ""while most QPP methods have been motivated and developed based on how a user might rate a query, these intuitions have never been empirically validated"" (pg. 980). To address this limitation, Hauff et al. [9, 10] compared the query performance ratings made by humans with performance scores estimated by a suite of QPP methods. Results showed that user ratings and QPPs were mostly uncorrelated, suggesting that QPP methods are not representative of how users evaluate query quality. Lioma et al. [12] found that users could not reliably identify pre-determined query difficulty ratings associated with a set of 420 queries, but were able to identify some features that would make a query difficult for a search system.",1,ad,True
"While these previous studies provide some insight about the relationship among QPPs and users' evaluations of query difficulty, they do not reveal insight about how people actually judge query quality. In one of the studies reported by Hauff et al. [10], assessors were provided with queries and information need descriptions and asked to judge the queries based on what they expected the results to be if they submitted the queries to a Web search engine. Assessors made their judgments using a 5-point scale, where 1,poor quality query and 5,""high quality query. The researchers did not report assessors' experiences using this scale to evaluate query quality, although it was noted that their ratings varied considerably. Lioma et al. [12] asked assessors to rate queries using three categories (easy, medium, hard). In both studies, assessors evaluated queries without inspecting results. Neither study probed people about how they judged query quality.""",1,ad,True
"People rate a variety of objects in daily life (e.g., movies, restaurants, books), but it is unlikely that many people have rated queries. How would people approach this task? What factors would they consider when evaluating query quality? How would they make decisions about which numeric ratings to assign to which queries? In this paper we explore these questions. We are not concerned with the relationship between QPPs and people's evaluations of query quality, but instead seek to address more fundamental questions about how people make evaluations of query quality. Specifically, our research questions are (RQ1)",1,ad,True
215,0,,False
"How do people make judgments about query quality? (RQ2) How are people's judgments related to features of the query, information problem and search results? (RQ3) How reliable are people's judgments?",0,,False
"Understanding how people evaluate query quality is important for several reasons. A better understanding of how people evaluate query quality might provide data on which to model future QPPs, or it might help researchers better understand the differences between automatic QPPs and human QPP. Although QPPs leverage collection-based statistics and should not necessarily be correlated with users' query evaluations, understanding how people view query quality might be helpful in modeling computer-human interaction regarding QPP. Understanding how people evaluate query quality is also important in the context of another popular IR technique: query suggestion. Traditionally, query suggestions are presented to users without any information about their potential goodness or quality. However, it might be useful to allow users to provide query recommendations to others, that is, query suggestions that have rating information associated with them in a manner similar to that provided by recommendation services such as Amazon and Netflix. It might also be useful for an information system to elicit query ratings from users so that it can make more personalized recommendations in the future. While suggestion and recommendation are often used as synonyms in the literature, in this study we distinguish between these two terms to demarcate a difference between the provision of unrated and rated suggestions, respectively. We pose one additional question to better understand what people think of the idea of query recommendation: (RQ4) What are people's perceptions of query recommendations? This is a natural question to ask in the context of an experiment that focuses on how people evaluate query quality, since this would presumably underlie query recommendation.",1,ad,True
2. BACKGROUND,0,,False
"This study is related to three major areas of research: query performance predictors (QPPs), query suggestion, and online recommendations. Because this paper is not focused on automatic QPPs, this research is not reviewed (see [4] for an overview).",0,,False
"In a series of studies, Hauff and colleagues [9, 10] explored the relationship between QPPs and users' evaluations of query quality. This work was motivated by the observation that underlying most QPP methods are assumptions about how users evaluate query quality, despite a lack of research about how users make decisions about queries and suggestions. In a series of studies, Hauff and colleagues found few strong correlations between assessors' query quality evaluations and QPPs. The researchers first collected pre-retrieval ratings from 18 assessors for a set of 50 topics. Assessors were shown information need descriptions and queries and asked to indicate their expectations of the quality of the search results.",0,,False
"Hauff et al. [9, 10] found great variability is assessors' query ratings, and few direct correlations between these ratings and a set of QPP pre-retrieval measures. Hauff et al. also compared preretrieval and post-retrieval QPP measures with assessors' pre- and post-retrieval query quality ratings of a set of query suggestions. While assessors could distinguish between high and low quality suggestions, their ratings were uncorrelated with the automatic QPP measures. Across all experiments, the QPP measure that was most correlated with assessors' ratings was the pre-retrieval predictor SumSCQ which assigns higher quality scores to more specific queries. Typically queries that contain more terms are",0,,False
"associated with a higher SumSCQ; this suggests that people's preretrieval query quality judgments might be influenced by query length. Similarly, Lioma et al [12] found that people were fairly good at identifying features that were correlated with query difficulty, including queries that were ""too vague"" or ""too short,"" but were unable to reliably assess query difficulty using a rating scale of easy, medium and hard.",0,,False
"In addition to these studies, two studies have examined the relationship between QPPs and user performance [18, 19]. While these studies focused on different research questions than the ones on which we focus, their results showed that user performance was unrelated to several QPP measures. Turpin and Hersh [18] found that the clarity scores of queries created by their users were much lower on average than those reported in system-based QPP evaluations where queries were automatically created. Turpin and Hersh further found that there was no correlation between the clarity of a user's query (a post-retrieval QPP) and the user's actual performance on the search task. Zhao and Scholer [19] examined nine pre-retrieval QPPs and found that they were not useful predictors of when users experienced search difficulties.",1,ad,True
"A portion of Hauff et al.'s [10] work was a secondary analysis of data collected in a study investigating the extent to which users could be induced to take bad query suggestions because they believed many others had taken the suggestions [11]. Kelly et al. [11] did not find an effect for ""query popularity,"" but did find that users selected significantly more high quality than low quality query suggestions. Although this research was not conducted in the context of QPP, it does provide some indirect evidence that people make predictive judgments about query quality when selecting among a set of suggestions and that these judgments are often accurate. Like QPP research, query suggestion research is an area that might benefit from an increased understanding of how people evaluate query quality.",1,ad,True
"Increasing amounts of research have been published about query suggestion within the last ten years [15] and query suggestion is now a common feature of many information search systems. When users issue queries to most major commercial search services, they receive search results and query suggestions. However, they do not receive information about how the query suggestions were selected. While these query suggestions are likely identified through a combination of techniques based on aggregated query log data, details about the usage and frequency of various queries are not displayed to users. In social and collaborative search systems, query suggestions come from fellow users who belong to a community or specialized group with a common set of information needs [1, 16, 17]. These suggestions are also free-standing in the sense that users only know that they have been suggested or used, but nothing about their potential quality or usefulness. Thus, it seems that an important opportunity might exist in allowing users to associate ratings with query suggestions. In recent work, Baraglia et al. [2] proposed the idea of machine-rated query suggestions where queries would be rated with a 10-point scale (10,""positive, 5"",neutral and 1,""negative), but their research was focused on algorithms for selecting and rating suggestions, rather than user ratings or interpretations of ratings.""",0,,False
"In this paper we distinguish between query suggestions and query recommendations. The key difference between the two is the presence (recommendation) or absence (suggestion) of rating information. While suggestions can be generated by both systems and humans, ratings are, in most cases, associated with humans. The basic act of associating ratings with items is one with which most people are familiar. However, rating behavior, in general, is",0,,False
216,0,,False
"not a well-understood topic, even in the recommender system literature [7]. A recent call for a special issue of ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS) states that little research has focused on the decision-making processes of users. Instead, research has focused on algorithms for identifying recommendations and eliciting and modeling users' preferences1.",1,ad,True
"Rating behavior has been studied more extensively in the consumer behavior literature. This research has primarily focused on consumer bias, cultural differences, brand loyalty and receiver experience and expertise in relation to commercial products [c.f., 6, 14]. A typical way these studies conceptualize objects that are rated, and people's subsequent use of ratings for making decisions about these objects, is by classifying them into search and experience goods [13]. Search goods are goods that are characterized by product attributes for which full information can be acquired before purchase. Search goods (e.g., dishwasher) are typically evaluated using objective criteria (e.g., capacity, noise level). Institutional-based ratings (e.g., Consumer Reports) often guide purchasing behavior. Experience goods (e.g., wine, movies, and books) are goods whose ratings are dominated by subjective attributes. For these types of goods, user ratings (instead of institutional ratings) often guide purchasing behavior.",1,ad,True
"We submit that query recommendations have more in common with experience goods. As with most experience goods, users need to experience the item before rating it; we are not suggesting that people blindly rate other people's queries, but rather rate their own queries after they have finished searching. It is an open question as to how people would approach this task and if they would even find recommendations useful. Furthermore, previous research has found the stability of people's ratings of experience goods somewhat brittle and influenced by the ratings of others [20]; thus, another open question concerns the stability of people's ratings.",0,,False

"A laboratory experiment was conducted using a classic pretest/post-test design. The pre-test allowed us to observe how subjects would rate query quality before viewing search results (pre-retrieval), while the post-test allowed us to observe if and how these evaluations changed as a result of viewing search results (post-retrieval). We manipulated search result quality to determine if specific performance levels could be mapped to specific query quality scores.",0,,False
"Subjects were instructed that they would be shown other people's information problems and queries and then provide evaluations of query quality. Subjects completed three major steps: (1) initial query evaluation where they were shown an information problem description and query and asked to evaluate the query according to several attributes; (2) search result evaluation where they were shown a list of 10 search results and asked to evaluate these results; and (3) post-SERP query evaluation where they were once again presented with the information problem description and query and asked to re-evaluate the query. These steps were completed for eight information problems. After the evaluation, subjects were interviewed about the strategies they used to evaluate queries and their opinions about the usefulness of query recommendations.

Figure 4 shows the percentage of times subjects' explicit relevance judgments corresponded with the judgments made by the researchers and the click rate for each information problem. Click rate is defined as the percentage of web results clicked from a ten-result SERP.

FF3 also received the highest click rate among a range of click rates from 0.40 to 0.57.

Despite the disagreement between EP and IP for EX information problems, subjects experienced the intended relative performance conditions except for EX3. For this topic, there were 6 relevant documents in the list and for the high condition this meant that most of these were concentrated near the top of the list. It is likely that subjects stopped reviewing the list once they found a few relevant documents, which would lead to lower EP nDCG scores for high performance conditions.

Subjects using the Selective approach only examined one search result, while those using an Exhaustive approach examined all ten search results. For EX information problems subjects took more varied approaches resulting in three groups: Selective, Persistent and Exhaustive. The Selective approach represented cases where subjects examined 1-3 results, the Persistent, 4 to 7 results, and the Exhaustive, 8 to 10 results.

"In addition to examining subjects' evaluation behaviors, we asked subjects during the exit interview how they initially evaluated queries and then re-evaluated them after viewing search results (RQ1).

"compared queries to what they would put in a search box; if they could think of better expressions they would rate the queries worse, and vice versa. Subjects took more varied approaches to assigning post-SERP ratings. Some mentioned they based their ratings on the number of relevant results they had found, some relied on the positions of relevant search results, and others considered both factors. Yet rarely did subjects differentiate between approaches taken to evaluate queries for FF and EX information problems. Although some indicated they spent more time on EX information problems because they wished to gather more background information on the topic, many of them said that for FF problems they kept looking for other search results even when they had successfully identified the answer. The motivation for the latter came from the fear that they could miss something, the answer could be wrong, they had personal interests in some topics, or simply out of habit.",1,ad,True
"We also asked subjects how they felt about using star-ratings during real-world searching (RQ4). When asked whether they would consider using a system which provides rated query suggestions, many said yes because it would save time and benefit people who are not experienced with searching. Some said it depended on who rated the query suggestions and how well they could formulate queries by themselves. People who said they would not use such systems expressed doubt because systems or other people could not predict their information needs, or even if they could some subjects believed star-ratings were very subjective and they would rather have descriptions about why a query could be useful. Subjects constantly associated query starratings with hotel and restaurant stars and other product reviews and ratings such as those that appear in Netflix and Amazon. Their familiarity with these common usages resulted in a general agreement on the concept: the more stars there were, the higher the quality. The majority of the subjects believed 5-star query suggestions would lead to the most relevant results, some mentioned that they would expect these queries to also help them find information the quickest. Subjects said they would interpret 3-star queries as those that lead to information that was buried in the search results and would take some time to discover.

"Our study conceptualized query evaluation as a two-stage process: initial evaluation and post-SERP evaluation, a distinction drawn from pre-retrieval and post-retrieval QPP approaches. Queries were first assessed based on impressions of query strings, and further refined after SERPs were examined. We found that by first impression, longer queries led to higher query quality for FF information problems; this was supported by the concept of ""specificity"" solicited from subjects during the interviews. This result also aligns with Hauff et al. [10] who found that assessors' query quality ratings were moderately correlated with the preretrieval predictor SumSCQ which assigns higher quality scores to more specific queries and with Lioma et al. [12] whose subjects identified vague and short queries as problematic for systems.",0,,False
We found that subjects rated queries associated with EX information problems higher in quality compared with FF queries of the same length. Subjects' post-SERP evaluations of queries for EX information problems were also higher than for FF problems. These results might be explained by the vagueness of EX information problems as mentioned by subjects; subjects probably did not pose as strict evaluation standards on open information needs than on more defined information needs. It is also likely that subjects viewed themselves as more open to ideas when searching for EX information problems. This suggests that perhaps query recommendations would have the greatest potential for these types of information problems.,0,,False
"When examining how result quality affected query quality, it appeared that interactive precision, the number of relevant search results found to the number of documents viewed was the best predictor of post-SERP ratings of query quality for both types of information problems. This is in contrast with what we expected, which is that reciprocal rank would be a better predictor of subjects' post-SERP evaluations of query quality for FF information problems. Rather, our finding implies that regardless of information problem type, people expected that a good quality query would retrieve more than one relevant result.",0,,False
"For FF information problems, we found that query length was positively correlated with subjects' initial query ratings as well as their post-SERP ratings. We also observed that in most cases, subjects' initial ratings of query quality did not significantly differ from their post-SERP ratings. Only when a relatively long query was followed by a low quality SERP and when a relatively short query was followed by a good SERP did subjects change their ratings of queries. In cases of EX information problems where query length was held constant, people were also more consistent in how they adjusted their ratings when no relevant results or when many relevant results were found.",1,ad,True
"With respect to evaluation approaches, we found that subjects either took a selective or exhaustive approach when evaluating queries for FF information problems, and a selective, persistent or",0,,False
223,0,,False
"exhaustive approach when evaluating queries for EX information problems. This was slightly contrary to what we expected; we expected that most subjects would take a selective approach when evaluating FF information problem queries since the resolution of such problems only requires a single result. Subjects who took an exhaustive approach when evaluating FF problems assigned lower ratings to queries than those who took a selective approach, while the reverse was true for EX problems. In the Exit Interviews, subjects did not differentiate between FF and EX information problems, which was surprising since much is made about the differences in these types of tasks in the research community.",1,ad,True
"Finally, we found that the initial quality evaluations subjects gave to queries were fairly stable, changing very little during the reliability check. However, their post-SERP evaluations of queries for both types of information problem significantly increased during the reliability check. We found that subjects viewed significantly fewer documents and even clicked on different documents. While this might have been caused by fatigue, it is an open question as to whether query quality evaluations are stable or, if like ratings of other experience goods they are, by nature, brittle.",0,,False
"This study had several limitations; perhaps the most important was the limited number of topics and queries. This study was an initial exploration of this problem space. Using only one query per information problem and holding query length constant for information problems was necessary so that the number of experimental conditions would be manageable. Using a larger combination would have compromised our abilities to collect qualitative data, through interviews, about subjects' ratings. In the future, collecting a larger number of ratings for a larger number of topics and queries would likely enhance our understanding of users' evaluations of query quality.",1,ad,True
6. CONCLUSION,0,,False
"Our work explored how people make judgments about query quality; how these judgments are related to features of the query, information problem and search results; how reliable these judgments are; and what people's perceptions are of query recommendation. To our knowledge, this was one of the first systematic studies of how people make query quality evaluations. Our findings provide a useful starting-point for future useroriented studies of query quality evaluation and recommendation, and might also provide fodder for those working on automatic QPP methods. Future research will examine mechanisms for allowing users to express and share query quality ratings, and develop models of users' decision-making processes regarding query recommendations.",0,,False

We compare our approach with two classic approaches to bag-of-words queries using inverted indexes, term-at-a-time (TAAT) and document-at-atime (DAAT) query processing. We show that our framework is competitive with state-of-the-art indexing structures, and describe new capabilities provided by our algorithms that can be leveraged by future systems to improve effectiveness and efficiency for a variety of fundamental search operations.",1,ad,True

"Culpepper et al. [10] showed how to use the same wavelet tree to find the top-k documents (with raw term frequency weights) for a string P. Among all of the strategies proposed, the heuristic algorithm GREEDY worked best in practice. Despite the lack of worstcase theoretical guarantees, they show unadorned wavelet trees are efficient in time and space for this task. Hon et al. [22] presented a technique with worst-case performance guarantees. The HSV approach builds on the same document listing strategy originally proposed by Sadakane [37]. While HSV was originally described using individual self-indexes for each document as in Sadakane's approach [37], the method can be applied on top of either documentlisting solution in practice. The key insight of the HSV method is to precompute the top-k results for the lowest suffix tree nodes in a predetermined sampling range. Figure 1 shows a HSV tree over D. In this example, a sp, ep range of size g is precalculated and stored in a succinct suffix tree. An arbitrary query sp, ep is received. The bulk of the query result is already precomputed as sp, ep .

"For TAAT processing, a fixed number of accumulators are allocated, and the rank contribution incrementally calculated for each query term in increasing document order. When inverted files are stored on disk, the advantages of this method are clear. The inverted file for each term can be read into memory, and processed sequentially. However, when k is small relative to the total number of matching documents in collection, TAAT can be inefficient, particularly when the number of terms in the query increases, since all of the inverted lists must be processed before knowing the full rank score of each document. In early work, Buckley and Lewit [6] proposed using a heap of size k to allow posting lists to be evaluated in TAAT order. Processing is terminated when the sum of the contributions of the remaining lists cannot displace the minimum score in the heap.",1,ad,True
"Moffat and Zobel [29] improved on this pruning approach with two heuristics: STOP and CONTINUE. The STOP strategy is somewhat similar to the method of Buckley and Lewit, but the terms are processed in order of document frequency from least frequent to most frequent. When the threshold of k accumulators is reached, processing stops. In contrast, the CONTINUE method allows the current accumulators to be updated, but new accumulators cannot be added. These accumulator pruning strategies only approximate the true top-k result list.",1,ad,True
"If approximate results are acceptable, the TAAT approach can be made even more efficient using impact ordering [1, 2, 33]. The key idea of impact ordering is to precompute the TF for each document a term appears in. Next, quantize the TF values into a variable number of buckets, and sort the buckets (or blocks) for each term in decreasing impact order. Now, the top-k representative can be generated by sequentially processing each of the highest ranking term contribution blocks until a termination threshold is reached. The authors refer to this blockwise processing method as scoreat-a-time processing. Despite not using the full TF contribution for each term, Anh and Moffat [1] demonstrate that the effectiveness of impact ordered indexes is not significantly reduced, but efficiency is dramatically improved.",1,ad,True
5.2 Document-at-a-Time Processing (DAAT),0,,False
"The alternative approach is to process all of the terms simultaneously, one document at a time [8]. The advantage of this approach is that the final rank score is known as each document is processed, so it is relatively easy to maintain a heap containing exactly k scores. The disadvantage is that all of the term posting lists are cycled through for each iteration of the algorithm requiring nonsequential disk reads for multi-word queries. However, our focus in this paper is in-memory ranked retrieval, so DAAT tends to work very well in practice.",1,ad,True
"Pruning strategies to further increase efficiency also exist for DAAT processing. The most widely used pruning strategy for DAAT is MAXSCORE. Turtle and Flood [40] observed that the BM25 TF component can never exceed k1 + 1 ,"" 2.2. So, the total score contribution for any term is at most 2.2 · log(N/Nt). Using this observation, Turtle and Flood present an algorithm that allows posting values below the threshold to be skipped. As the minimum bounding score in the heap slowly increases, more and more postings can be omitted. Enhanced DAAT pruning strategies similar in spirit to MAXSCORE have been shown to further increase efficiency [4, 38].""",0,,False

If we assume the vocabulary is fixed for each collection, then the sp, ep range for each term can be precalculated and retrieved using a term map, as in the inverted indexing solution. This means that the FM-Index component is no longer necessary when processing bag-of-words queries. We refer to these hybrid approaches as SEM-GREEDY and SEM-HSV. These methods reduce the overall space requirements of our approach, but also limit the full functionality of some auxiliary operations. For example, the text can no longer be reproduced directly from the index, so snippets cannot be generated on the fly, and phrase queries are no longer natively supported. However, for classic bag-of-words queries, our hybrid approach provides an interesting trade-off to consider. Our final variation is to support a term-based self-index. We refer to this approach as FM-TERM.",1,WT,True
"It is also possible to support a DAAT query processing strategy in our retrieval system, but this would require efficiently supporting RMQ over the document array. Our approach currently supports a generalization of RMQ ­ RQQ. But, the cost of RQQ is O(log d) per k value extracted, while constant time solutions for RMQ currently exist [16]. However, an RMQ style approach as presented by Fischer and Heun [16] incurs an additional 2n bits of space, and so we do not explore the possibility further in this work.",1,MQ,True
"Also note the current top-k bag-of-words approach shown in GREEDY-TAAT is based entirely on the frequency counts of each item. This means that our current implementation only approximates the top-k items. This is a well-known problem in the inverted indexing domain. This limitation holds for any character-based bag-of-words self-indexing system that does frequency counting at query time since we can not guarantee that item k + 1 in any of the term lists does not have a higher score contribution than any item currently in the top-k intermediate list. A method of term contribution precalculation is required in order to support BM25 or language-model ranking. Without the term contribution scoring,",0,,False
"WAND and MAXSCORE enhancements are not possible, and therefore every document in the sp, ep must be evaluated in order to guarantee the final top-k ordering. However, this limitation can be mitigated by using HSV since we can precalculate the impact contribution for each sample position and store this value instead of storing only the frequency ordering. Top-k guarantees are also possible using a term-based self-indexing system where each distinct term is mapped to an integer using HSV or other succinct representations of term contribution preprocessing. In future work, we intend to fully examine all of the possibilities for top-k guarantees using self-indexes in various bag-of-words querying scenarios.",1,ad,True
"When using character-based self-indexing approaches for bagof-words queries, there is another disadvantage worth noting. For self-indexes, there is an efficiency trade-off between locating the top-k fd,t values and accurately determining ft since the index can extract exactly k fd,t values without processing every document. For a fixed vocabulary, ft is easily precomputed, and can be stored in the term map with the sp, ep pairs. But, in general it is not straightforward to determine ft for arbitrary strings over WTd without auxiliary algorithms and data structures to support calculating the value on the fly. The FM-HSV approach allows us to prestore ft for each sampled interval which can be be used to calculate ft over sp, ep more efficiently by only processing potential fringe leaves. Calculating ft using only WTd for arbitrary strings in near constant time using no additional space remains an open problem.",1,ad,True

"We report the timings for all of the self-indexing methods using the character-based indexes. We also ran the same experiments using our term-based indexes, but the performance was identical. This result is not surprising since the dominant cost in the selfindexing method is traversing the wavelet tree over the document array, and is dictated by the depth of the wavelet tree and not the overall length. Since the depth depends only on the number of documents, both approaches consistently produce similar running times. So, the only efficiency difference between character-based and term-based indexes is in space-usage which is discussed in Section 7.",0,,False
"We see that the self-indexing methods which must calculate all frequency scores (FM and SE) incur the most overhead as k increases. This is largely due to the multiplicative effect of collating many consecutive k values. For example, when collating frequency values from WTd, the number of rank operations is proportional to the depth of the wavelet tree. In the case of the TREC WT10G collection, which contains around 1.6 million documents, the depth of the wavelet tree is 24. So, the number of random rank probes in wavelet tree begins to significantly degrade the performance for larger k.",1,ad,True
"This effect can be marginalized by augmenting WTd with HSV. Since an HSV style index has a portion of each sp, ep ranges, only the fringe positions for each range need to be calculated at runtime, reducing the total number of page faults. For all k, the HSV indexes are efficient and remarkably resilient to outliers. In general, the WAND variant of DAAT is more efficient for large values of k, but can perform poorly for certain queries. For example, the query ""point out the steps to make the world free of pollution"" on the WT10G collection consistently performed poorly in our DAAT framework.",1,WT,True
7.3 Efficiency based on Query Length,1,Query,True
"We now break down the efficiency of each of our algorithms relative to two parameters: k and q, where q is the number of terms in a query. Figure 6 shows the average of 10 runs of 100 queries per query length, q. For one-word queries, for all values of k, the inverted indexing approaches DAAT and TAAT are superior. This is not surprising since only a single term posting must be traversed to calculate BM25, and the algorithms have excellent locality of access. Still, the HSV variant is the most efficient for small k.",0,,False
"For |q| > 1, the results also depend on k. For k , 10 and k ,"" 100, the self-indexing methods are more efficient than TAAT since the methods can extract exactly k values. Since the sample rates in the lower regions of the HSV methods are close to k, very little work needs to be done by the indexes. The WAND-based DAAT method remains remarkably efficient for all values of k. As k increases, the performance of the HSV-based approaches begins to degrade since the sample size for the precalculated top-k orderings grows exponentially. The performance degradation at large k is equivalent to Case (3) as described in Section 4. In essence, most of the sp, ep ranges turn out to be much smaller than any of the samples, so the complete sp, ep range must be computed at runtime, reducing the performance to FM-GREEDY when an appropriate sample is not available.

7.4 Space Usage,0,,False
"We now address the issue of space usage for the different algorithmic approaches. Inverted indexes are designed to take advantage of a myriad of different compression techniques. As such, our baselines also support several state-of-the-art byte and word aligned compression algorithms [3, 9, 28, 39, 43]. So, when we report the space usage for an inverted index, the numbers are reported using compressed inverted indexes and compressed document collections.",1,ad,True
"Figure 7 presents a break down of space usage for each component of the inverted indexing and self-indexing approaches. From a functionality perspective, there are several different componentization schemes to consider. First, consider the comparison of an inverted index method (including the term map, the postings list with p offsets, the document map, and the compressed document cache) with an FM-Index (including WTd, the document map, and any other precomputed values ­ for instance the HSV enhancement). We consider these two in-memory indexes as functionally equivalent, as both can support bag-of-words or phrase queries, and can recreate snippets or even the original uncompressed document. The character based variant FM is significantly larger, but able to support a range of special character and arbitrary substring queries that term-based indexes do not support. Therefore, the term-based self-indexing variant FM-TERM is much closer to the inverted indexing variant in space usage and functionality.",1,WT,True
"The second alternative are indexes that support only bag-of-words queries. Now, an inverted index method requires only the term map, the postings list without p offsets, and the document map. The character-based self-indexes are essentially the same, but the FM-",0,,False
"Index component is replaced with a term map component. Note that the FM component of FM-TERM is only required for phrase queries, and can also be dropped if only bag-of-words queries are required. When considering all of the current self-indexing options presented in this paper, using an FM-Index component instead of a term map appears to offer the most flexible configuration for character-based self-indexes, while the term-based variant is competitive in both time, space, and functionality with an inverted index.",1,ad,True
8. CONCLUSION,0,,False
We have presented an algorithmic framework for in-memory bagof-words query processing that is efficient in practice. We have compared and contrasted our framework with industry and academic standard inverted indexing algorithms. Our approach shows great promise for advancing the state-of-the-art in exciting new directions.,1,ad,True
"However, several challenges must be overcome before these algorithms can reach widespread acceptance. For instance, recent work has dramatically reduced the space required for self-indexing algorithms, there are still opportunities to further reduce space usage in self-indexes. Another shortcoming of bag-of-words querying with self-indexing algorithms is providing top-k guarantees. While good solutions exist for providing top-k guarantees on singleton pattern queries, optimally merging multiple queries remains problematic.",1,ad,True
"However, self-indexing algorithms can also efficiently provide functionality that is notoriously inefficient, and sometimes even impossible, using inverted indexes. In addition to basic bag-of-words queries, our approach has the capability to perform phrase queries of any length, as well as the ability to support complex statistical calculations at query time, with no additional indexing costs. In fact, phrase queries were shown to be significantly faster using FM-GREEDY than when using inverted indexing approaches in prior work [10]. Self-indexes also inherently preserve term proximity. So, not only can each term be found quickly, but the nterms surrounding the keyword can quickly be extracted, tabulated, and used for on-the-fly statistical calculations. Applications of this functionality include more efficient relevance feedback algorithms, construction of higher order language models in ranking metrics, or term dependency extraction and query expansion. In summary, all of the disadvantages outlined in this paper for self-indexing paper warrant further research, as the potential benefits of this new approach are compelling indeed.",1,ad,True
"In future work, we will explore new algorithmic approaches to reduce space usage, and to further improve efficiency for larger values of k. We also intend to investigate the combination of efficient phrase querying and proximity calculations to produce and evaluate novel ranking metrics. Finally, we will design and evaluate new approaches to support distributed in-memory query processing in order to scale our system to terabyte size collections.",0,,False

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Positional ranking functions, widely used in web search engines, improve result quality by exploiting the positions of the query terms within documents. However, it is well known that positional indexes demand large amounts of extra space, typically about three times the space of a basic nonpositional index. Textual data, on the other hand, is needed to produce text snippets. In this paper, we study time-space tradeoffs for search engines with positional ranking functions and text snippet generation. We consider both index-based and non-index based alternatives for positional data. We aim to answer the question of whether one should index positional data or not.",1,ad,True
"We show that there is a wide range of practical time-space trade-offs. Moreover, we show that both position and textual data can be stored using about 71% of the space used by traditional positional indexes, with a minor increase in query time. This yields considerable space savings and outperforms, both in space and time, recent alternatives from the literature. We also propose several efficient compressed text representations for snippet generation, which are able to use about half of the space of current state-of-the-art alternatives with little impact in query processing time.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Web search has become an important part of day-to-day life, affecting even the way in which people think and remember things [35]. Indeed, web search engines are one of the most important tools that give access to the huge amount of information stored in the web. The success of a web search engine mostly depends on its efficiency and the quality of its ranking function. To achieve efficient processing of queries, search engines use highly optimized data structures, including inverted indexes [6, 10, 25]. State-ofthe-art ranking functions, on the other hand, combine simple term-based ranking schemes such as BM25 [10], link-based methods such as Pagerank [7] or Hits [24], and up to several hundred other features derived from documents and search query logs.",0,,False
"Recent work has focused on positional ranking functions [32, 27, 36, 28, 33, 40, 10] that improve result quality by considering the positions of the query terms in the documents. Thus, documents where the query terms occur close to each other might be ranked higher, as this could indicate that the document is highly relevant for the query. To support such positional ranking, the search engine must have access to the position data. This is commonly done by building an index for all term positions within documents, called a positional index. The goal is to obtain an index that is efficient in terms of both index size and access time.",0,,False
"As shown in [32], positional ranking can be carried out in two phases. First, a simple term-based ranking scheme (such as BM25) defined over a Boolean filter is used to determine a set of high-scoring documents, say, the top 200 documents. In the second phase, the term positions are used to rerank these documents by refining their score values. (Additional third or fourth phases may be used to do further reranking according to hundreds of additional features [38], but",1,ad,True
255,0,,False
"this is orthogonal to our work.) Once the final set of topscoring documents has been determined (say, the top 10), it is necessary to generate appropriate text snippets, typically text surrounding the term occurrences, to return as part of the result page. This requires access to the actual text in the indexed web pages. It is well known [40, 21] that storing position data requires a considerable amount of space, typically about 3 to 5 times the space of an inverted index storing only document identifiers and term frequencies. Furthermore, storing the documents for snippet generation requires significant additional space.",1,ad,True
"This paper focuses on alternative approaches to performing the above two-step document ranking process and the query snippet-generation phase. The aim is to optimize both space and query processing time. One important feature of position data is that it only needs to be accessed for a limited number of promising documents, say a few dozens or hundreds of documents. This access pattern differs from that for document identifiers and term frequencies, which are accessed more frequently, making access speed much more important. For position data, on the other hand, we could consider somewhat slower but smarter alternative representations without losing too much efficiency at query time [40].",0,,False
"In this paper, we push this idea further and consider not storing the position data (i.e, the positional index) at all. Instead, we compute positions on the fly from a compressed representation of the text collection. We will study two alternative approaches to compressing the text collection: (1) wavelet trees [23], which are succinct data structures from the combinatorial pattern matching community, and (2) compressed document representations that support fast extraction of arbitrary documents. It has been shown that, compared to positional indexes, web-scale texts can often be compressed in much less space [21]. More importantly, these representations can be used for both positional reranking and snippet generation. One concern is how these alternatives impact query processing speed, and thus we will study the resulting trade-offs between running time and space requirement.",1,ad,True
"Thus, to index or not to index position data, that is the research question that we hope to answer in this paper. To our knowledge, such alternative approaches for implementing positional ranking functions have not been rigorously compared before. Our main result is that we can store all the information needed for query processing (i.e., document identifiers, term frequencies, position data, and text) using space close to that of state-of-the-art positional indexes (which only store position data and thus cannot be used for snippet creation), with only a minor increase in query processing time. Thus, we provide new alternatives for practical compression of position and text data, outperforming recent approaches in [34].",0,,False
"Following current practice in search engines [21, 14], we assume a scenario where there is enough space to maintain index data structures completely in main memory, in compressed form. In this scenario, large text collections are usually partitioned over a number of nodes in a cluster, such that each partition fits into the memory of its node. This paper focuses on how to organize data within each partition, as also assumed in previous work such as [21, 14].",0,,False
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK,0,,False
"Let D ,"" {D1, . . . , DN } be a document collection of size N ,""",0,,False
"where each document is represented as a sequence Di[1..ni] of ni terms from a vocabulary  ,"" {1, . . . , V }. Notice that every term is represented by an integer, hence the documents are just arrays of integers. We also identify each document Di with a unique document identifier (docID) i. Given a term t   and a document Di  D, the in-document positions of t in Di is the set {j|Di[j] "", t}.",0,,False
"Throughout this paper, we assume that all term separators (like spaces, `,', `;', `.', etc.) have been removed from the text. Also, we assume that all terms in the vocabulary have been represented in a case-insensitive way. This is in order to facilitate the search operations that we need to carry out over the documents in order to compute (on the fly) the positions of a given query term. To be able to retrieve the original text (with separators and the original case) one can use the presentation layer introduced by Farin~a et al. [17, Section 4]. This also supports removing stopwords and the use of stemming, among other vocabulary techniques. This extra layer requires extra space on top of that of the compressed text, as well as extra time to obtain the original text. However, this scheme must be used on all the alternatives that we consider in this paper, and thus we disregard the overhead introduced by the presentation layer and focus only on the low-level details of compression (but keeping in mind that the original text can still be retrieved).",1,ad,True
2.1 Inverted Index Compression,0,,False
"The efficiency of query processing in search engines relies on inverted indexes. These data structures store a set of inverted lists I1, . . . , IV , which are accessed through a vocabulary table. The list It maintains a posting for each document containing the term t  . Usually, a posting in an inverted list consists of a docID, a term frequency, and the in-document positions of the term. (In real systems, the docIDs, term frequencies and in-document positions are often stored separately.) Indexes whose postings store indocument positions are called positional inverted indexes.",0,,False
"We assume that an inverted list It is divided into blocks of 128 documents each -- the particular choice of 128 documents per block is an implementation issue. Given a block of It, the term-position data for all the documents in that block are stored in a separate block of variable size. The inverted lists of the query terms are used to produce the result for the query. Since the query results are usually large, the result set must be ranked by relevance.",0,,False
"For large document collections, the data stored in inverted indexes requires considerable amounts of space. Hence, the indexes must be compressed. To support efficient query processing (such as DAAT [10], WAND [9] or BMW OR [15]) and effective compression in the inverted lists, we sort them by increasing docID. Let dt[1..|It|] denote the sorted list of docIDs for the inverted list It. Then, we replace dt[1] with dt[1] - 1, and dt[i] with dt[i] - dt[i - 1] - 1 for i ,"" 2, . . . , |It|. In the case of frequencies, every fi is replaced with fi - 1, since fi > 0 always holds. For the positions, each pi,j is replaced with pi,j - pi,j-1 - 1. Then these values are encoded with integer compression schemes that take advantage of the resulting smaller integers.""",1,ad,True
"There has been a lot of progress on compressing docIDs and frequencies, with many compression methods available [41, 10]. Some of them achieve, in general, a very good compression ratio, but at the expense of a lower decompression speed [10], for example Elias  and  encodings",0,,False
256,0,,False
"[16], or Golomb/Rice parametric encodings [22], interpolative encoding [30]. Other methods achieve a (slightly) lower compression ratio, though with much higher decompression speed, for example VByte [39], S9 [3], and PForDelta [42], among others [10]. The best compression method depends on the scenario at hand.",0,,False
2.2 Positional Indexes,0,,False
"Unfortunately, the scenario is not the same for compressing term positions, which is a problem where it has been difficult to make much progress. For instance, previous work [40] concludes that term positions in the documents do not follow simple distributions that could be used to improve compression (as is the case of, for instance, docIDs and frequencies). As a result, a positional index is about 3 to 5 times larger than a docID/frequency index, and becomes a bottleneck in index compression. Another important conclusion from [40] is that we may only have to access a limited amount of position data per query, and thus it might be preferable to use a method that compresses well even if its speed is slightly lower.",0,,False
"Positions in inverted indexes are used mainly in two applications, phrase searching and positional ranking schemes. In this paper we study positional ranking, where the positions of the query terms within the documents are used to improve the performance of a standard ranking such as BM25. The rationale is that documents where the query terms appear close together could be more relevant for the query, so they should get a better score. Although we focus only on positional ranking functions, the compression schemes used in this paper allow for phrase searching as well. This scenario is left for future work.",0,,False
"A recent work on positional indexing is that of Shan et al [34]. They propose to use the flat position indexes [11, 14] as an alternative of positional inverted indexes. The result is that docIDs, term frequencies and position data can be stored in space close to that of positional inverted lists, yielding a reduction of space usage. However, this index does not store the text, which makes it less suitable in scenarios where text snippets must be generated.",0,,False
2.3 Snippet Generation,0,,False
"Besides providing a ranking of the most relevant documents for a query, search engines must show query snippets and support accessing the ""in-cache"" version of the documents. Each snippet shows a portion of the result document, in order to help the user judge its likely relevance before accessing it. Turpin et al. [37] introduce a method to compress the text collection and support fast text extraction to generate snippets. However, to achieve fast extraction, they must use a compression scheme that uses more space than usual compressors. In a more recent work, Ferragina and Manzini [21] study how to store very large text collections in compressed form, such that the documents can be accessed when needed, and show how different compressors behave in such a scenario. One of their main concerns was how compressors can capture redundancies that arise very far apart in very long texts. Their results show that such large texts can often be compressed to just 5% of their original size.",0,,False

The latter [5, 4] extends [8] by supporting more IR-like operations on a WT. The result is that a WT can represent a document collection using n(H0 (T ) + 1) + o(n(H0(T ) + 1)) bits while supporting all the functionality of an inverted index.

A contribution of our present work is a compressed self-index that is able to store web-scale texts and is competitive with the best state-of-the-art compressors.

One of our most interesting results is that both position and textual data can be stored in about 71% the space of current positional inverted indexes.",1,ad,True

It is important to note that variants of the scheme in [37] have been adopted by some commercial search engines, which makes our results of practical interest.",1,ad,True

We show how to improve the compression ratio by compressing the sequence associated to every node of the tree with standard compressors. The result is a practical web-scale compressed self-index that is competitive with the best state-ofthe-art compressors.",0,,False
4. COMPRESSING TERM-POSITION AND TEXTUAL DATA,0,,False
"Compressing in-document positions, i.e., the positions where each term occur within a document, has been recognized as a difficult task [40, 21]. Indeed, positions have become a bottleneck for compression compared to docIDs and frequencies. Moreover, recent work shows that the textual data can be compressed better than positions [21]. There are two main reasons for this. First, positions have a different distribution than docIDs and frequencies [40]. Second, since positions are stored separately for each term (recall Section 2.1), the local context for terms that is exploited by text compression schemes is not available in the positional inverted lists. Usually, positions require about 3 to 5 times the space of an inverted index storing docIDs and frequencies. Thus, efficient compression of in-document positions is an important challenge.",0,,False
"Positional inverted indexes are the standard solution to this problem [25, 10, 6]. In particular, [40] shows a detailed study of alternative ways to compress positional inverted indexes. However, it is not clear that using the methods in [40] is the best one can do. Notice that the in-document position data can be obtained (at query time) by searching for the query terms in the documents -- a simple scan of the document suffices. Since textual data can be compressed much better than positions, this could decrease the space usage of positions. However, the question is how this impacts query performance. We investigate this issue in this paper. We assume that positions are used to support positional ranking as described in [10, 40].",0,,False
"Another important issue in web search engines is the ability to generate snippets for the query results that allow users to decide which of the result documents they should visit. In this context, snippets have been shown to improve the effectiveness of search engines. To provide snippets, a search engine must store a (simplified) version of the documents in the collection. In the case of web search engines, this means the entire textual web, which requires a considerable amount of resources. Thus, the textual data must be compressed [21].",0,,False

Step 2 is usually supported by a positional inverted index [25, 10, 40]. Step 3 is supported by compressing the document collection and supporting the extraction of arbitrary documents. Our focus here is on alternative ways to implement the last two steps.""",1,ad,True

"Positional inverted lists (PILs, for short) are the standard approach for indexing in-document position data in search engines [25, 10, 6]. In particular, we assume the representation explained in Section 2.1. To obtain position data at query time, given the docIDs of the top-k1 results for a given query, we identify the PIL blocks containing the desired positional index entries. Then these blocks are fully decompressed, and the corresponding positions are obtained. A drawback here is that we need to decompress the entire PIL block, even if we only need a single entry in it. Thus, we might end up decompressing, in the worst case, k1 blocks in each of the inverted lists involved in the query. Afterwards, these positions are used to rerank the top-k1 documents, as in [40].",0,,False
"The access pattern for position data is much sparser than that for docIDs and frequencies, since positions must be obtained only for the top-k1 documents. Thus, just a few positions are decompressed from the PIL in each query. Given this sparse access pattern and the high space requirement of positions (as discussed above), it is better to use compression methods with a good compression ratio, like Golomb/Rice compression. These are slower to decompress, yet the fact that only a few positions are decompressed should not impact in the overall query running time.",0,,False

Hence, we can use Rice to compress PILs and obtain a better space usage with only a minor increase in query time. For Rice, PILs use 2.91 times the space of the inverted index that stores docIDs and frequencies. For S16, this number is 3.22.",0,,False

In particular, we show results for lzma (which gives very good results in [21]) and Google's snappy compressor [1], which is an LZ77 compressor that is optimized for speed rather than compression ratio. These two compressors offer the most interesting trade-offs among the alternatives we tried. As it can be seen, lzma achieves much better compression ratios than snappy. The compressed space achieved for the whole text is 8,133 MB for lzma and 27,388 MB for snappy.",1,ad,True
"The differences in extraction time are also considerable, with snappy being much faster. Note that [21] reports a decompression speed of about 35MB/sec for lzma. However, to obtain a given document we must first decompress the entire block that contains it. Hence, most of the 35MB per second do not correspond to any useful data. In other words, this does not measure effective decompression speed for our scenario, and thus we report per-query times rather than MB/s for both methods.",0,,False

In rows 3 and 4 of Table 2 we show the time-space trade-offs for this approach, using lzma and snappy compressors, and blocks of size 0.2 MB. We conclude that using lzma we can store positions and text in about half the space of PIL(the latter just storing positions). However, this approach is two orders of magnitude slower than the positional index. If we use snappy instead, we obtain an index that is 21.86% larger than PIL (Rice), and running times to obtain positions that are about an order of magnitude slower (this might be acceptable in some cases). In the following, we try to improve on both of these techniques.",1,ad,True
Zero-order Compressors with Fast Text Extraction.,0,,False
"An alternative to compressing the text that could support faster position lookups is the approach from Turpin et al. [37].

In this way, the term identifier 0 corresponds to the most frequent term in the collection, 1",0,,False
"to the second most frequent term, and so on. The document collection is then represented as a single sequence of identifiers, where each term identifier is encoded using VByte [2]. Note that the 128 most frequent terms in the collection are thus encoded in a single byte. Actually, [37] uses a move-to-front strategy to store the encodings: the first time a term appears in a document, it is encoded with the original code assigned as before; the remaining appearances are represented as an offset to the previous occurrence of the term. We also use this approach in our experiments.",0,,False
"By using an integer compression scheme (such as VByte) for the text, we are able to decompress any text portion very efficiently (no text blocks are needed this time). Table 2 shows the resulting trade-offs for this alternative (see the row for ""VByte""). Notice that we improve the query time significantly, making it competitive with PILs. The higher space usage is a concern, but note that we also represent the text within this space, not just the position data as in PILs. We also tried other compression schemes, such as PForDelta and S9, obtaining poorer compression ratios and similar decompression speed. The only method that improved the compression ratio is VNibble, a variant of VByte that represents any integer with a variable number of nibbles (i.e., half bytes). As in VByte, one bit of each nibble is used as a continuation bit, so only 3 bits of each nibble are used to represent the number. The results of Table 2 show space savings of about 10% over VByte. Also, notice that we are now able to use space close to that of snappy (with blocks of 0.2 MB), yet with a better query time.",1,ad,True
"The fast query time is due to two facts. First, methods like VByte and VNibble are able to decompress hundred of million integers (which in our case correspond to terms) per second [41]. Second, VByte and VNibble are able to decompress just the desired documents, without negative impact on compressed size. However, this is basically zeroorder compression, and hence we are still far from the space usage of, for instance, lzma. We address this next.",1,ad,True
Natural-Language Compression Boosters.,0,,False
"To obtain higher-order compression, we propose to use a so-called natural-language compression booster [18]. The idea is to use first a zero-order compressor on the text, then this compressed text is further compressed using some standard compression scheme. It has been shown that this can yield better compression ratios than just just using a standard compression scheme [18] (especially for smaller block sizes). In our case, we propose using Turpin et al's approach [37] as booster (using VByte and VNibble as we explained above) on the sequence of term identifiers, rather than Word Huffman or End-Tagged as in [18]. Our experiments indicate that the former are faster and use only slightly more space than the latter.",0,,False

We show results for blocks of size 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.2 MB of VByte and VNibble compressed text. Overall, the reduction in space usage (compared to the original VByte approach) is considerable. Compared to lzma (0.2 MB), the result is a reduction in space usage of 16.68% (12,486 MB vs 14,987 MB), but at the cost of twice the running time as the original lzma. When using smaller blocks, however, the time to obtain positions rapidly improves, while the size does not increase too much. For snappy, on the other hand, we obtain a",1,ad,True

We note that using more advanced techniques from [40] we could obtain about 21 to 22 GB of space for PIL, making both techniques competitive in both space and time.

Byte-Oriented Huffman WT.,1,WT,True
"Instead of a bit-oriented WT (as the ones explained in Section 2.4), we use the byte-oriented representation from [8], using the Plain Huffman encoder, which is the most efficient alternative reported in there. The idea is to first assign a Huffman code to each vocabulary term [29]. Then, we store the most significant byte of the encoding of each term in array Broot. That is, each WT node v stores an array of bytes Bv, instead of bit arrays as in Section 2.4. Next, each term in the text is assigned to one of the children of the root, depending on the first byte in the encodings. Notice that in this way the WT is 256-ary. See [8] for details.",1,ad,True
"To support rank and select, we use the simple approach from [8]. Given a WT node v, we divide the corresponding byte sequence Bv into superblocks of sb bytes each. For each superblock we store 256 superblock counters, one for each possible byte. These counters tell us how many occurrences",1,WT,True

"of a given byte there are in the text up to the last position of the previous superblock. Also, each superblock is divided into blocks of b bytes each. Every such block also stores 256 block counters, similarly as before. The difference is that the values of these counters are local to the superblock, hence less bits are used for them. To compute rankc(T, i), we first compute the superblock j that contains i, and use the superblock counter for c to count how many c there are in T up to superblock j - 1. Then we compute the block i that contains i and add (to the previous value) the block counter for c. Finally, we must count the number of c within block i . This is done with a sequential scan over block i . This block/superblock structure allows for time-space trade-offs. In our experiments we use sb ,"" 216. Hence, superblock counters can be stored in 16 bits each. We consider b "","" 1 KB, b "", 3 KB and b , 7 KB. Operation select is implemented by binary searching the superblock/block counters; thus no extra information is stored for this [8].",1,ad,True
"To obtain position data assume that, given docID i for a top-k1 document and a query term t, we want to obtain the positions of t within Di. A simple solution could be to extract document Di from the WT, and then search for t within it (as in Section 4.3). However, the decompression speed of a WT is much slower than that of the schemes used in Section 4.3, so we must use a more efficient way. An idea is to use operation select to find every occurrence of t within Di, hence working in time proportional to the number of occurrences of the term. Let d be the starting position for document Di in T . Hence, there are r  rankt(T, d) occurrences of t before document Di, and the first occurrence of t within Di is at position j  selectt(T, r + 1), the second occurrence at position j  selectt(T, r + 2), and so on. Overall, if o is the number of occurrences of t within Di, then we need 1 rank and o + 1 selects to find them.",1,WT,True
"In Table 2 we show the experimental trade-offs for WT, for the different block sizes tested.

Moreover, WT (7 KB) is slower than PIL (Rice) and uses more space. The WT, on the other hand, includes the textual data, but still this space usage could leave it out of competition. Next, we introduce extra improvements to make them more competitive.",1,ad,True
Achieving Higher-Order Compression with the WT.,1,WT,True
"Basically, WTs are zero-order compressors, which explains their high space usage. To achieve higher-order compression, notice that Broot contains the most significant byte of the Huffman encodings of the original terms. Thus, the original text structure is at least partially preserved in the structure of Broot, which might thus be as compressible as the original text. A similar behavior can be observed in internal nodes. Thus, we propose to compress the blocks of Bv in each WT node v by using some standard compressor.",1,WT,True

As one of the most relevant points in the trade-off, we propose a compressed document representation based on the approach in [37] combined with Google's snappy compression [1]. This allows us to compute position and snippet data using less space than a standard positional inverted index that only stores position data.

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Most queries in web search are ambiguous and multifaceted. Identifying the major senses and facets of queries from search log data, referred to as query subtopic mining in this paper, is a very important issue in web search. Through search log analysis, we show that there are two interesting phenomena of user behavior that can be leveraged to identify query subtopics, referred to as `one subtopic per search' and `subtopic clarification by keyword'. One subtopic per search means that if a user clicks multiple URLs in one query, then the clicked URLs tend to represent the same sense or facet. Subtopic clarification by keyword means that users often add an additional keyword or keywords to expand the query in order to clarify their search intent. Thus, the keywords tend to be indicative of the sense or facet. We propose a clustering algorithm that can effectively leverage the two phenomena to automatically mine the major subtopics of queries, where each subtopic is represented by a cluster containing a number of URLs and keywords. The mined subtopics of queries can be used in multiple tasks in web search and we evaluate them in aspects of the search result presentation such as clustering and re-ranking. We demonstrate that our clustering algorithm can effectively mine query subtopics with an F1 measure in the range of 0.896-0.956. Our experimental results show that the use of the subtopics mined by our approach can significantly improve the state-of-the-art methods used for search result clustering. Experimental results based on click data also show that the re-ranking of search result based on our method can significantly improve the efficiency of users' ability to find information.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Understanding the search intent of users is essential for satisfying a user's search needs. How to best represent query intent is still an ongoing research problem. One consensus among the researchers is that the intents of queries can be characterized along multiple dimensions. The intents of a query can be represented by its search goals, such as informational, navigational, and transactional [7]. It can also be represented by semantic categories or topics [8, 23, 24]. Furthermore, it can be represented by subtopics (cf., [14]), denoting multiple senses or multiple facets of the query.",0,,False
"Most queries are ambiguous or multifaceted [14]. For example, `harry shum' is an ambiguous query, which may refer to an American actor, a vice president of Microsoft, or another person named Harry Shum. `Xbox' is a multifaceted query. When people search for `xbox', they may be looking for information on different facets of an Xbox, such as `online game', `homepage', and `marketplace'. Note that a query can be both ambiguous and multifaceted. The more frequent a query is, the more likely that it has multiple senses or facets. The major difference between the topics and subtopics of a query is that the former is more coarsegrained and related to other queries, while the latter is finegrained and is only about the query in question.",0,,False
"Identifying the major subtopics of a query is very important for many search tasks such as personalized search, query suggestion, and search result presentation including clustering, re-ranking, and diversification. In this paper, we aim to automatically mine the major subtopics (senses and facets) of queries from the search log data. Although there is some related work, the subtopic mining problem as defined in this paper does not seem to have been studied previously.",0,,False
"We performed a comprehensive study of the two phenomena, referred to as `one subtopic per search' (OSS) and `subtopic clarification by additional keyword' (SCAK) respectively. We show that we can mine the subtopics of queries from search log data by effectively using the phenomena. We then represent the senses or facets of a query",1,ad,True

"If a user clicks multiple URLs after submitting a query (the multiple URLs are also referred to as multi-clicks in this paper), then the clicked URLs tend to represent the same subtopic, which is called one subtopic per search (OSS). Figure 1 shows an example of search results for the query `harry shum' on a web search engine. The result contains URLs about two Harry Shum's. The search log data indicates that URLs 1, 3, and 5 are usually clicked together in individual searches, and URLs 2 and 4 are clicked together. Each group of URLs actually corresponds to one sense, i.e., one subtopic. Gale and Church discovered a similar phenomenon in natural language texts, called `one sense per discourse' [19], which means an ambiguous word usually only has one sense in a specific context. Users often add ad-",1,ad,True

"ditional keywords (in most cases, one additional keyword) to a query to expand the query in order to clarify its subtopic. This phenomenon is called subtopic clarification by additional keyword (SCAK). As a result, the URLs clicked after searching both with the original and the expanded queries tend to represent the same subtopic and the keyword also tends to be indicative of the subtopic. For example, people may submit `harry shum microsoft' as an expanded query to specify the subtopic. The URLs clicked in searches for both `harry shum' and `harry shum microsoft' usually represent the same subtopic, Harry Shum from Microsoft, and therefore `microsoft' becomes a keyword of the subtopic.",1,ad,True
"We employ a clustering algorithm to group URLs as well as keywords into clusters, where each cluster represents one subtopic of a query. For example, one cluster for query `harry shum' may contain the home page of the Microsoft Harry Shum, his wiki profile, and the keywords `microsoft' and `bing'. The clustering is performed based on the two phenomena of user behavior, as described above. Specifically, for each query and its expanded queries (the original query plus keywords), the related click log data is collected. Clustering is then carried out on all the clicked URLs. If two URLs are clicked together many times in the click data, then they are likely to be clustered together. If two URLs are clicked both under the original and expanded queries, then they are likely to be clustered together. We employ a special data structure consisting of a prefix tree and a suffix",1,wiki,True

"We conducted experiments to measure the accuracy of our clustering method on a TREC data set and a new data set in which the subtopics of both queries are labeled. For ambiguous subtopics, our method can achieve a B-cubed F1 from 0.925 to 0.956. For multifaceted subtopics, our method can achieve a B-cubed F1 from 0.896 to 0.930 in terms of B-cubed F1. The results indicate that our method can effectively perform query subtopic mining.",1,TREC,True
"We also evaluated our method in search result clustering. We compared our method with a state-of-the-art method of search result clustering. Experimental results show that our method can significantly improve accuracy. The improvements are 5.4% in terms of B-cubed precision and 6.1% in terms of B-cubed recall. When compared side-by-side with human generated results, we also find that our method is significantly better than the baseline.",0,,False
"We further evaluated our method on search result reranking, in which the user is confirmed with the subtopic she has in mind and re-ranking of search results based on user feedback is performed. We used the average click position in the log data as the evaluation measure. The results show that our method can boost the average click position 0.61 points higher, which implies a promising improvement in the user experience.",0,,False
There are three major contributions in our work: 1. We have analyzed two phenomena in user search behavior that can be utilized to identify query subtopics. 2. We have developed a clustering method that can effectively and efficiently mine the subtopics on the basis of the phenomena and use them to represent query subtopics. 3. We have successfully applied the mined results to two tasks: search result clustering and re-ranking. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces related work. Section 3 describes the detailed analysis of user behavior in the log data for subtopic mining. Section 4 explains our approach to subtopic mining and Section 5 presents the experimental results. Section 6 presents two applications of our subtopic mining algorithm. Section 7 concludes the paper.,0,,False

2.1 Search Log Mining,0,,False
"The intent of a query can be characterized along several dimensions, including search goals [7], semantic classes [5], topics [4], and subtopics [14]. The search goals can be informational, navigational, or transactional. The semantic classes of a query can be represented by ODP categories1. The topics or subtopics of a query can be represented by a number of queries or URLs. Topics are usually more coarse-grained and can cover multiple queries, while subtopics are more fine-grained and associated with a specific query [14]. For example, for the query `xbox', all aspects related to Xbox including online game, market place, and even other game consoles are usually included in the topic of the query. In contrast, each aspect of Xbox is represented by one subtopic of the query.",1,ODP,True

Methods for performing the task have been proposed (e.g., [4, 10, 15, 18, 21, 25, 27]). Beeferman et al. [4], for example, proposed conducting clustering on a click-through bipartite graph and viewing the obtained clusters as topics covering multiple queries. Radlinski et al. [25] proposed first using search session data to find similar queries, and then using a click-through bipartite graph to refine the discovered queries that are similar, and finally grouping the similar queries into the same clusters. The clusters containing the same query are then regarded as topics of the query.",1,ad,True
"There are some similarities but also significant differences between our work and Radlinski et al.'s work. 1) The problem settings are different. In their work, a subtopic is represented by multiple queries, while in our work a subtopic is represented by keywords and URLs. 2) The information used for subtopic mining is different. They used search sessions to find frequently co-occurring query pairs, considered them candidates of similar query pairs, and finally used a click-through bipartite graph to filter unlikely queries. 3) The goals are also different. The mined results in their work were utilized for manual creation of TREC data. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluated our method on two search tasks, namely search result clustering and re-ranking.",1,ad,True
"Methods for utilizing a user's click behavior in individual searches have been developed, e.g., [12, 15]. Existing work aimed at modeling and predicting a user's click behavior while our work attempts to find the subtopics of queries. The exploitation of the prefix and suffix relationship between queries was also considered in the previous work, e.g., [26]. In our work, we not only use the prefix and suffix relationship between queries, but also the clicked URLs of the queries and our goal is to conduct query subtopic mining.",0,,False

"One subtopic per search (OSS) means that the jointly clicked URLs in a specific search are likely to represent the same subtopic. We conducted analysis on the phenomenon with a search log data set from a commercial web search engine (DataSetA as described in Table 8) and validated the correctness of this hypothesis. Our explanation of the phenomenon is: 1) Search users are rational and they do not randomly click on search results (cf., [1, 20]). 2) Users usually have one single subtopic in mind for a particular search.",0,,False
"Table 1 shows two groups of multi-clicked URLs (i.e., the multiple URLs clicked by a user in a query) from search logs for the query `harry shum'. The three URLs in the first group are about one sense and the two URLs in the second group are about another sense. Users may accidently click URLs belonging to two different groups, but such cases are rare. This is reasonable, because if a user searches for a specific person then she usually would only click the URLs about the person and skip the URLs about other people. We call such user behavior `one subtopic per search'. We examined the accuracy of using one subtopic per search as a rule for subtopic identification. By accuracy we mean the percentage of the multi-clicks that share the same subtopics among all multi-clicks. We sampled 10,000 groups of multiclicks of individual queries in DataSetA, which are labeled based on the sense or facet. When all the URLs within the multi-clicks are about the same sense or facet, we consider that the rule has correctly identified a subtopic. Table 2 shows the accuracy versus the number of multi-clicks. We can see that the average accuracy of one subtopic per search is about 84%, suggesting that it is very helpful for identifying the subtopics of queries. Table 2 also shows that the accu-",0,,False

6.2.1 Our Method,0,,False
"When the search system provides the results to the user, there might be multiple ways to present it if the query contains multiple subtopics, i.e., it is ambiguous or multifaceted. These include simple ranking, clustering of URLs by subtopics, dynamic ranking of URLs belonging to the same topic, as well as re-ranking of URLs by subtopics.",0,,False
"Re-ranking is conducted in the following way. The user is first asked which subtopic she is interested in, with the subtopics shown at the top of the results page. When the user selects a subtopic, the URLs belonging to the subtopic will be moved to the top (re-ranked). The relative order between URLs inside and outside of the subtopic will be kept. The subtopics are assumed to be represented by keywords of subtopics mined with our method.",0,,False
"Figure 8 shows an example UI in which re-ranking is performed for the query `harry shum.' The second subtopic of the query is selected and all the URLs belonging to it are re-ranked at the top. This will significantly improve a user's experience compared with the conventional approach (Figure 1). Although re-ranking is a simple, interactive approach to search results presentation (cf., [28]), there seems to be no study before on the approach to the best of our knowledge.

"Next, we used the same log data to estimate the cost for users based on re-ranking. We assumed that the cost for the user to check the subtopics and click one of them is 1.0, because the subtopics are shown in one line at the top, and examining them is almost equivalent to examining the title and snippet of a URL. The cost of finding the last click within each selected subtopic can be calculated by using the search log data, because within the subtopic the ranking order is preserved. Note that because of the one subtopic per search phenomenon, the clicked URLs in a search usually belong to the same subtopic. We calculated the average position of last clicked URLs belonging to the same subtopics in the 20, 000 searches and found that it is 1.80.",0,,False

7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK,0,,False
"In this paper, we have studied the problem of query subtopic mining. Specifically, we have discovered two phenomena of user search behavior that can be used as signals to mine major senses and facets of ambiguous and multifaceted queries. One is called one subtopic per search and the other subtopic clarification by additional keyword. We have developed a clustering algorithm that can effectively and efficiently mine query subtopics on the basis of the two phenomena. We have evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. On the TREC dataset, the F1-measure is 0.925 for finding ambiguous subtopics and 0.896 for finding multifaceted subtopics. When applied to search result clustering, our method can improve precision by 5.4% and recall by 6.1%. The effectiveness of our method has also been verified in search result re-ranking, using click data.",1,ad,True

"hance our current work. First, only three types of features were used in the current clustering algorithm. We plan to investigate the use of other features to further improve the accuracy. Second, we only tried one clustering algorithm as an example. Other existing algorithms can be applied as well. Third, the mined subtopics by our method were only applied to two applications, and they can be useful in other applications as well. We also plan to try some other applications such as personalized search and search result diversification. Finally, our method can only be employed when there is enough search log data, which is also a drawback for most log mining algorithms. How to apply the approach in tail queries is also an issue we need to consider.",0,,False

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Conventional search engines usually return a ranked list of web pages in response to a query. Users have to visit several pages to locate the relevant parts. A promising future search scenario should involve: (1) understanding user intents; (2) providing relevant information directly to satisfy searchers' needs, as opposed to relevant pages. In this paper, we present a paradigm for dealing with informational queries. We aim to summarize a query's information from different aspects. Query aspects are aligned to user intents. The generated summaries for query aspects are expected to be both specific and informative, so that users can easily and quickly find relevant information. Specifically, we use a ""Composite Query for Summarization"" method, which leverages the search engine to proactively gather information by submitting multiple composite queries according to the original query and its aspects. In this way, we could get more relevant information for each query aspect and roughly classify information. By comparative mining the search results of different composite queries, it is able to identify query (dependent) aspect words, which help to generate more specific and informative summaries. The experimental results on two data sets, Wikipedia and TREC ClueWeb2009, are encouraging. Our method outperforms two baseline methods on generating informative summaries.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Nowadays, accessing information on the Internet through search engines has become a fundamental life activity. Current web search engines usually provide a ranked list of URLs to answer a query. This type of information access does a good job for dealing with simple navigational queries by leading users to specific websites. However, it is becoming increasingly insufficient for queries with vague or complex information need. Many queries serve just as the start of an exploration of related information space. Users may want to know about a topic from multiple aspects. Organizing the web content relevant to a query according to user intents would benefit user exploration. In addition, a list of URLs couldn't directly satisfy user information need. Users have to visit many pages and try to find relevant parts within long pages, since the information may be scattered across documents. The long-standing goal of search engines should be providing relevant information, as opposed to relevant documents, to directly satisfy searchers' needs.",1,ad,True
"This paper presents a novel search paradigm that the system should automatically discover information and present an informative overview for a query from multiple aspects. We target on dealing with informational queries. A query represents a centric topic, and the query aspects are aligned to user intents covering diverse information needs. The query aspects could be specified explicitly by users through an interface or automatically mined from search logs or other resources [4, 18, 22, 25]. In this paper, we use simple methods to do aspect mining and mainly focus on multi-aspect oriented query summarization: given a query and a set of aspects, generate a summary for each query aspect, which is expected to provide specific and informative content to users directly and helps for further exploration. Figure 1 shows an example of the system output.",1,ad,True
"We further formulate the multi-aspect oriented query summarization into 2 phases: information gathering and summary generation. Different from traditional text summarization where a set of documents to be summarized is given as a system input, we propose a ""Composite Query for Summarization"" method, which leverages the search engine to proactively gather related information. In addition to using the search result of the original query, we also composite a set of new queries and submit them to the search engine to",1,ad,True

Our motivations are:",0,,False
"First, the search result of the original query may not contain enough information for all aspects that users care about, because the search engine returns documents only considering whether a document is relevant to the query keywords, rather than its aspects.",0,,False
"Second, for better aspect oriented exploration, the information for different query aspects should be as orthogonal as possible. It is important to distinguish the aspect specific information from the general information about the whole query. By using the composite queries, we could get more specific information for each aspect.",0,,False
"The flexible information gathering also helps for summary generation phase. By comparing the search results of different types of composite queries, query (dependent) aspect words can be identified without complex natural language processing, based on which more specific and informative summaries could be generated,",0,,False

2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
2.1 Search Result Organization,0,,False
"Exploratory search becomes a new frontier in the search domain, which aims to provide additional support for information seeking beyond simple lookup [24]. Recent work has shown that well-organized search results are helpful for information exploration. For example, search result clustering [9, 11, 27], categorizing [1], facet based information exploration [6], representative queries [23] and tag clouds [10] are adopted for search result navigation. Clustering based approaches automatically group similar search result documents together [9, 11, 27]. Search result documents can also be classified into a manually constructed category taxonomy [1]. But the fixed hierarchy often lacks of flexibility to describe various user information needs. Faceted search aims to offer the ability for searchers to filter search results by specifying desired attributes [6]. However, the facets are usually pre-defined for some specific domain so that it is difficult to apply it to web search. Though most of the above methods organize search result documents into various aspects and improve user experience for information exploration, the content are still presented at document level, and users can't get relevant information directly.",1,ad,True
2.2 Document Summarization,0,,False
"Single document summarization techniques have been successfully applied in web search engines (snippet generation) [19, 20]. A span of text gives users a first sight of the topics of a document. For efficiency, sentence extraction strategy is used for generating query dependent summaries [5].",0,,False
"Comparing with single document summarization, multidocument summarization is expected to generate a global picture for a set of documents which is given as input [15, 26]. Recently researchers utilize latent topics for multiple document summarization. For example, subtopics from the narrative of a topic (a description of a topic, which is provided by the DUC summarization track) is used to enhance summarization [17]. Wang uses topic model to extract subtopics and select sentences by topic words [21]. However, the latent topics used in these papers are usually mined unsupervised. As a result, the topics may fit to the data collection, rather than align to user intents.",1,DUC,True

"Our work is based on query aspects but differs from existing work in several points. First, in our framework, query aspects could be mined from any resources but not limited to a set of documents to be summarized. Second, the traditional summarization task treats the documents as a given input to the system. However, in our scenario, we separate the information gathering and summarization generation phases. In this way, we view the whole web as a corpus and could proactively collect more related information for summarization. Third, we aim to generate both specific and informative content for each query aspect. Therefore, users could get relevant information directly.",1,ad,True

"An aspect represents a distinct information need relevant to the original query. Recently, various methods have been proposed for automatically discovering query intents [2, 4, 22, 25]. The NTCIR-9 Intent Task was organized to explore and evaluate the technologies of mining and satisfying different user intents for a vague query [18]. In these work, a query aspect is represented in different ways, such as a set of search queries related to the original query [2, 25], a set of query qualifiers [22] or a single intent string [18]. These definitions are in fact very similar. The main differences are: (1) Whether distinguish the original query and the query qualifier. (2) Whether select an exemplar (label) to represent a set of queries related to the same intent.",0,,False
"Inspired by previous work, we define an aspect as a query",0,,False

In this work, we mainly focus on multi-aspect oriented summary generation and use very simple method to mine query aspects. However, any existing method for mining query aspects could be incorporated.We can also use the services provided by search engines to get approximate query aspects. For example, search engines provide ""query suggestion"" or ""related searches"" features. Figure 2 shows a snipping of the search result from Bing Search page for query ""Saving Private Ryan"", a famous movie. Thus, the aspects could be easily identified using simple rules from related searches. We could also predefine some aspect templates for certain query classes, such as movie, travel, music, people, etc. We leave this as future work.",1,ad,True
4. MULTI-ASPECT ORIENTED QUERY SUMMARIZATION,0,,False
"Now, we suppose the aspects are given and aim to summarize a query according to its different aspects. We expect to generate both specific and informative summary for each aspect instead of a set of documents so that the users could get relevant information directly. First, we explain the meaning of specific and informative by an example. Suppose that for the query ""Saving Private Ryan"", one of the user information needs is to know the ""actors"" of this movie. There are some candidate sentences:",1,ad,True

"All the three sentences contain certain information about the aspect ""actors"". The first one talks about the general information about the query. It is Not specific to the desired aspect. The second sentence focuses on the desired aspect, however, it does not provide relevant information directly, only gives navigational information. We say it is specific but Not informative. The third sentence should be a good candidate which provides direct answers to the desired aspect, i.e., the names of the actors. It is both specific and informative.",0,,False
"As the example shows, the challenges of this task include: (1) Distinguish aspect specific information from general query information. (2) Identify informative content instead of navigational information only. We take the Composite Query for Summarization method to deal with above issue, which consists of 2 phases: information gathering and summary generation. First, we proactively get aspect specific information using composite queries. Then a mixture model is used to model different types of words which present query common information or aspect specific information. Finally, we rank the candidate sentences based on the mixture model and the redundancy in search results for generating summaries.",1,ad,True

"We present a composite query based method for information gathering. Formally, we denote the original query as Q and an aspect as Ak. For example, Q refers to the original query ""Saving Private Ryan"" and Ak refers to one aspect ""actors"". In information gathering phase, we composite a new query by concatenating the original query and the aspect words, denoted as Q + Ak. The composite query is ""Saving Private Ryan actors"". Therefore, we can submit the composite query to the search engine to get top ranked documents. Comparing with the search result of the original query, the search result of the composite query is much more specific for the query aspect. Also, we can submit the aspect Ak itself to the search engine to get information about the aspect which is query independent.",0,,False
"For a query with K aspects, we have a set of composite queries {Q, Q + A1, ..., Q + AK , A1, ..., AK }. We use the top returned documents for each composite query. The search result of Q (denoted as CQ) provides overall information about the query; the search result of Q + Ak (denoted as CQ+Ak ) provides the information about the aspect Ak of the query Q. The search result of Ak (denoted as CAk ) provides information about the aspect itself which is query independent. The idea of using composite queries is straightforward and the benefits are two folded: (1) We collect more aspect related data which may be not contained in original query's search result. (2) The search engine helps us roughly classify information according to the query aspects.",0,,False

However, all systems still generate less specific and informative sentences than navigational sentences. This indicates the task is really challenging.",1,TREC,True
"Q-Composite performs better than Ling-2008. The reasons may include: (1) Ling-2008 estimates the aspect model on the search result of the original query. There may be not enough information covering all query aspects as shown in section 5.5.1. Therefore, for difficult aspects, it is unable to estimate accurate models. (2) In the search result of the original query, information related to multiple aspects often mixes together. It increases the difficulty to estimate discriminative aspect models. Therefore, it is more difficult to provide specific information for desired aspect. (3) The search result is so noisy that there are many navigational sentences. For example, sentences containing ""actors"" may also contain words like ""cast"", ""list"" and ""actress"". These words are very easy to have higher weights in aspect models and the sentences are ranked high as well. However, such sentences may only contain navigational information but can't provide direct information. Another reason affecting the performance of Ling-2008 may be that we did not implement the variation with regularization, which is more complex but reported having better performance than the basic algorithm with Dirichlet model priors. In contrast, by using composite query based method, we are able to get more aspect specific information and roughly classify the information.

Our method could get more aspect specific information by comparing the search results of multiple composite queries. Highlighting query dependent aspect words also helps select more informative sentences. Snippet generates less irrelevant sentences.

"In this paper, we presented a multi-aspect oriented query summarization task. This task aims to summarize a query from multiple aspects which are aligned to user intents. Ideally, the users could get relevant information satisfying their information needs directly. Specifically, we formulated the task into 2 main phases: information gathering and summary generation. In the information gathering phase, we proposed a composite query based strategy, which proactively gets information based on the search engine. This strategy differs from traditional search result organization and text summarization, where the set of documents to be deal with is seen as a given system input. In the summary generation phase, we took into consideration the specificity, informativeness and redundancy for sentence selection. We conducted experiments on 2 data sets. Both automatic evaluation and manually judgements were explored. We emphasized that the quality of aspect oriented summaries should be evaluated according to their specificity and informativeness. The experimental results showed that by using composite queries, much more aspect relevant information could be got and our method outperformed 2 baselines for generating informative summaries.",1,ad,True
"The proposed method attempts to directly provide well organized and relevant information to users, as opposed to relevant documents. We have several possible directions of future work. First, in this paper we assume the query aspects are given. We would examine the system performance when using automatically mined query aspects. Second, more advanced methods could be exploited to integrate multiple sources of information related to a query for generating more informative summaries.

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"People are seldom aware that their search queries frequently mismatch a majority of the relevant documents. This may not be a big problem for topics with a large and diverse set of relevant documents, but would largely increase the chance of search failure for less popular search needs. We aim to address the mismatch problem by developing accurate and simple queries that require minimal effort to construct. This is achieved by targeting retrieval interventions at the query terms that are likely to mismatch relevant documents. For a given topic, the proportion of relevant documents that do not contain a term measures the probability for the term to mismatch relevant documents, or the term mismatch probability. Recent research demonstrates that this probability can be estimated reliably prior to retrieval. Typically, it is used in probabilistic retrieval models to provide query dependent term weights. This paper develops a new use: Automatic diagnosis of term mismatch. A search engine can use the diagnosis to suggest manual query reformulation, guide interactive query expansion, guide automatic query expansion, or motivate other responses. The research described here uses the diagnosis to guide interactive query expansion, and create Boolean conjunctive normal form (CNF) structured queries that selectively expand `problem' query terms while leaving the rest of the query untouched. Experiments with TREC Ad-hoc and Legal Track datasets demonstrate that with high quality manual expansion, this diagnostic approach can reduce user effort by 33%, and produce simple and effective structured queries that surpass their bag of word counterparts.",1,ad,True

"Vocabulary mismatch between queries and documents is known to be important for full-text search. Recent research formally defined the term mismatch probability, and showed that on average a query term mismatches (fails to appear in) 40% to 50% of the documents relevant to the query [32].

"whole query can degrade very quickly. Even when search engines do not require all query terms to appear in result documents, including a query term that is likely to mismatch relevant documents can still cause the mismatch problem: The retrieval model will penalize the relevant documents that do not contain the term, and at the same time favor documents (false positives) that happen to contain the term but are irrelevant. Since the number of false positives is typically much larger than the number of relevant documents for a topic [8], these false positives can appear throughout the rank list, burying the true relevant results.",1,ad,True
"This work is concerned with the term mismatch problem, a long standing problem in retrieval. What's new here is the term level diagnosis and intervention. We use automatic predictions of the term mismatch probability [32] to proactively diagnose each query term, and to guide further interventions to directly address the problem terms. Compared to prior approaches, which typically handle the query as a whole, the targeted intervention in this work generates simple yet effective queries.",1,ad,True
"Query expansion is one of the most common methods to solve mismatch. We use the automatic term mismatch diagnosis to guide query expansion. Other forms of intervention, e.g. term removal or substitution, can also solve certain cases of mismatch, but they are not the focus of this work. We show that proper diagnosis can save expansion effort by 33%, while achieving near optimal performance.",1,Query,True
"We generate structured expansion queries of Boolean conjunctive normal form (CNF) -- a conjunction of disjunctions where each disjunction typically contains a query term and its synonyms. Carefully created CNF queries are highly effective. They can limit the effects of the expansion terms to their corresponding query term, so that while fixing the mismatched terms, the expansion query is still faithful to the semantics of the original query. We show that CNF expansion leads to more stable retrieval across different levels of expansion, minimizing problems such as topic drift even with skewed expansion of part of the query. It outperforms bag of word expansion given the same set of high quality expansion terms.",1,ad,True

2.1 Term mismatch and automatic diagnosis,0,,False
"Furnas et al. [7] were probably the first to study vocabulary mismatch quantitatively, by measuring how people name the same concept/activity differently. They showed that on average 80-90% of the times, two people will name the same item differently. The best term only covers about 15-35% of all the occurrences of the item, and the 3 best terms together only cover 37-67% of the cases. Even with 15 aliases, only 60-80% coverage is achieved.

"Zhao and Callan [32] formally defined the term mismatch probability to be P | , the likelihood that term t does not appear in a document d, given that d is relevant to the topic (d R), or equivalently, the proportion of relevant documents that do not contain term t. Furnas et al. [7]'s definition of vocabulary mismatch is query independent, and can be reduced to an average case of Zhao and Callan [32]'s query dependent definition.",0,,False
"The complement of term mismatch is the term recall probability: P(t | R). A low P(t | R) means term t tends not to appear in the documents relevant to the topic. This query dependent probability P(t | R) is not new in retrieval research. It is known to be part of the Binary Independence Model (BIM) [23], as part of the optimal term weight. Accurate estimation of P(t | R) requires knowledge of R -- the relevant set of a topic, which defeats the purpose of retrieval, and P(t | R) was thought to be difficult to estimate.",0,,False
"Recent research showed that P(t | R) can be reliably predicted without using relevance information of the test topics [8,20,32]. Zhao and Callan [32] achieved the best predictions from being the first to design and use query dependent features for prediction, features such as term centrality, replaceability and abstractness.",0,,False
"Previously, P(t | R) predictions were used to adjust query term weights of inverse document frequency (idf)-based retrieval models such as Okapi BM25 and statistical language models. Term weighting is not a new technique in retrieval research, neither is predicting term weights.",1,ad,True
"Our work is a significant departure from the prior research that predicted P(t | R). We apply the P(t | R) predictions in a completely new way, to automatically diagnose term mismatch problems and inform further interventions.",0,,False
2.2 CNF structured expansion,0,,False
"Query expansion is one of the most common ways to solve mismatch. In recent years, the research community has focused on expansion of the whole query, for example using pseudo relevance feedback [17]. This form of expansion is simple to manage and effective. It also allows introduction of expansion terms that are related to the query as a whole, even if their relationship to any specific original query term is tenuous.",1,Query,True
"When people search for information, they typically develop queries in Boolean conjunctive normal form (CNF). CNF queries are used by librarians [16,12], lawyers [2,26] and other expert searchers [4,13,21]. Each conjunct represents a high-level concept, and each disjunct represents alternate forms of the concept. Query expansion is accomplished by adding disjuncts that cover as many ways of expressing the concept as possible.",1,Query,True

(sales OR sell OR sold) AND (tobacco OR cigar OR cigarettes) AND (children OR child OR teen OR juvenile OR kid OR adolescent),1,ad,True
"CNF queries ensure precision by specifying a set of concepts that must appear (AND), and improve recall by expanding alternative forms of each concept. Compared to LSA or bag of word expansion, CNF queries offer control over what query terms to expand (the query term dimension) and what expansion terms to use for a query term (the expansion dimension).",0,,False
"However, these two dimensions of flexibility also make automatic formulation of CNF queries computationally",0,,False
"challenging, and makes manual creation of CNF queries tedious. The few experiments demonstrating effective CNF expansion either used manually created queries or only worked for a special task. Hearst [13] and Mitra et al. [21] used ranked Boolean retrieval on manual CNF queries. Zhao and Callan [31] automatically created CNF queries for the question answering task, based on the semantic structure of the question.",0,,False
"Along the two directions of term diagnosis and expansion, prior research has focused on identifying synonyms of query terms, i.e. the expansion dimension. Google has patents [15] using query logs to identify possible synonyms for query terms in the context of the query. Jones and colleagues [14] also extracted synonyms of query terms from query logs. They called it query substitutions. Wang and Zhai [28] mined effective query reformulations from query logs. Dang and Croft [5] did the same with TREC Web collections. Xue, Croft and Smith [30] weighted and combined automatic whole-query reformulations, similar to the way alternative structured queries were combined in [31]. If more extensive expansions were used, the more compact CNF expansion would be a reasonable next step. Because of reasons such as suboptimal quality of expansions or insufficient number of topics for evaluation, prior research on ad hoc retrieval has not seen automatic CNF expansion to outperform keyword retrieval. Perhaps the only exception is the related problem of context sensitive stemming [27,22,3], where expansion terms are just morphological variants of the query terms, which are easier to identify and more accurate (less likely to introduce false positives).",1,TREC,True
"Such prior work tried to expand any query term, and did not exploit the term diagnosis dimension, thus they essentially expanded the query terms whose synonyms are easy to find.",0,,False
"This work focuses on selectively expanding the query terms that really need expansion, a less well studied dimension. Exploiting this diagnosis dimension can guide further retrieval interventions such as automatic query reformulation or user interaction to the areas of the query that need help, leading to potentially more effective retrieval interventions. It also reduces the complexity of formulating CNF queries, manually or automatically. The prior research on synonym extraction is orthogonal to this work, and can be applied with term diagnosis in a real-world search system.",1,ad,True
2.3 Simulated interactive expansions,0,,False
"Our diagnostic intervention framework is general and can be applied to both automatic and manual expansions. However, our experiments are still constrained by the availability of effective intervention methods. That is why we use manual CNF expansion, which is highly effective. To avoid using the expensive and less controllable online user studies, we use existing user-created CNF queries to simulate online diagnostic expansion interactions.",0,,False
"Simulations of user interactions are not new in interactive retrieval experiments. Harman [9] simulated relevance feedback experiments by using relevance judgements of the top 10 results, and evaluated feedback retrieval on the rest of the results. White et al. [29] also used relevance judgements and assumed several user browsing strategies to simulate users' interactions with the search interface. The interaction simulations were used as user feedback to select expansion terms. Similarly, Lin and Smucker [18] assumed a set of strategies that define how the user browses the search results, to simulate and evaluate a result browsing interface using known relevance judgements.",0,,False

"We hope to answer the following questions. Suppose the user is willing to invest some extra time for each query, how much effort is needed to improve the initial query (in expansion effort, how many query terms need to be expanded, and how many expansion terms per query term are needed)? When is the best performance achieved? Can we direct the user to a subset of the query terms so that less effort is needed to achieve a near optimal performance? What's an effective criterion for term diagnosis?",0,,False
3.1 Diagnostic intervention framework,0,,False
"The diagnostic intervention framework is designed as follows. The user issues an initial keyword query. Given the query, the system selects a subset of the query terms and asks the user to fix (e.g. expand) them. The performance after user intervention is used to compare the different diagnosis strategies.",0,,False
"This evaluation framework needs to control two dimensions, the diagnosis dimension (selecting the set of problem query terms) and the intervention dimension (determining the amount of intervention for each selected term). Diagnosis of terms with mismatch problems can be achieved using criteria such as low predicted P(t | R) or high idf. The intervention dimension when implemented as query expansion can be controlled by asking the user to provide a certain number of expansion terms.",0,,False
3.2 Query term diagnosis methods,1,Query,True
"We consider two term diagnosis methods, idf based term diagnosis and predicted P(t | R) based diagnosis.",0,,False
"The idf based diagnosis selects the query terms that have the highest idf first. Idf is known to have a correlation with P(t | R) [8] and has been used as a feature for predicting P(t | R) [8,20,32]. A rare term (high idf) usually means a high likelihood of mismatch, while a frequent word (e.g. stopword) would have a high P(t | R).",0,,False
"Diagnosis based on predicted P(t | R) selects the query terms with the lowest predicted P(t | R) first. We use the best known method to predict P(t | R) [32], which was the first to use query dependent features for prediction. It used top ranked documents from an initial retrieval to automatically extract query dependent synonyms. These synonyms were used to create some of the effective query dependent features, e.g. how often synonyms of a query term appear in top ranked documents from the initial retrieval, and how often such synonyms appear in place of the original query term in collection documents. Section 4 describes implementation details.",0,,False
3.3 Possible confounding factors,0,,False
"To exactly follow this ideal framework, for each query, many user interaction experiments are needed ­ one experiment for each",0,,False
"possible diagnostic intervention setup, preferably, one user per setup. Many factors need to be controlled, such as users' prior knowledge of the topic, the quality of the manual interventions, users' interaction time and interaction method (whether retrieval results are examined), so that the final retrieval performance will reflect the effect of the diagnostic component instead of random variation in the experiment setup. These factors are difficult to eliminate even with hundreds of experiments per topic. We show how simulations may help in the section below.",1,ad,True
4. EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY,0,,False
"In this section, we design the retrieval experiments to evaluate diagnostic interventions. We explain how user simulations may be an appropriate substitute for costly online experiments with human subjects. We explain how to design the diagnostic intervention experiment so that it measures the effects of term diagnosis, minimizing effects from confounding factors such as the quality of the post-diagnosis interventions. We examine the datasets used for this simulation, in particular how well the manual CNF queries fit the simulation assumptions. We also describe the whole evaluation procedure, including the implementation of the mismatch diagnosis methods which (together with the user intervention) produce the post-intervention queries, the retrieval model behind query execution, and the evaluation metrics used to measure retrieval effectiveness.",0,,False
"We focus on interactive expansion as the intervention method, using existing CNF queries to simulate interactive expansion. This is due to both the effectiveness of query expansion to solve mismatch and the lack of user data for other types of interventions.",0,,False
4.1 Simulated user interactions,0,,False
"As explained in Section 3.3, a large number of experiments and users are needed to evaluate diagnostic expansion using online user studies. To avoid this, we use offline automatic simulations, sketched in Figure 1. There are three players in the simulation, the user, the diagnostic expansion retrieval system and the simulation based evaluation system. Before evaluation, the user creates fully expanded CNF queries. These manually created CNF queries are used by the evaluation system to simulate selective expansions, and are accessible to the diagnostic retrieval system only through the simulation system. During evaluation, the simulation system first extracts a basic no-expansion keyword query from the CNF query, feeding the keyword query to the diagnosis system. The diagnostic expansion system automatically diagnoses which keywords are more problematic. Then, the simulation system takes the top several problem terms, and extracts a certain number of expansion terms for each selected query term from its corresponding conjunct in the manual CNF query. This step simulates a user expanding the selected query terms. The number of problem query terms to expand and the number of expansion terms to include are controlled by the simulation system, which will evaluate retrieval at five different selection levels and five different expansion levels. Finally, given",0,,False
517,0,,False
"these expansion terms for each selected query term, the diagnostic expansion system forms an expansion query and does retrieval.",0,,False
"For example, based on the CNF query in Section 2.2, the diagnosis method is given the keyword query sales tobacco children. It may see children as more problematic than the other terms, then a full expansion of this problem term would produce the query sales AND tobacco AND (children OR child OR teen OR juvenile OR kid OR adolescent), whose retrieval performance is evaluated as the end result of diagnostic expansion. If the evaluation system selects two query terms sales and children for expansion, with a maximum of one expansion term each, the final query would be (sales OR sell) AND tobacco AND (children OR child). These diagnostic expansion queries are partial expansions simulated using the fully expanded queries created by real users.",1,ad,True
"Our simulation allows us to answer the same set of questions about the diagnostic expansion system which we hope to answer through online user interactions, and requires simpler experiments. In our simulations, the same set of expansion terms is always used for a given query term, those from its corresponding CNF conjunct. Doing so minimizes the variation from the expansion terms as we measure the effects of the diagnosis component. The order in which expansion terms are added for a query term is also fixed, in the same order as they appear in the CNF conjunct. This way, we can tweak the level of expansion by gradually including more expansion terms from the lists of expansion terms, and answer how much expansion is needed for optimal performance.",1,ad,True
"Our simulation makes three assumptions about the user expansion process. We examine them below. Expansion term independence assumption: Expansion terms from fully expanded queries are held back from the query to simulate the selective and partial expansion of query terms. This simulation is based on the assumption that the user (a random process that generates expansion terms) will produce the same set of expansion terms for a query term whenever asked to expand any subset of the query terms. Equivalently, given the topic, the expansion process for one query term does not depend on the expansion of other query terms. In reality, a human user focusing on a subset of the query terms can typically achieve higher quality expansion. Thus, selective expansion may actually do better than the reported performance from the simulations. Expansion term sequence assumption: Controlling to include only the first few expansion terms of a query term simulates and measures a user's expansion effort for that query term. It is assumed that the user would come up with the same sequence of expansion terms for each query term, no matter whether the user is asked to expand a subset or all of the query terms. A downside of this simulation is that we do not know exactly how much time and effort the user has spent on each expansion term. CNF keyword-query induction assumption: Instead of actually asking users to expand their initial queries, preexisting fully expanded CNF style queries are used to infer the original keyword query and to simulate the expansion process. For example, given the CNF query in Section 2.2, the original keyword query is assumed to be (sales tobacco children). This simulation assumes that the original keyword query can be reconstructed from the manual CNF query, which could be missing some original query terms (of and to in the example) or introduce new terms into the original keyword query. However, as long as we use highly effective CNF queries, it is safe to use the CNF induced keyword queries as the no-expansion baseline.",1,ad,True
"We also made an effort to ensure that our `reverse-engineered' keyword query is faithful to the vocabulary of the original query. Given the TREC official topic description of a topic, we try to use",1,ad,True
"the first term from each conjunct that appears in this description to reconstruct the keyword query. For conjuncts that do not have description terms, the first term in the conjunct is used.",0,,False
"For example, the topic described as sales of tobacco to children, with CNF query (sales OR sell OR sold) AND (tobacco OR cigar OR cigarettes) AND (children OR child OR teen OR juvenile OR kid OR adolescent), would have (sales tobacco children) as the unexpanded keyword query. If the description were sell tobacco to children, the keyword query would be instead (sell tobacco children), even when sales appears first in its conjunct.",1,ad,True
4.2 Effects of confounding factors,0,,False
Using user simulations instead of real users can eliminate confounding factors such as the user's prior knowledge of the topic and other details of the user interaction process.,1,ad,True
"This work tests the hypothesis that term diagnosis can effectively guide query expansion. However, two factors directly determine the end performance of diagnostic expansion, 1) the effectiveness of term diagnosis, and 2) the benefit from expansion.",0,,False
"Since our focus is on diagnosis, not query expansion, one of the most important confounding factors is the quality of the expansion terms, which we leave out of the evaluation by using a fixed set of high quality expansion terms from manual CNF queries to simulate an expert user doing manual expansion.",0,,False
"Automatic query expansion is more desirable in a deployed system, but the uncertain quality of the expansion terms can confuse the evaluation. Thus, it is not considered in this paper.",0,,False

Four different datasets have been used, those from TREC 2006 and 2007 Legal tracks, and those from TREC 3 and 4 Ad hoc tracks.

We have tried some basic variations of the language model ranked Boolean model. Our pilot study shows that for our datasets, tiered filtering is sometimes worse than probabilistic Boolean, mostly because of the inferior ranking of the keyword queries. Probabilistic OR (#or) is numerically similar to treating all expansion terms the same as the original term (#syn), and the two methods perform similarly in retrieval.

"The statAP measure [1] is the standard measure for TREC Legal 2007. StatAP is an unbiased statistical estimate of MAP designed to work with sampled pooling. It is unbiased in the sense that if all pooled documents were judged, the MAP value would have been the same as the mean of the estimated statAP. In traditional TREC pooling, the top 50 to top 100 documents from each submitted rank list are pooled, and all pooled documents are judged. In sampled pooling, only a sampled subset of the pool is judged. The idea is to use importance sampling to judge fewer documents while maintaining a reliable estimate of MAP. Highly ranked documents from multiple pooled submissions are more likely to be relevant, and they are sampled more by importance sampling. StatAP takes into account these sampling probabilities of the judged relevant documents, so that during evaluation, a judged relevant document with sampling probability p would be counted as a total of 1/p relevant documents. This is because on average 1/p ­ 1 relevant documents are missed during the sampling procedure, and they are being represented by that one sampled relevant document.",1,AP,True

"However, there are three outliers in the bottom left quadrant, which are not fully explained by our theory. At the bottom left quadrant, predicted P(t | R) does identify the right term with a lower P(t | R), but the retrieval performance is actually worse than that of idf guided expansion.",1,ad,True
"By looking into these three topics, we found that the manual queries for topics 76 and 86 do not have any expansion terms for the query terms selected by P(t | R), while the idf selected terms do have effective expansion terms. All such topics where a query term without expansion terms is selected are annotated with diamond shaped borders in the plot. Topic 55 is because of poor expansion term quality. The P(t | R) method selects the chemical name apatite for expansion, which represent a class of chemicals. The manual expansion terms seem very reasonable, and are just names or chemical formulas of the chemicals belonging to the apatite family. However, the query is really about apatite rocks as they appear in nature, not any specific chemical in the apatite family. Thus, even expansion terms proposed by experts can still sometimes introduce false positives into the rank list, and this problem cannot be easily identified without corpus interaction, e.g. examining the result rank list of documents.",0,,False

"Of the 50 TREC 4 topics, similarly, 4 topics are outliers. In two cases, the P(t | R) selected query terms do not have manual expansion terms. In one topic, P(t | R) prediction did not select the right term, but MAP is higher than idf diagnosis, because the idf method selected a query term with poor expansion terms. In one topic, the retrieval performance does not differ at top ranks, and the idf method only excels after 30 documents.",1,TREC,True

"This analysis also shows the inherent difficulty of evaluating term diagnosis in end-to-end retrieval experiments. Even with high quality manual expansion terms, there is still some variation in the quality of the expansion interventions, which can still interfere with the assessment of the diagnosis component.",0,,False
5.5 Boolean CNF vs. bag of word expansion,0,,False
We compare CNF style expansion with two advanced bag-ofword expansion methods.,1,ad,True
"For a fair comparison with manual CNF expansion, our first bag of word expansion baseline also uses the set of manual expansion terms selected by predicted P(t | R). Expansion terms are then grouped and combined with the original query for retrieval.",0,,False
"To make this baseline strong, both individual expansion terms and the expansion term set can be weighted. The individual expansion terms are weighted with the Relevance Model weights [17] from an initial keyword retrieval, with the parameter (the number of feedback documents) tuned on the training set. Manual expansion terms that do not appear in the feedback documents are still included in the final query, but a minimum weight is used to conform to the relevance model weights. Uniform weighting of the expansion terms was also tried. It is more effective than relevance model weights when expansion is more balanced, i.e. more than 3 query terms are selected for expansion. When combining the expansion terms with the original query, the combination weights are 2-fold cross-validated on the test set.",0,,False
"Table 4 shows the best case of both relevance-model-weight and uniform-weight bag of word expansion. Bag of word expansion performs worse than CNF expansion in almost all the different setups. The best performance is achieved with full expansion of 4 query terms, with a MAP of 0.1038, slightly lower than that of CNF (0.1039 in Table 1), however, the statAP value of 0.0211 is much worse than that of CNF (0.0508, Table 2).",1,MAP,True
"Table 5 shows the best case bag of word expansion results on the TREC 4 Ad hoc dataset. Consistent with the statAP measure on TREC Legal 2007, CNF queries are much better than bag of word expansion. For example, with full expansion of all query terms, CNF expansion (Table 3) gets a MAP of 0.2938, 23% better than 0.2384 of the bag of word expansion with the same expansion terms, significant at p < 0.0025 by the randomization test and weakly significant at p < 0.0676 by the sign test.",1,TREC,True
"Some results of bag of word retrieval at low selection levels, i.e. selecting one query term to expand, perform better than idf guided CNF expansion. But since the bag of word expansion here uses better expansion terms selected by predicted P(t | R), this does not mean that bag of word is sometimes better than CNF expansion.",0,,False
"The second bag of word expansion baseline is the standard Lavrenko Relevance Model itself [17], which uses automatic feedback terms, instead of manual ones, for expansion. Parameters trained on Legal 2006 dataset when applied to Legal 2007 lead to an MAP of 0.0606, statAP of 0.0168, worse than the no expansion baseline. On TREC 4, it gets a MAP of 0.2488, slightly better than 0.2384, the best manual bag of word expansion, but still much worse than CNF (0.2938).",1,ad,True
"In sum, given the same set of high quality expansion terms, CNF expansion works much better than bag of word expansion.",0,,False
6. CONCLUSIONS,0,,False
"We set out with the hypothesis that term mismatch based diagnosis can successfully guide further retrieval intervention to fix `problem' terms and improve retrieval. In this work, we",0,,False
"applied the term mismatch diagnosis to guide interactive query expansion. Simulated interactive query expansion experiments on TREC Ad hoc and Legal track datasets not only confirmed this hypothesis, but also showed that automatically predicted P(t | R) probabilities (the complement of term mismatch) can accurately guide expansion to the terms that need expansion most, and lead to better retrieval than when expanding rare terms first. From the user's point of view, it usually isn't necessary to expand every query term. Guided by predicted P(t | R), expanding two terms is enough for most topics to achieve close-to-top performance, while guided by idf (rareness), three terms need to be expanded. P(t | R) guidance can save user effort by 33%.",1,TREC,True
"In addition to confirming the main hypothesis, experiments also showed that Boolean conjunctive normal form (CNF) expansion outperforms carefully weighted bag of word expansion, given the same set of high quality expansion terms. The unstructured bag of word expansion typically needs balanced expansion of most query terms to achieve a reliable performance.",1,ad,True
"Although the effect from adding more expansion terms to a query term diminishes, for the query terms that do need expansion, the effects of the expansion terms are typically additive, the more the expansion the better the performance. This is consistent with prior observations on vocabulary mismatch, that even after including more than 15 aliases, the effects of mismatch can still be observed, and further expansion may still help [7].",1,ad,True
"For bag of word expansion, including more manual expansion terms also helps, but requires a balanced expansion of most query terms, and is not as effective and stable as CNF expansion.",0,,False
"This work is mostly concerned with automatic diagnosis of problem terms in the query, and presents them to the user for manual expansion. It is still a question whether the diagnosis can help automatic formulation of effective CNF queries. We hope to let the system suggest or select expansion terms, automatically or semi-automatically with minimal user effort. Automatic identification of high quality expansion terms would be useful when the candidate expansion terms may not be of high quality, e.g. expansion terms from result documents, thesaurus or nonexpert users. Poor expansion terms in CNF queries are especially harmful, when they over-generalize the query and introduce false positives throughout the rank list. Tools such as performance prediction methods (e.g. query clarity), may help in such scenarios to detect the adverse effects of the poor expansion terms.",1,ad,True
"In the future, we also hope to diagnose precision related problems as well as mismatch problems. We can then use the diagnosis to guide disambiguation, phrasing or fielded retrieval, as well as term substitution, removal or expansion.",0,,False

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Search queries have evolved beyond keyword queries. Many complex queries such as verbose queries, natural language question queries and document-based queries are widely used in a variety of applications. Processing these complex queries usually requires a series of query operations, which results in multiple sequences of reformulated queries. However, previous query representations, either the ""bag of words"" method or the recently proposed ""query distribution"" method, cannot effectively model these query sequences, since they ignore the relationships between two queries. In this paper, a reformulation tree framework is proposed to organize multiple sequences of reformulated queries as a tree structure, where each path of the tree corresponds to a sequence of reformulated queries. Specifically, a two-level reformulation tree is implemented for verbose queries. This tree effectively combines two query operations, i.e., subset selection and query substitution, within the same framework. Furthermore, a weight estimation approach is proposed to assign weights to each node of the reformulation tree by considering the relationships with other nodes and directly optimizing retrieval performance. Experiments on TREC collections show that this reformulation tree based representation significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.",1,TREC,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Although short keyword queries are still very common in web search, the increasing diversity of search applications and information needs has led to increasing complexity in queries. For example, verbose (or long) queries have become more and more popular in web search. In community-based Q&A, users pose natural language questions as queries. In patent retrieval, the whole document (patent application) is considered as the query. These complex queries help users express their information need naturally and save the effort of picking keywords. However, processing these queries poses a significant challenge for search systems.",0,,False
"Dealing with complex queries usually requires a series of query operations. For example, a typical process of dealing with a verbose query can be described as follows. The system first selects a subset of query words from the original query to remove noisy information. Then, the generated subset query is further modified to handle vocabulary mismatch. Finally, weights are assigned to queries generated at each step. Depending on the application, the above process could become more complicated. For example, in cross-lingual retrieval, the original verbose query needs to be translated into a foreign language query before applying any further operation. The above process will generate multiple sequences of reformulated queries, where each sequence records a way of modifying the original query using several query operations. These reformulation sequences capture the relationships between the reformulated queries. Fig. 1 displays some examples of the reformulation sequences, where the subset query is selected from the original query at the first step of the sequence and the second step further substitutes the subset query.",0,,False
"However, previous query representations cannot model these reformulation sequences well. The ""bag of words"" representation is widely used in information retrieval. Using this representation, the original query is transformed into a set of weighted words. Some extensions to this representation introduce phrases [19] and latent words [14][20].",0,,False

"This representation does not explicitly model a reformulated query, which serves as the basis of the reformulation sequences. An example of the ""bag of words"" representation is shown in Fig. 2 (a). Recently, the ""query distribution"" representation [27] was proposed to transform the original query into a set of reformulated queries. For example, Xue et al [30] represents a verbose query as a set of subset queries. This representation indeed considers a reformulated query as the basic unit, but it fails to capture the relationships between the reformulated queries. Therefore, the sequences of reformulated queries still cannot be modeled using this representation. An example of the ""query distribution"" representation is shown in Fig. 2 (b).",0,,False
"In this paper, a novel query representation is proposed to transform a complex query into a reformulation tree, where the nodes at each level of this tree correspond to the reformulated queries generated using a specific query operation. Using this representation, a reformulation sequence is naturally modeled as a path from the root node to the leaf node. The construction of the reformulation tree simulates the process of applying a series of query operations to the complex query. Furthermore, weight is assigned to each node of the reformulation tree, which indicates the importance of the corresponding reformulated query. The estimation of the weight for a node considers not only the characteristics of this node itself, but also its relationships with other nodes. Different with previous reformulation models that treat retrieval models as independent steps, we estimate the weights on the reformulation tree by directly optimizing the performance of retrieval models, which considers the reformulation model and the retrieval model in a joint view.",0,,False
"Verbose queries, as a typical example of complex queries, have attracted much attention recently. Previous research on verbose queries either weights the query words in the original query [16, 15, 3] or selects the best subset of query words from the original query [12]. Relatively little research considers combining multiple query operations together for improving verbose queries. Therefore, as an implementation of the reformulation tree framework, a two-level tree structure is constructed for verbose queries, where the first level corresponds to the subset query selection operation and the second level corresponds to the query substitution operation. A weight estimation method is also described, which incorporates the relationships between different reformulated queries and directly optimizes the retrieval performance.",1,corpora,True
"Fig. 2 (c) shows an example reformulation tree. The first level of this tree consists of two subset queries extracted from the original query, i.e., ""reductions iraqs foreign debt"" and ""iraqs foreign debt"". At the second level, each subset query is further modified to generate query substitutions. For example, ""iraqs foreign debt"" has been modified to ""iraqs external debt"". Furthermore, weight is assigned to each node of this tree, which measures the importance of each reformulated query. Compared with other representations, the reformulation sequences as shown in Fig. 1 are captured using the reformulation tree.",0,,False

"In this section, we review two types of query representations, ""bag of words"" and ""query distribution"".",0,,False
"The ""bag of words"" representation transforms the original query into a set of terms, either weighted or not. These terms include the words and phrases from the original query and the latent words and phrases extracted from the corpus. For example, the relevance model approach [14] adds latent words to the original query, the sequential dependency model [19] detects the phrase structure, and the latent concept expansion model [20] uses proximity features and latent words. This type of representation does not consider how to use words and phrases to form actual reformulated queries. In other words, a reformulated query is not explicitly modeled in this representation.",1,ad,True
"The ""query distribution"" representation transforms the original query into a set of reformulated queries, where each query is assigned a probability. This probability helps measure the importance of the query. For example, Xue et al [30] represented a verbose query as a distribution of subset queries and a modified Conditional Random Field is proposed to estimate the probability for each subset query. This type of representation indeed considers the reformulated query as the basic unit, but it assumes independence between the reformulated queries. When multiple query operations are applied, this independence assumption usually does not hold.",0,,False

Mei et al [17] presented a general framework to model search sequences, where a search sequence is represented as a nested sequence of search objects. The above work focuses on short keyword queries and uses query logs to capture the relationships between the queries submitted within the same search session.

"We now discuss the efficiency of using the reformulation tree model for retrieval. The online cost of this model comes from three aspects, i.e. reformulated query generation, query feature extraction, and retrieval.",0,,False
"The efficiency of the reformulated query generation depends on the reformulation operations involved. For example, generating the subset queries is very efficient. In contrast, generating query substitutions using the passage analysis is more time consuming, since it needs to analyze a lot of passages.",0,,False
"The efficiency of the query feature extraction also depends on the query features used. Some query features are expensive such as query clarity, while some features are relatively cheap such as the frequency in query logs.",0,,False
"Both of these steps can be optimized if large scale query logs are available. We can limit the reformulated queries to those appearing in query logs. In this way, instead of generating queries, we simply search the query logs, which can be efficiently implemented using the index. Also, all query features can be precomputed, which speeds up the query feature extraction.",1,ad,True
"In terms of the efficiency of retrieval, Eq. 1 shows that the retrieval score of each reformulated query (sc(qr, D)) is required. At first glance, this appears to be inefficient, since we need to run multiple queries. However, this can be easily optimized. Eq. 7 shows that sc(qr, D) consists of the scores of the words and bigrams in qr. Since all the reformulated queries in the reformulation tree are generated from the same original query, they share many words and bigrams. Thus, the scores of these words and bigrams can be reused by different reformulated queries. For example, the words and bigrams in the subset queries all come from the original query. Thus, we only need to calculate the scores for every word and bigram in the original query and then reuse these scores for each subset query. Further, although query substitutions may introduce new words and bigrams, the number of these new words and bigrams is limited. For example, Table 7 shows that query substitutions generated",0,,False

"Complex queries pose a new challenge to search systems. In order to combine different query operations and model the relationships between the reformulated queries, a new query representation is proposed in this paper, where the original query is transformed into a reformulation tree. A specific implementation is described for verbose queries, which combines subset query selection and query substitution within a principled framework. In the future, this query representation will be applied to other search tasks involving complex queries such as the cross-lingual retrieval and diversifying the search results.",0,,False

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Rocchio's relevance feedback model is a classic query expansion method and it has been shown to be effective in boosting information retrieval performance. The selection of expansion terms in this method, however, does not take into account the relationship between the candidate terms and the query terms (e.g., term proximity). Intuitively, the proximity between candidate expansion terms and query terms can be exploited in the process of query expansion, since terms closer to query terms are more likely to be related to the query topic.",0,,False
"In this paper, we study how to incorporate proximity information into the Rocchio's model, and propose a proximitybased Rocchio's model, called PRoc, with three variants. In our PRoc models, a new concept (proximity-based term frequency, ptf ) is introduced to model the proximity information in the pseudo relevant documents, which is then used in three kinds of proximity measures. Experimental results on TREC collections show that our proposed PRoc models are effective and generally superior to the state-of-the-art relevance feedback models with optimal parameters. A direct comparison with positional relevance model (PRM) on the GOV2 collection also indicates our proposed model is at least competitive to the most recent progress.",1,corpora,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) via query expansion (QE) is an effective technique for boosting the overall performance in Information Retrieval (IR). It assumes that topranked documents in the first-pass retrieval are relevant, and then used as feedback documents in order to refine the representation of original queries by adding potentially related terms. Although PRF has been shown to be effective in improving IR performance [4, 6, 9, 13, 23, 26, 28, 30, 36, 37, 40, 42] in a number of IR tasks, traditional PRF can also fail in some cases. For example, when some of the feedback documents have several incoherent topics, terms in the irrelevant contents are likely to misguide the feedback models by importing noisy terms into the queries. This could influence the retrieval performance in a negative way. It is partially because the query itself was ignored in the process of expansion term selection. To be more specific, the term associations between candidate terms and the query terms have been ignored in traditional PRF models.",1,ad,True
"Term proximity is an effective measure for term associations, which has been studied extensively in the past few years. Most of these studies focus on the term proximity within the original query and adapt this in ranking documents [3, 5, 8, 10, 15, 24, 31, 33]. Various methods of integrating proximity information into a retrieval process are introduced in these papers, and it has proven to be useful in discriminating between the relevant and non-relevant documents.",1,ad,True
"In the field of PRF, based on the assumption that terms closer to the query terms are more likely to be relevant to the query topic, there are several studies which investigated how to give more weight to these terms in the process of pseudo relevance feedback. For example, to this end, Vechtomova et al. [34] imported a distance factor which combined with Mutual Information (MI) for selecting query expansion terms. Lv et al. [16] proposed a positional relevance model (PRM) by using position and proximity information to solve this problem and obtain significant performance.",0,,False
"However, as far as we are aware, there is little work done on incorporating proximity information into the traditional Rocchio's feedback model. Although the Rocchio's model has been introduced in the information retrieval field for many years, it is still effective in obtaining relevant documents. According to [41], ""BM25 [27] term weighting coupled with Rocchio feedback remains a strong baseline which is at least as competitive as any language modeling approach for many tasks."" This observation is also supported in our preliminary experiments of this paper. Therefore, it",1,corpora,True
535,0,,False
is promising to make an extension of the Rocchio's model to take into account the proximity information.,0,,False
"In addition, it is unknown how to tackle the challenge of modeling the traditional statistics of expansion terms and the relationship between expansion terms and the query terms in a unified framework. In this paper, we propose a proximity-based feedback model based on the traditional Rocchio's model, called PRoc. Unlike the PRM model, we focus on the proximity of terms rather than the positional information. In our method, we estimate the weights of candidate expansion terms by taking their distance from query terms into account. Specifically, if a term is far away from the query terms in the feedback documents, it is proposed to be punished by discounting its weight because it is likely to be irrelevant to the query topic.",1,ad,True
"The main contribution of this paper is as follows. First, we study how to adapt the traditional Rocchio's model [28] for proximity information, and propose a proximity-based feedback model, called PRoc, in which the traditional statistics of expansion terms and the proximity relationship between expansion terms and the query terms are taken into account. Second, we propose to use three proximity measures. Unlike previous methods, the importance of query terms has been taken into account to measure the proximity information by proposing a new concept, namely proximity-based term frequency. Finally, extensive experiments on standard TREC collections have been conducted to evaluate our proposed feedback model from different aspects. We compare our proposed feedback model with strong feedback baselines. Our model can achieve significantly better performance over RM3 and the classic Rocchios' model.",1,ad,True
"The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we review the related work. In Section 3, three methods for measuring the proximity and our proposed model, PRoc, are presented in details. In Section 4, we introduce the settings of the experiments. In Section 5, the experimental results are presented and discussed. A direct comparison is made to compare PRoc with the most recent work PRM. Finally, we conclude our work with a brief conclusion and future research directions in Section 6.",1,ad,True

2.1 Pseudo Relevance Feedback,0,,False
"In information retrieval, PRF via query expansion is referred to as the techniques, algorithms or methodologies that reformulate the original query by adding new terms into the query, in order to achieve a better retrieval performance. There are a large number of studies on the topic of PRF. Here we mainly review the work about PRF which is the most related to our research.",1,ad,True
"A classical relevance feedback technique was proposed by Rocchio in 1971 for the Smart retrieval system [28]. It is a framework for implementing (pseudo) relevance feedback via improving the query representation, in which a set of documents are utilized as the feedback information. Unique terms in this set are ranked in descending order of their TFIDF weights. In the following decades, many other relevance feedback techniques and algorithms were developed, mostly derived under Rocchio's framework. For example, a popular and successful automatic PRF algorithm was proposed by [26] in the Okapi system; Amati et al. [2] proposed a query expansion algorithm in his divergence from",1,ad,True
"randomness (DFR) retrieval framework. In addition, with the development of language model [21] in IR, a number of techniques (e.g. [13, 32, 42]) have been developed to fit in the language modeling framework. In addition, Robertson [25] proposed a theoretical feedback model that supports the assumption by using of the difference of term distributions to select and re-weight the expansion terms.",1,ad,True
"For PRF in the language modeling framework, we always exploit feedback information (e.g., the top-ranked documents set, F ,"" D1, D2, . . . , D|F |), in order to re-estimate a more accurate query language model. For example, the model based feedback approach [42] is not only theoretically sound, but also performs well empirically. The essence of model based feedback is to update the probability of a term in the query language model by making use of the feedback information. Much like model-based feedback, relevance models [13] also estimate an improved query model. The difference between the two approaches is that relevance models do not explicitly model the relevant or pseudo-relevant document. Instead, they model a more generalized notion of relevance [18]. Lv et al. [14] have conducted a comparable study of five representative state-of-the-art methods for estimating improved query language models in ad hoc information retrieval, including RM3 (a variant of the relevance language model), RM4, DMM, SMM (a variant of modelbased feedback approach), and RMM [13, 32, 42]. They found that SMM and RM3 are the most effective in their experiments, and RM3 is more robust to the setting of feedback parameters.""",1,ad,True

"Term proximity is the co-occurrences of terms within a specified distance. Particularly, the distance is the number of intermediate terms in a document. Plenty of work has been done to integrate term proximity into both probabilistic and language models. Keen [10, 11] firstly attempted to import term proximity in the Boolean retrieval model by introducing a ""NEAR"" operator. Buttcher et al. [3] proposed an integration of term proximity scoring into Okapi BM25 and obtain improvements on several collections. Rasolofo et al. [24] added additional weight to the top documents which contain query term pairs appearing in a window through a two-phase process, but the improvement is somewhat marginal. Song et al. [31] presented a new perspective on term proximity. Query terms are grouped into phrases, and the contribution of a term is determined by how many query terms appear in the context phrases. In order to make it clear that how we could model proximity and incorporate a proximity measure, Tao et al. [33] systemically studied five proximity measures and investigated how they perform in the KL-divergence retrieval model and the Okapi BM25 retrieval model. Under the language modeling framework, Zhao et al. [45] used a query term's proximate centrality as a hyper parameter in the Dirichlet language model. Lv et al. [15] integrated the positional and proximity information into the language model by a different way. They defined a positional language model at each position in documents by create virtual documents based on term probation.",1,ad,True

"ity information of query terms to avoid documents which contain scattered query terms. This kind of documents should be punished because they are very likely to be irrelevant. For example, a document contains both ""Japan"" and ""Earthquake"" is possible to be irrelevant to the topic ""Earthquake in Japan"" if these two terms are not close in the context. It could be biased to only ""Earthquake"" and mention some technologies in ""Japan"" about ""Earthquake"". Term proximity is effective to discriminate against these types of documents. Although there have been plenty of efforts in integrating proximity heuristic into existing retrieval models, research work about how to utilize this information for pseudo relevance feedback is still limited. Vechtomova et al. [34] combined several distance factors with Mutual Information for selecting query expansion terms from windows or passages surrounding query term occurrences. However, marginal improvements were observed in the experiments. Lv et al. [16] presented two methods to estimate the joint probability of a term w with the query Q at every position in each feedback document. This is an extension of the state-of-the-art relevance model [13], and significant improvements were obtained on two collections. Besides the work presented [16, 34], it is difficult to find other systematical work about formally modeling term proximity heuristic in the context of pseudo feedback, especially in the classic Rocchio's model.",0,,False
"In this paper, we propose PRoc models which integrates the proximity information of terms into the traditional Rocchio's framework. Three kinds of proximity measures are introduced to estimate relevance and importance of the candidate terms. In order to integrate term proximity into the Rocchio's model, we re-interpret the definition of term frequency and introduce a new concept, proximity term frequency. Unlike in [34], we conduct our study on a mature feedback model which has proven to be effective. Instead, the work of Vechtomova et al. was based on the Mutual Information which failed to perform as well as the traditional feedback model. In contrast to the work in [16], we try to employ proximity heuristic in a formalistic framework which extensively differs from the language modeling framework. Indeed, we do not concern ourselves with the position of each candidate term as in [16]. Meanwhile, to confirm the effectiveness of our model, we compare the performance of PRoc with that of PRM in Section 5. The experimental results show that our proposed PRoc is at least competitive to the most recent work, PRM.",1,ad,True

"Traditionally, candidate terms are ranked by their weights in the feedback documents, and the weights are affected by term frequencies in these documents extensively. However, the normal term frequency cannot capture the characteristic that whether a candidate term occurs near or far away from the query, such that the candidate term may not be relevant to the query topic. In other words, if the occurrence of a term is far away from the query terms, it should not be counted in the effective term frequency because this term is very likely to be irrelevant to the query topic. Thus, we propose a new concept, proximity term frequency (ptf ), which models the frequency of a term as well as the semantics to the query in terms of proximity. In order to adapt the proximity information, we re-interpret the definition of term frequency by proposing three kinds of proximity measures: window-based method, kernel-based method and the hyperspace analogue to language method. The main research challenge now we are facing is how to evaluate ptf. In the following subsections, we introduce three measures to compute the ptf . Meanwhile, the importance of query terms is also taken into account. A very frequent query term is likely to be close to many candidate terms, which makes it difficult to distinguish the related feedback terms. Inverse document frequency (idf ) of query terms is integrated to calculate ptf.",1,ad,True

"The basic idea of the window-based n-gram counting method is to segment the document into a list of sliding windows, with each window having a fixed window size wSize. If a document has a length of l, and the window size is set to wSize, the document is then segmented into l-wSize sliding windows, where each window contains wSize consecutive tokens. For example, if a document has four tokens A, B, C, and D, and the window size is 3, there are two windows in this document, namely A, B, C and B, C, D. The n-gram frequency is then defined as the number of windows in which all n-gram terms co-occur. There could be two variants of the n-gram models, namely the ordered and unordered ngram models. The ordered n-gram model takes the order of occurrences of the n-gram terms into account. For the same n-gram terms, the n-grams in which the composing n-gram terms appear in different orders are considered as different n-grams. In contrast, the unordered model ignores the order of occurrences of the n-gram terms. Actually, only a rough distance between terms is considered in this measure.

"The n-gram counting method has the advantage of being straight-forward, and can be easily deployed in practice. It does not take the actual distance between query terms into account directly, and any n-gram terms appear together within a window is counted as one occurrence of the n-gram. If a term is very close to a query term, its co-occurrence count with the query term will be more than that of a term far away from this query term in the sliding windows.

"In our proposed PRoc models, there are two important parameters: (1)  in the feedback models controlling how much we rely on the original query and the feedback information and (2) window size parameter wSize in the calculation of the proximity-based frequency. In our preliminary experiments, we observed that the influence of  is similar to that in [38], which investigated this parameter thoroughly. Since we mainly focus on the study of proximity evidence, detailed discussion about  will not be made in this paper.",1,ad,True
"wSize is a key parameter for most proximity measures because it determines the distance in which terms are considered to be related. Thus, how to find an appropriate window size is very important for adapting the proximity measures. In this section, we attempt to discover some useful evidence for obtaining optimal wSize values. Particularly,  in PRoc2 is also interpreted as the window size.",1,ad,True
"From Figure 1 to 4, we show how the performance of our PRoc models changes with wSize on different collections. We investigate a large range of wSize from 10 to 1500, and the numbers of expansion terms are 10, 20, 30 and 50. Generally, the values of wSize affect the performance of all the PRoc models extensively. In the second subfigure of Figure 4, the best MAP is 0.3205 when number of expansion terms is 50, and it falls to 0.2286 when wSize is 1500. Almost 30% of performance is lost in this case.",1,MAP,True
"For PRoc1, PRoc2 and PRoc3, although they are based on different measures, their curves fluctuate similarly on the same collection with different numbers of expansion terms. In contrast, the curves of each PRoc model are various extensively on different collections. This demonstrates that the influence of wSize is collection-based. However, the best wSize values for PRoc models are not the same, not even close to each other. For example, on the disk4&5 collection, optimal wSize values for PRoc1 are 80, 50, 100 and 80 over 10, 20, 30 and 50 expansion terms, and the corresponding values for PRoc1 on WT10G is 100, 30, 10 and 10. Thus, the optimal values of wSize depend on the proximity measures and the collections.",1,WT,True
"Another phenomenon is that the more the expansion terms are selected, the more the performance is affected by wSize. Normally, the performance of PRoc models drops when wSize takes a relatively large value. However, to what extent the performance is affected is determined by the number of expansion terms. Specifically, in Figure 2, while wSize is relatively small, the performance of PRoc models with 50 expansion terms is the best. However, when wSize is larger than 200, the curves for 50 expansion terms are constantly below all the others. As an additional example, when the number of expansion terms is 30, the performance of PRoc models is the second worst in most cases when wSize is 1500.",1,ad,True
"This is reasonable because the accumulated influence of proximity information for 50 expansion terms is larger than that of the small numbers. When wSize increases, it is very likely that more noise is adopted in the expansion term selection. The more expansion term are there, the more noisy information is involved. Thus, the wSize must be set very carefully when the number of expansion is larger than 30 in our case.",1,ad,True
"Additionally, the influence of wSize on PRoc1 is more significant than on the other two over WT10G. Meanwhile, wSize affects PRoc2 more significantly over GOV2 than PRoc1 and PRoc3. Overall, the PRoc3 model is less sensi-",1,WT,True

"In summary, a big challenge is to find an optimal value since the value space is very large without any constraints. It is very time-consuming to try every possible values in the relevance feedback process. In order to narrow the value space of wSize, we attempt to find a rule to direct the searching of optimal values. Based on our experimental results, we conjecture that there are two factors affecting the choice of wSize: the average document length (ADL) and the size of a collection. Intuitively, if the average document length is large, it is more likely to have more than one topic in a document which leads to involve more irrelevant terms. Besides, as the increase of the size of collection, it is more likely to bring irrelevant documents into the feedback process.",1,ad,True
"In order to minimize the negative influence of noise, the values of wSize should be relatively small especially when the ADL or collection size is large. Only the closest terms will be considered to avoid the selection of irrelevant terms. In our experiments, this rule is supported by some evidence. The ADL of Disk4&5 is 334 and there are only 528,155 documents in this collection. The performance of all the PRoc models is not affected by wSize so extensively as that on",0,,False
"the other collections. When there are only 10 expansion terms, the optimal value of wSize can be as large as 1500. On WT10G, which has 1,692,096 documents and an average document length of 426, the optimal wSize values are larger than 50 but smaller than 200. For WT2G, even it has less documents (247,491) than other collections, the optimal wSize values are in a range of (30, 50) because of its long ADL (722). GOV2 is the largest collection with 25,178,548 documents in our experiments, and its ADL(679) is only smaller than that of WT2G. As a result, the optimal values of wSize for GOV2 is the smallest one. It is always 10 in our case. In summary, we can use this rule to narrow the search space of optimal wSize values. If a collection has plenty of documents or its ADL is large (e.g., more than 700), it is always good for us to start from 20 or smaller. Otherwise, we can try a larger starting value like 50 or more.",1,WT,True

To make the comparison fair, we train our parameters on the Terabyte05 topics and use Terabyte06 2 topics on the GOV2 collection for testing as Lv. et al. did in [16]. Since we do not give results for the Million Query Track so far, we do not compare our method with PRM on the ClueWeb collection with the topics of this track. In [16], parameter  in the Dirichlet smoothing is set to an optimal value of 1500, and we set b in our basic model, BM25, empirically to 0.3 [44]. As we mentioned previously, the performance of BM25 and LM with Dirichlet smoothing does not differ significantly on the GOV2 collection. Therefore, this setting will not affect the comparison. Since PRoc3 is the most robust and performs the best generally, it is selected to make this comparison. There are two versions of PRM, PRM1 and PRM2. The results of RM3, PRM1 and PRM2 are directly from [16].",1,Terabyte,True
"In Table 7, PRoc3 outperforms the classic Rocchio's model and RM3 significantly in terms of the MAP metric, and it is only slightly inferior to PRM1 and PRM2 by 1.19% and 1.1% respectively. On the P@10, P@30 and P@100 metrics, PRoc3 obtains the best results over all the other four models and outperforms RM3, PRM1 and PRM2 significantly. All these significant tests are based on the Wilcoxon matchedpairs signed-ranks test at the 0.05 level. This shows that the retrieval accuracy of our proposed model is better than that of the PRF models in the language modeling framework in this case. Since the results of PRM1 and PRM2 are optimized, it is reasonable to state that our propose model is at least comparable to the most recent progress.",1,MAP,True
6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK,0,,False
"In this paper, a novel feedback model PRoc is proposed by incorporating proximity information into the classic Rocchio's model. Specifically, we model the statistics of expansion terms and their proximity relationship with query terms by introducing a new concept ptf . Three proximity measures, namely window-based method, kernel-based method and the HAL method, are then proposed for evaluating the relationship between expansion terms and query terms. The corresponding PRoc models based on these measures, PRoc1, PRoc2 and PRoc3, are evaluated extensively on four standard TREC collections. In general, PRoc is very effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art feedback models in different frameworks. Comparing the three variants of PRoc, PRoc3 is more effective and robust than PRoc1 and PRoc2. Meanwhile, our proposed PRoc is at least competitive to the most recent work, PRM. Additionally, we carefully analyze the influence of the parameter of wSize, and an empirical rule to narrow the value space of the window size is suggested.",1,corpora,True

"In the future, we will try to discover more about how to effectively adapt proximity into the probabilistic retrieval models. Another possible research direction is to find the exact relationship between the window size factor and the information of collections, e.g., the length distribution of documents. It is also interesting to apply our work to other retrieval frameworks, like DFR or the language modeling framework.",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Query spelling correction is a crucial component of modern search engines. Existing methods in the literature for search query spelling correction have two major drawbacks. First, they are unable to handle certain important types of spelling errors, such as concatenation and splitting. Second, they cannot efficiently evaluate all the candidate corrections due to the complex form of their scoring functions, and a heuristic filtering step must be applied to select a working set of top-K most promising candidates for final scoring, leading to non-optimal predictions. In this paper we address both limitations and propose a novel generalized Hidden Markov Model with discriminative training that can not only handle all the major types of spelling errors, including splitting and concatenation errors, in a single unified framework, but also efficiently evaluate all the candidate corrections to ensure the finding of a globally optimal correction. Experiments on two query spelling correction datasets demonstrate that the proposed generalized HMM is effective for correcting multiple types of spelling errors. The results also show that it significantly outperforms the current approach for generating top-K candidate corrections, making it a better firststage filter to enable any other complex spelling correction algorithm to have access to a better working set of candidate corrections as well as to cover splitting and concatenation errors, which few existing method in academic literature can correct.",1,Query,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"The ability to automatically correct potentially misspelled queries has become an indispensable component of modern search engines. People make errors in spelling frequently. Particularly, search engine users are more likely to commit misspellings in their queries as they are in most scenarios exploring unfamiliar contents. Automatic spelling correction for queries helps the search engine to better understand the users' intents and can therefore improve the quality of search experience. However, query spelling is not an easy task, especially under the strict efficiency constraint. In Table 1 we summarize major types of misspellings in real search engine queries. Users not only make typos on single words, (insertion, deletion and substitution), but can also easily mess up with word boundaries (concatenation and splitting). Moreover, different types of misspelling could be committed in the same query, making it even harder to correct. Unfortunately,",0,,False

"no existing query spelling correction approaches in the literature are able to correct all major types of errors, especially for correcting splitting and concatenation errors. To the best of my knowledge, the only work that can potentially address this problem is [24] in which a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is proposed to handle a broad set of query refinements. However, this work considers query correction and splitting/merging as different tasks, hence it is unable to correct queries with mixed types of errors, such as substitution and splitting errors in one query. In fact splitting and merging are two important error types in query spelling correction, and a major research challenge of query spelling correction is to accurately correct all major types of errors simultaneously. On the other hand, while modern industrial systems such as Google can handle this problem relatively well, it's unclear what they have done, especially what resources they have employed in order to solve the challenges.",1,ad,True
"Another major difficulty in automatic query spelling correction is the huge search space. Theoretically, any sequence",0,,False

"of characters could potentially be the correction of a misspelled query. It is clearly intractable to enumerate and evaluate all possible sequences for the purpose of finding the correct query. Thus a more feasible strategy is to search in a space of all combinations of candidate words that are in a neighborhood of each query word based on editing distance. The assumption is that a user's spelling error of each single word is unlikely too dramatic, thus the correction is most likely in the neighborhood by editing distance. Unfortunately, even in this restricted space, the current approaches still cannot enumerate and evaluate all the candidates because their scoring functions involve complex features that are expensive to compute. As a result, a separate filtering step must first be used to prune the search space so that the final scoring can be done on a small working set of candidates. Take [7] as a two-stage method example, in the first stage, a Viterbi or A* search algorithm is used to generate a small set of most promising candidates, and in the second stage different types of features of the candidates are computed and a ranker is employed to score the candidates. However, this two-stage strategy has a major drawback in computing the complete working set. Since the filtering stage uses a non-optimal objective function to ensure efficiency, it is quite possible that the best candidate is filtered out in the first stage, especially because we cannot afford a large working set since the correction must be done online while a user is entering a query. The inability of searching the complete space of candidates leads to non-optimal correction accuracy.",1,ad,True
"In this paper, we propose a generalized Hidden Markov Model (gHMM) for query spelling correction that can address deficiencies of the existing approaches discussed above. The proposed gHMM can model all major types of spelling errors, thus enabling consideration of multiple types of errors in query spelling correction. In the proposed gHMM, the hidden states represent the correct forms of words, and the outcomes are the observed (potentially) misspelled terms. In addition, each state is associated with a type, indicating merging, splitting or in-word transformation operation. The proposed HMM is generalized in the sense that it would allow adjustment of both emission probabilities and transition probabilities to accommodate the non-optimal parameter estimation. Unfortunately, such an extension of HMM makes it impossible to use a standard EM algorithm for parameter estimation. To solve this problem, we propose a perceptron-based discriminative training method to train the parameters in the HMM.",1,ad,True
"Moreover, a Viterbi-like search algorithm for top-K paths is designed to efficiently obtain a small number of highly confident correction candidates. This algorithm can handle splitting/merging of multiple words. It takes into account major types of local features such as error model, language model, and state type information. The error model is trained on a large set of query correction pairs from the web. And web scale language model is obtained by leveraging the Microsoft Web N-gram service [1].",0,,False
"We conducted extensive evaluation on our proposed gHMM. For this purpose, we have constructed a query correction dataset from real search logs, which has been made publicly available. Experimental results verify that the gHMM can effectively correct all major types of query spelling errors. It also reveal that the gHMM can run as efficient as the common used noisy channel model, while it achieves much",1,ad,True
"better results for obtaining the candidate space of query corrections. Therefore, in addition to being used as standing alone query correction module, the proposed gHMM can also be used as a more effective first-stage filtering module to more effectively support any other complicated scoring functions such as those using complex global features.",1,ad,True
2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
"Spelling correction has a long history [8]. Traditional spellers focused on dealing with non-word errors caused by misspelling a known word as an invalid word form. A common strategy at that time was to utilize a trusted lexicon and certain distance measures, such as Levenshtein distance [13]. The size of lexicon in traditional spellers is usually small due to the high cost of manual construction of lexicon. Consequently, many valid word forms such as human names and neologisms are rarely included in the lexicon. Later, statistical generative models were introduced for spelling correction, in which the error model and n-gram language model are identified as two critical components. Brill and Moore demonstrated that a better statistical error model is crucial for improving a speller's accuracy [3]. But building such an error model requires a large set of manually annotated word correction pairs, which is expensive to obtain. Whitelaw et al. alleviated this problem by leveraging the Web to automatically discover the misspelled/corrected word pairs [12].",1,ad,True
"With the advent of the Web, the research on spelling correction has received much more attention, particularly on the correction of search engine queries. Many research challenges are raised, which are non-existent in traditional settings of spelling correction. More specifically, there are many more types of spelling errors in search queries, such as misspelling, concatenation/splitting of query words, and misuse of legitimate yet inappropriate words. Research in this direction includes utilizing large web corpora and query log [4, 5, 2], training phrase-based error model from clickthrough data [10] and developing additional features [7]. However, two important challenges are under addressed in these approaches, i.e., correcting splitting and concatenation errors, and ensuring complete search in the candidate space to evaluate an effective scoring function.",1,ad,True
"Query alteration/refinement is a broader topic which naturally subsumes query spelling correction. Beside correcting the misspelled query, query alteration/refinement also need to modify the ineffective query so that it could be more suitable for the search intent. For this purpose, many research topics have been studied. Query expansion expands the query with additional terms to enrich the query formulation [14, 15, 16]. Query segmentation divides a query into semantically meaningful sub-units [17, 18]. Other query reformulation methods intend to replace the inappropriate query terms with effective keywords to bridge the vocabulary gaps [19]. Particularly, there is research attempt [24] to use a unified model to do a broad set of query refinements such as correction, segmentation and even stemming. However, it treats query correction and splitting/merging as separate tasks, which is not true for real world queries. Also, it has very limited ability for query correction. For example, it only allows one letter difference in deletion/insertion/substitution errors.",1,Query,True

"Formally, let  be the alphabet of a language and L  + be a large lexicon of the language. We define the query spelling correction problem as:",0,,False
"Given a query q  +, generate top-K most effective corrections Y ,"" (y1, y2, ..., yk) where yi  L+ is a candidate correction, and Y is sorted according to the probability of yi being the correct spelling of the target query.""",0,,False
"It is worth noting that from a search engine perspective, the ideal output Y should be sorted according to the probability of yi retrieving the most satisfying results in search. However, in practice it is very difficult to measure the satisfaction as unlike in ad hoc retrieval where the query is given in its correct form, here the real query is unknown. As a result, different corrections could simply lead to queries with different meanings and it would be very subjective to determine which query actually satisfies the user. In this paper, we are mostly concerned with the lexical and semantic correctness of queries with the assumption that correction of mis-spelled query terms most likely would lead to improved retrieval accuracy.",1,ad,True
"The problem of query spelling correction is significantly harder than the traditional spelling correction. Previous researches show that approximately 10-15% of search queries contain spelling errors [5]. First, it is difficult to cover all the different types of errors. The spelling errors generally fall into one of the following four categories: (1) in-word transformation, e.g. insertion, deletion, misspelling of characters. This type of error is most frequent in web queries, and it is not uncommon that up to 3 or 4 letters are misspelled; (2) mis-use of valid word, e.g. ""persian golf""  ""persian gulf"". It is also a type of in-word tranformation errors; (3) concatenation of multiple words, e.g. ""unitedstatesofamerica""  ""united states of america""; (4) splitting a word into parts, e.g. ""power point slides""  ""powerpoint slides"". Among all these types, the splitting and concatenation errors are especially challenging to correct. Indeed, no existing approaches in the academic literature can correct these two types of errors. Yet, it's important to correct all types of errors because users might commit different types of errors or even commit these errors at the same time. A main goal of this work is to develop a new HMM framework that can model and correct all major types of errors including splitting and concatenation.",1,ad,True
"Second, it is difficult to ensure complete search of all the candidate space because the candidate space is very large. The existing work addresses this challenge by using a twostage method, which searches for a small set of candidates with simple scoring functions and do re-ranking on top of these candidates. Unfortunately, the simple scoring function used in the first stage cannot ensure that the nominated candidate corrections in the first stage always contain the best correction, thus no matter how effective the final scoring function is, we may miss the best correction simply because of the use of two separate stages. In this paper, we address",1,ad,True

Therefore, finding best-K corrections Y "","" (y1, y2, ..., yk) is equivalent to finding best-K state sequences Z "","" (z1, z2, ..., zk). In addition, there is a type t associated with each state, indicating the operation such as substitution, splitting, merging etc. Also, in order to facilitate the merging state we introduce a NULL state. The NULL state is represented by an empty string, and it doesn't emit any phrase. There can be multiple consecutive NULL states followed by a merging state. Table 2 summarizes the state types and the spelling errors they correspond to. Having the hidden states defined, the hypothesized process of observing a mis-spelled query is as follows:""",1,ad,True

To do this, we make use of the Wikipedia data. Particularly, we select the top 2 million words from Wikipedia by their word frequencies, and automatically curate the obtained words by removing those frequent but illegitimate words from the vocabulary. This curate process involves checking if the word appears in the title of a Wikipedia article, comparing the bigram probability of other words etc. Finally we obtained 1.2 million highly reliable words in the vocabulary.

Given these considerations, we adopt the Weighted Edit Distance (WED) to estimate the error model.

In our study, we find the title model is the most effective for query spelling correction. We hypothesize that this may be because the training data for query model is much noisier. Particularly, misspelled queries may be included in the training data, which makes it less effective for the task of spelling correction.

"We first investigate the overall effectiveness of the gHMM model. For suitable query spelling correction baselines, especially approaches that can handle all types of query spelling errors, we first considered using the CRF model proposed in [24]. This method aims at a broad range of query refinements and hence might be also applicable to query correction. However, we decided not to compare this model for the following reasons. Firstly, we communicated with the authors of [24] and knew that the program is un-reusable. Secondly, as mentioned in Section 1 this work suffers from several drawbacks for query spelling correction: (1) it is unable to correct queries with mixed types of errors, such as substitution and splitting errors in one query, because the model treats query correction and splitting/merging as different tasks; (2) this model only allows 1 character error for substitution/insertion/deletion. And the error model is trained on the <query, correction> examples that only contain 1 character error. Such design is over simplified for real-world queries, in which more than 1 character errors are quite common. In fact, within the queries that contain spelling errors in the MSN dataset, there are about 40.6% of them contain more than 1 character errors. Therefore it is expected model in [24] will have in inferior performance",1,ad,True

We communicated with the author and obtained the corrections by running the Web API of this baseline approach. We also include a simple baseline called Echo, which is just echoing the original query as the correction response with posterior probability 1. It reflects the basic performance for a naive method. Experiments are conducted on TREC and MSN datasets.",1,AP,True

The results in Table 3 indicate that gHMM outperforms Lueck-2011 significantly on recall and F1 on the TREC dataset. Lueck-2011 has a small advantage on precision, possibly due to the better handling the unchanged queries. On the MSN dataset which is considered harder since it has more misspelled queries, gHMM also achieves high precision of 0.910 and recall of 0.966, which are both significantly better than that of the Lueck-2011 (0.896 and 0.921). On another important performance metric, which measures the F1 on misspelled queries (F1 Mis), gHMM outperforms Lueck-2011 by a large margin (0.550 vs. 0.391 on TREC and 0.566 vs. 0.363 on MSN).

The breakdown results show that most queries are in the group of ""no error"", which are easier to handle than the other three types. As a result, the overall excellent performance was mostly because the system performed very well on the ""no error"" group. Indeed, the system has substantially lower precision on the queries with the other three types of errors.

"candidate space and compute the top-K spelling corrections in a one-stage manner, it is very interesting to test its effectiveness for constructing a working set of candidate corrections to enable more complex scoring functions to be used for spelling correction. For this purpose, we compare gHMM with the common used noisy channel model, whose parameters, namely error model probabilities and bigram language probabilities are estimated by the procedure mentioned in previous sections. We use recall to measure the completeness of the constructed working set, because it represents the percentage of true corrections given the number of predicted corrections. Table 5 shows the recall according to different number of outputs. It indicates that the recall of gHMM is steadily increasing by a larger number of outputs. By only outputting top-5 corrections, gHMM reaches recall of 0.969 in TREC and 0.964 in MSN. In contrast, the noisy channel model has a substantial gap in term of recall compared to gHMM. This result strongly demonstrates the superior effectiveness of gHMM in constructing a more complete working set of candidate corrections, which can be utilized by other re-ranking approaches which could further improve the correction accuracy.",1,ad,True

"In this paper, we presented a novel generalized hidden Markov model (gHMM) for query spelling correction that can address two major deficiencies of previous approaches to query spelling correction, i.e., inability of handling all the major types of spelling errors, and inability of searching efficiently in the complete candidate space. We have also proposed a novel discriminative training method for the gHMM model which enables us to go beyond regular HMM to incorporate useful local features for more effective query spelling correction. Experiment results on two query correction datasets show that gHMM can effectively handle all the major types of spelling errors and outperforms a stateof-the-art baseline by a large margin.",1,ad,True
"Moreover, our generalized HMM, equipped with the discriminative training, scores the query corrections directly and output a final ranked list of spelling corrections, without needing a filtering stage to prune the candidate space as typically required by an existing method. We have demonstrated that as an efficient one-stage approach, the proposed gHMM can also be used as a filter to construct a more complete working set than the existing noisy channel filter, making it possible to combine it with any complicated spelling correction methods to further improve accuracy. In other words, the proposed gHMM model can serve as a better candidate generation method in a two-stage framework where any sophisticated and potentially more effective spelling correction method can be applied to re-rank the generated candidates",0,,False

"In this work, we only focused on local feature functions in order to ensure efficient evaluation of all the candidates in the search space. However, some global features, such as the overall editing distance, frequency of the query in a query log can be potentially utilized to further improve the correction accuracy. How to add the global features to the gHMM model, while still ensuring efficient search and evaluation of all the candidates in the search space, is an interesting direction for future work.",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Dynamic pruning strategies permit efficient retrieval by not fully scoring all postings of the documents matching a query ­ without degrading the retrieval effectiveness of the topranked results. However, the amount of pruning achievable for a query can vary, resulting in queries taking different amounts of time to execute. Knowing in advance the execution time of queries would permit the exploitation of online algorithms to schedule queries across replicated servers in order to minimise the average query waiting and completion times. In this work, we investigate the impact of dynamic pruning strategies on query response times, and propose a framework for predicting the efficiency of a query. Within this framework, we analyse the accuracy of several query efficiency predictors across 10,000 queries submitted to in-memory inverted indices of a 50-million-document Web crawl. Our results show that combining multiple efficiency predictors with regression can accurately predict the response time of a query before it is executed. Moreover, using the efficiency predictors to facilitate online scheduling algorithms can result in a 22% reduction in the mean waiting time experienced by queries before execution, and a 7% reduction in the mean completion time experienced by users.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Large-scale information retrieval (IR) systems ­ such as Web search engines ­ are not just concerned with the quality of search results (also known as effectiveness), but also with the speed with which the results are obtained (efficiency). These aspects form a natural tradeoff, in that many approaches that increase effectiveness may have a corresponding impact on efficiency due to their complex nature [31].",1,ad,True
"Hence, as users exhibit preferences for faster search engines [6], to deploy techniques to improve effectiveness, search engines need to identify other opportunities for efficiency optimisations. One such technique is the use of caching, either of the search results for a query, or the posting lists of terms from the inverted index [3]. Increasingly, caching is being used for the posting lists of all terms, such that retrieval",0,,False

"occurs from in-memory indices, and thus all expensive disk I/O operations are avoided [12, 15].",0,,False
"The exhaustive scoring of every document that contains at least one query term also degrades efficiency unnecessarily, because very few of these documents will make the top retrieved set of documents that the user will see. Dynamic pruning strategies such as MaxScore [30] and Wand [5] address this by omitting (pruning) the scoring of documents that cannot make the top-K retrieved documents set.",1,ad,True
"Of course, more than one machine is typically involved in answering a query to a Web search engine [7, 12]. For instance, more than one query server can service queries for a replicated index, thereby improving overall response time. However, no previous work has examined the most effective way to schedule queries across the query servers. In this paper, we argue that scheduling algorithms that take into account the queued workload for that server can be used to ensure efficient use of query servers resources.",1,ad,True
"However, accurate scheduling requires estimations of the execution times of queries. Yet, as we will show in this paper, one query may take substantially longer than another query with apparently similar statistics. Indeed, we explain why some queries are difficult to prune, whereby many documents are fully scored before later being expelled from the retrieved set by other documents. Hence, the difficulty is determined by how early the final top documents are retrieved when traversing the posting lists, to allow successful pruning. Accurately estimating this difficulty and hence the response time of a query will permit the efficient scheduling of queries in a replicated setting.",0,,False
"In this paper we propose a framework of query efficiency predictors that can estimate the execution time of a given query. Experiments using 10,000 queries from a Web search engine query log demonstrate the accuracy of these predictors. Moreover, we show how query efficiency prediction can be used to reduce query response time by the improved scheduling of queries across replicated query servers. Indeed, scheduling while making use of efficiency predictions can result in a 22% reduction in the average waiting time experienced by queries, and a 7% reduction in the average query completion time experienced by users.",0,,False

2. BACKGROUND,0,,False
"To spread the retrieval load of a large document corpus on a search engine, the inverted index can be partitioned into shards and distributed across multiple query servers, and/or identical indices replicated across query servers [12]. For distributed settings, queries arriving at the front-end server or broker are sent to multiple query servers, while the broker collates the results. For replicated settings, queries arriving at the broker are routed to the next available query server [7]. However, we know of no work that discusses different approaches for the routing or scheduling of queries across replicated query servers. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing the scheduling of queries across replicated query servers.",1,ad,True
"Next, while the inverted index was traditionally stored on disk, with the predominance of inexpensive memory, search engines are increasingly caching the entire inverted index in memory, to assure low latency responses [12, 15].",1,ad,True
"Despite these optimisations, the matching of documents still uses the classical inverted index data structure to score and rank documents [12]. Moreover, due to its data bound nature, this represents the largest contribution to the time for a search engine to retrieve documents in response to a query. Indeed, to create a ranking of documents for a query, the posting lists for each query term must be traversed [23].",0,,False
"Various techniques that prune documents that are unlikely to be retrieved have been devised to improve efficiency. Some rely on pre-sorting the posting lists of different terms by the impact of the postings [2], or by removing documents that are unlikely to be retrieved (with possible loss of retrieval effectiveness) [4]. However, we focus on techniques that are safe-to-rank-K ­ i.e. cannot degrade retrieval effectiveness to a given rank K ­ and use docid sorted posting lists, as deployed by at least one major search engine [12]. In particular, dynamic pruning strategies aim to avoid the scoring of postings for documents that cannot make the top K retrieved set. All state-of-the-art safe dynamic pruning strategies [5, 28, 30]1 aim to avoid scoring parts of the posting lists, to save disk access, decompression and score computation costs. This is implemented by maintaining additional information during retrieval, namely: a threshold  , which is the minimum score that documents must achieve to have a chance to be present in the final top K results; and for each query term, a term upper bound (t), which is the maximal contribution of that particular term to any document score. The upper bound is usually obtained by pre-scanning the posting lists of each term at indexing time, to record the maximum score found in each posting list [10].",1,ad,True
"We use two such dynamic pruning strategies that score postings in a document-at-a-time (DAAT) manner, namely MaxScore [30] and Wand [5]. Compared to the scoring of every posting of every document (which we refer to as Full), both strategies can efficiently score documents while beingsafe-to-rank K, and do not require impact-sorted posting lists. Instead, the postings for every term have the same global ordering, such that they can be read in parallel.",1,ad,True
"MaxScore achieves efficient retrieval by omitting the scoring of postings for documents that will not make the final retrieved set. In contrast, Wand takes a different approach, by repeatedly calculating a pivot term. The next document",0,,False
"1We omit the database-focused algorithms of Fagin et al. [14] - these assume random access on the posting list, which is generally not possible when compression is used.",0,,False
"containing the pivot term is the pivot document, which will be the next document to be fully scored. A major benefit of Wand over MaxScore is that skipping [24] forward in posting lists can be used by Wand, which reduces posting list decompression overheads, and can reduce IO, with resulting improvements in efficiency [15, 22]. Indeed, Wand represents the state-of-the-art in dynamic pruning. Moreover, both MaxScore and Wand can equally be applied to inverted indices stored on disk or in-memory [15].",1,ad,True
"Moffat et al. [23] stated that the response time of a query is related to the posting list lengths of its constituent query terms. However, as we will show in Section 5, dynamic pruning causes queries with similar surface properties (e.g. query terms, posting list lengths) to widely vary in the time required to process. Hence, to have a better estimation of a query's response time, we propose a novel framework for query efficiency prediction. Moreover, we investigate the advantages of query efficiency prediction when applied to improved online scheduling of queries to replicated query servers. The notion of query efficiency prediction first appeared in [29], where initial experiments for disk-based indices showed some promise. In contrast, this work performs a more detailed study into efficiency prediction for inmemory indices, and uses efficiency prediction for enhancing replicated retrieval architectures.",1,ad,True
"We contrast query efficiency prediction with works from the literature on query performance prediction that have tried to predict the effectiveness of a query [17], either before retrieval commences (pre-retrieval prediction) [18], or by inspecting the scores or contents of retrieved documents (post-retrieval prediction) [1, 11]. Performance predictors have also been combined using machine learning [19, 21]. However, no previous work has attempted the different task of efficiency prediction. This work defines pre-retrieval efficiency predictors, and applies these to the scheduling of queries in a replicated retrieval setting.",0,,False

"All of the experiments in the following sections are conducted using a 50 million document corpus called TREC ClueWeb09 category B. We index this corpus using the Terrier IR platform [26]2, applying Porter's English stemmer, and removing standard stopwords. In the posting lists of the inverted index, docids are encoded using Elias Gammaencoded deltas and term frequencies using Elias Unary [13]. Each posting list also includes skip points [24], one every 1,000 postings. The resulting inverted index size is 22GB.",1,TREC,True
"For testing retrieval efficiency, we extract a stream of user queries from a real search engine log, and measure the query response time and the number of postings scored when retrieving with all index data structures loaded in memory. Experiments are made using a dual quad-core Intel Xeon 2.6GHz, with 8GB RAM. In particular, we select the first 16,775 queries of the MSN 2006 query log [9], applying Porter's English stemmer and removing standard stopwords (empty queries are removed). This amounts to 10,000 queries of more than one term (single term queries cannot be pruned). Table 1 shows the distribution of queries by length3. Moreover, this sample exhibits the expected power law distributional of query occurrences: e.g. 1 query occurs 88 times, and 6,279 queries occurred once.",1,ad,True
"During retrieval, we apply three retrieval strategies: an exhaustive DAAT Full, where all postings for each document are exhaustively scored; MaxScore [30]; and Wand [5]. Moreover, as our inverted index is larger than the available RAM, we discard the posting lists of terms that do not occur in the 16,775 queries. This is justified as it simulates an in-memory index environment without having to partition the index across multiple servers. Hence, while our query response times may be larger than would suffice for an interactive environment, this does not detract from the validity of the experiments. Documents are ranked for each query using BM25, with Terrier's default parameter settings, while the number of documents retrieved is set to K ,"" 1, 000.""",0,,False
5. ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE TIMES,0,,False
"To predict the efficiency of queries, we must first understand the characteristics of response times given by various retrieval strategies. While Moffat et al. [23] claimed that the main components of a query's response time are related to the number of terms in the query, and the length of the term's posting lists, there is some other anecdotal literature evidence that the response time of a dynamic pruning strategy can vary widely, even for queries with the same total number of postings to consider [3]. While Gan & Suel [16] assumed that the total postings was a sufficiently accurate estimation for caching decisions, Ozcan et al. [27] instead used actual response times, due to the variation in response times. In this section, we fully analyse and explain the variation in response times of different retrieval strategies. We",1,ad,True
"2http://terrier.org/ 3As there are very few queries with 6 or more terms, we omit these in the following experiments, and hence they do not appear in the train and test sets.",0,,False
also show that the total number of postings does not accurately predict the response times of all pruning strategies.,0,,False
"Figures 1(a)-(d) show the response time distributions for different query lengths and different strategies, for 10,000 queries with more than one query term. Ideally, most queries should have small response times ­ indicated by the highest frequency of response time being small, i.e. towards the left.",0,,False
"From Figure 1, we can see that different retrieval strategies exhibit different response time distributions. Indeed, while MaxScore shows only a small improvement w.r.t. Full, Wand markedly improves the response times for any query length, as it has the most number of queries with low response times, despite having to traverse the same posting lists of the same length as the other strategies. Moreover, a clear variance in the response times of queries for each strategy can be observed, even across queries of the same length. This is expected, as different queries have different numbers of postings that must be traversed.",0,,False
"Yet, due to their pruning behaviour, the number of postings to process does not fully depict the retrieval times of all pruning strategies. To illustrate this, Figure 2 shows scatter plots for total postings and response time for Full, MaxScore and Wand. From Figure 2(a), a strong correlation between the total number of postings and the query response times can be observed for Full, independently from the number of terms in the query. This correlation is explained by the fact that the strategy scores every posting for each query term, without any pruning. However, the correlations observed in Figure 2(b) & (c) for the MaxScore and Wand strategies are weaker. In particular, the response time for a query with a given number of postings can be markedly lower than another query with the same number of postings ­ for instance, queries with 2 million postings usually take between 1.8 to 3.2 seconds with MaxScore, and 0.9 to 2.0 seconds for Wand. Hence, the amount of pruning possible varies between queries, even for those same length and number of postings. Moreover, as Wand is able to prune some queries more aggressively than MaxScore, its exhibits less correlation between total postings and response times.",0,,False
"To explain why different queries vary in their pruning difficulty, we turn to Figure 3. This shows the distribution of weighting model scores for two example queries, each with two query terms occurring in two documents, where the top K ,"" 1 ranked document is required. Vertical arrows denote the scores of postings, with the upper bound (t) for each term represented by a horizontal dashed line. The threshold  after scoring each document is shown. As this is a DAAT process, the postings lists of all terms for a query are processed in parallel. After scoring the first document in query 1, the threshold (score of the Kth retrieved document) is  "","" 7. Hence, for the second document, after scoring the posting for the first term, MaxScore can assert that each document will not reach the retrieved set, as score(t1) + (t2) "","" 2 + 2 < 7. Hence the posting for the second query term of that document is pruned (dotted). In contrast, for query 2, all postings must be considered for the second document, as the score of the first term's posting for that document is not low enough that it cannot be retrieved - i.e. score(t1) + (t2) "", 3 + 3  6. We say that the query 1 is easier to prune than query 2.",0,,False

However, the pruning ratio or the number of scored postings cannot be obtained before retrieval commences. We posit that various statistics of the query terms that are available offline can be used to predict the response time of a query before retrieval commences. In the next section, we propose a framework for query efficiency prediction, and evaluate various efficiency predictors within this framework. We then show one novel application of the query efficiency prediction framework, namely the online scheduling of queries to replicated query servers.",1,ad,True
6. PREDICTING QUERY EFFICIENCY,0,,False
"Having an accurate estimate of the efficiency of a query can be useful to a search engine in many ways. For instance, in a replicated setting, if the availability of query servers can be predicted by the broker, then a new query could be scheduled to the query server expected to be idle soonest.",0,,False
"To be of use, efficiency predictors must be pre-retrieval i.e. available before retrieval for a query has commenced, and easily obtained at retrieval time (similar to some query performance predictors [18]). Indeed, a post-retrieval efficiency predictor is of no use, as the response time of the query is known after retrieval has occurred. Hence, our efficiency predictors are based on the available statistics of the query terms (frequency, number of postings, IDF etc). We note that some pre-retrieval query performance predictors (e.g. AvPMI [17]) use the joint probability of a pair of query terms.

"As we have shown in Section 5, pruning difficulty varies between queries, and hence the response time of a query cannot be directly predicted. Moreover, as it is infeasible to generate offline features for the universe of possible queries, we instead use statistics that are computed for each term. These are then aggregated (e.g. sum, max) across all of the constituent terms of a query, to form different features for a given query.

"In terms of features, we rely on more than the frequency counts and IDFs of the query terms that have been traditionally applied by query performance predictors. In particular, recall that dynamic pruning strategies require an upper bound (t) on the weighting model score for each term.

From Table 2, we highlight some representative term statistics: Arithmetic, geometric, harmonic score means : Means of the weighting model scores from the term's postings.

Table 1 provides the distribution of queries w.r.t. query length. We form training and testing subsets, by splitting the query sets of each length into two equal sets chronologically4. The training set will be used to train the regression models in the following sections, while all results are reported on the testing set.

"We firstly analyse the results in Table 3 for each retrieval strategy in turn. For Full, the most accurate efficiency predictor is the total number of postings (Sum # Postings), as each posting is scored. Some other predictors, namely Sum # Maxima and Sum # Maxima > average score exhibit similar accuracies. This is easily explainable, as a docid-sorted index typically has no trend on score distribution, so the maxima are evenly distributed along the scores of a postings list, and the number of maxima tends to be half of the total number of entries.",0,,False
"For the MaxScore retrieval strategy, which does prune, the baseline predictor of Sum # Postings is less accurate than for Full. However, the best predictors are the baseline predictor and, again, Sum # Maxima and Sum # Maxima > average score, mostly because MaxScore cannot prune many queries (as shown in Figure 4(a)). For Wand, the predicted vs. actual response time correlations of the baseline predictor feature are again overall lower, as Wand prunes more aggressively than MaxScore (Figure 4(a) & (b)), and is also the only pruning strategy able to skip whole portions of postings lists. For these reasons, the observed lower correlation with number of postings is expected. Instead, the Sum # Maxima > avg and Sum # Maxima features are promising, but not significantly better than the baseline.",1,ad,True
"Finally, we note that no feature based on IDF appeared in the top prediction features in Table 3. This suggests that query efficiency is a different task from query performance (effectiveness) prediction, with different statistics required.",0,,False
"Overall, we conclude that the Sum # Postings is a good single predictor for Full and MaxScore, exhibiting errors of less than 0.25 seconds. For Wand, some other efficiency predictor features show promise, but do not significantly improve over the baseline. We consider that the proposed efficiency features are `weak features'. Hence, in the next section, we show how significantly improved efficiency prediction can be achieved by combining multiple prediction features within the regression, instead of only a single feature.",1,ad,True

"Table 4 reports the correlations and RMSEs between predicted and actual response times observed on the test query set when combining all efficiency prediction features within a linear regression5. On analysing the results, we find that for the Full retrieval strategy, the learned model possibly overfits, and cannot outperform the baseline Sum # Postings feature. Similarly, the fact that MaxScore cannot prune many queries (see Figure 4(a)) ensures that the baseline feature is the most appropriate. However, for Wand, the regression model combining all 42 features is significantly more accurate at predicting response times than the baseline for all query lengths, and markedly improves the RMSEs values (approx 25%-30% reduction, with a prediction error of less than 0.2 seconds observed for queries of length  3).",0,,False
"Overall, we conclude that the proposed framework for efficiency prediction is accurate for predicting the response times of the state-of-the-art Wand strategy, where the total number of postings is not a sufficiently good predictor.

7. APPLYING QUERY EFFICIENCY PREDICTION TO QUERY SCHEDULING,1,AP,True
"While in general the main retrieval efficiency measure is the average time required to process the queries (average response time), when a stream of queries is received by a search engine, it might not be possible to start processing a new query as soon as it arrives. Instead, when the system is busy processing a query, subsequent queries are queued [7]. Therefore, the actual time delay experienced by a user while waiting for search results (completion time) is given by the execution time (response time) of the query, plus the time the query spent waiting to be processed (waiting time).",1,ad,True
"Classically, queued queries have been processed in a FIFO manner (i.e. first-come first-served) [7]. However, this only results in minimising queueing time if each query has an equal response time [20]. Instead, we propose that queues of queries can be scheduled to execute out of arrival order, by deploying specific scheduling algorithms [20]. In this way, for instance, quick queries may be scheduled between longer queries, to reduce the mean time delay experienced by the user population of the search engine.",1,ad,True
"As mentioned in Section 2, an oft-deployed approach to increase query throughput and reduce the average comple-",0,,False
"tion time is to replicate the number of query servers available for a given index shard. Hence, a new query arriving at the broker is sent to a query server that is idle, or least loaded. However, as the number of CPU cores in each query server is finite, it is natural that queries are queued until the query server is able to process them. In this manner, we propose two possible architectures for such a replicated retrieval system, as illustrated in Figure 6 for a single index shard. In the broker queue architecture, newly arrived queries are queued by the broker, before routing to the next available query server. In contrast, in the queue per server architecture, each new query is routed directly to a query server, which queues that query until it can be processed. In both architectures, there are potentials to improve the overall efficiency by the appropriate online scheduling of queries.",1,ad,True
"For instance, in the broker queue architecture, the queue can be sorted to balance throughput. For queue per server, a query can be sent to the query server with the lowest loading, for instance by measuring the number of queries it has queued to process. However, as shown in Section 5, different queries can take different amounts of time to complete, dependent on the nature of the pruning experienced by the query. As a result, a newly arrived query can be scheduled onto a query server that already has a queue of",1,ad,True

"expensive queries, rather than another server which has a queue of inexpensive queries, resulting in poor load balancing across query servers. Instead, in this section, we show how query efficiency predictors can be used to improve the online scheduling of queries to distribute load across query servers, and result in improved mean completion time.",1,ad,True
"In the following we test different methods of online scheduling of queries across replicated query servers, both with a single broker queue and with a queue per server. For the former, we consider three scheduling methods [20]: First Come First Served (FCFS): Incoming queries are kept sorted in arrival order, and as soon as a server is idle, it starts processing the first query in the queue [7]. FCFS does not need any information about the execution time of a query, and hence forms our baseline. Actual Shortest Job First (ASJF): Incoming queries are kept sorted in increasing order of expected service time, and scheduled to the servers in that order. ASJF assumes knowledge of the actual execution time a query will take, and hence represents scheduling with perfect knowledge, forming an oracle. ASJF is the optimal schedule to reduce the mean queueing time experiences by each query [20]. Predicted Shortest Job First (PSJF): As ASJF, but uses predicted execution times provided by our framework from Section 6 instead of actual times.",1,ad,True
"When the queue per server architecture is used, an incoming query is dispatched by the broker to a server as soon as it arrives, and then queued by that server until retrieval can commence. In this scenario, we test three methods for dispatching queries to server: Queue Length (QL): Queries are scheduled onto the query server with the shortest queue length. This represents our baseline. Actual Execution (AE): Queries are scheduled onto the query server with the smallest queue duration time, assuming that the actual execution times of the queued queries are known a-priori. This represents scheduling with perfect knowledge, forming an oracle. Predicted Execution (PE): Queries are scheduled onto the query server with the smallest queue duration time, using predicted execution times provided by our framework from Section 6.",0,,False
"Comparing the two architectures, there are likely advantages in deploying the queue per server architecture, as this does not require the broker to know the predicted response time of a query, which uses statistics likely to be stored with the index. However, scheduling quality might be degraded by the use of multiple queues [25].",1,ad,True

"We devise an experiment that simulates the execution of query processing across multiple query servers, using the actual query arrival times of the 8,278 test queries from the MSN query log for various pruning strategies. This query set includes the original test set of 5,000 multi-term queries used in previous section, as well as single term queries from the same time period (approximately the 2nd 2.5 hours of May 1st 2006). The arrival rate of new queries varies between 20 and 100 per minute.",0,,False
"Predicted and actual query response times are as obtained from the experiments in Section 6 - i.e. for Full and MaxScore, we use the Sum # postings, while, for Wand, to show the benefit of our efficiency prediction framework, we compare Sum # postings and the 42 feature regression model.

Indeed, as all features for each query term are in memory, the floating point operations to compute the predicted response time require very few CPU cycles.

"On analysing Table 5, we firstly note that, as expected, MaxScore and Wand improve over the efficiency of the exhaustive Full. Next, on analysing the scheduling strategies, we find that FCFS performs very poorly when applied to a single server. This is a well-known problem of FCFS [20]: a query requiring a long time to process will delay all subsequent queries that, even if they require a short time to process, must wait for the long query to complete. Nevertheless, AWTs are decreased when dynamic pruning strategies are used: for example, Wand gives a benefit of 97% to the average completion time of FCFS on a single server (309.514 to 10.748 seconds). Moreover, dynamic pruning also helps in reducing the average completion time with FCFS scheduling when multiple servers are used.",1,WT,True
"Next, we compare the scheduling FCFS and ASJF, and observe that in all cases, ASJF results in markedly reduced ACTs and AWTs. This in line with our expectations from the scheduling literature [20]. The margin of improvement decreases as more servers are added, as there is less contention for query servers, and hence scheduling has less effect. Indeed, the query load within this query set is adequately handled by four query servers, as the results are very close to the optimal completion time, i.e. no queries are queued and average waiting times are close to 0. Nevertheless, the overall reduced AWTs and ACTs exhibited by ASJF allow us to conclude that there is the potential for scheduling to improve the efficiency of both non-replicated and replicated retrieval settings.",1,WT,True
"Finally, we examine the use of predicted execution times instead of actual ones (i.e. PSJF). In particular, as expected, for Full and MaxScore, the performance of PSJF(1) is almost the same as ASJF scheduling. However, PSJF(1) ­ i.e. Sum # Postings ­ does not produce accurate estimations of response time for the considerably more efficient Wand. Indeed, using the learned model with all 42 prediction features Wand results in ACT and AWTs that are much closer to the best case ASJF performances ­ e.g., for Wand, PSJF(42) results in a 70% reduction in ACT for a single query server compared to FCFS (from 10.748 seconds to 3.230 seconds).",1,ad,True

7.3 Results: Queue per Server,0,,False
"We now study scheduling in the queue per server architecture. In particular, Table 6 reports the ACTs and AWTs in this architecture6. Three different scheduling methods are tested for measuring the outstanding queue for a query server: Queue Length (QL) ­ baseline, Actual Execution (AE) ­ best-case scheduling ­ and Predicted Execution (PE), which uses predicted response times from the query efficiency prediction framework. Two variants of PE are employed, one using total number of postings alone (1) and one using all 42 prediction features (42). A particular advantage of PE in the queue per server architecture is that the broker does not require the predicted response time of a query, but instead only the predicted response times of the queries already queued on that server.",1,WT,True
"From Table 6 we draw several observations. Firstly, choosing the query server for the next query using QL is worse than AE, across different numbers of servers. Moreover, PE produces results that are only slightly worse than the bestcase AE, and in all cases better than QL. Indeed, with more than three servers, AWTs reduce towards 0 across all pruning strategies. As expected, the PE(1) results are good for Full and MaxScore, however for Wand, PE(42) results in ACTs and AWTs that are much closer to AE than PE(1). Indeed, for two query servers, PE(42) results in a 22% reduction in AWT for Wand compared to QL (from 0.192 seconds to 0.150 seconds), and a 7% reduction in ACT (0.593 to 0.551 seconds). Once again, this shows the accuracy of the query efficiency framework at encapsulating Wand's pruning behaviour.",1,WT,True
"Lastly, we compare Tables 5 & 6 to address our final research question on the two replication architectures. In general, response times are slightly lower using the broker queue architecture. For instance, the ACT of Wand with three query servers using PSJF(42) is 0.420, while PE(42) is slightly higher at 0.433. This is explainable in that the bro-",1,ad,True

"ker queue can be appropriately sorted by expected execution length, while in queue per server, the scheduling of queries is less refined [25]. However, we recognise that queue per server does not require the broker to be able to predict execution times. This is likely beneficial for fully distributed retrieval settings, when the index is sharded across multiple query servers and multiple servers serving each shard, where it is unlikely that the broker can know the predicted response times of all shards.",0,,False
"Overall, we conclude that the online scheduling of queries to query servers can improve the average wait and completion times of queries - indeed, PSJF improved over FCFS for the broker queue architectures, and PE improved over QL for the queue per server architecture. Moreover, such scheduling is made possible by our proposed novel framework for query efficiency prediction, particularly for the most efficient Wand dynamic pruning retrieval strategy.",1,ad,True
8. CONCLUSIONS,0,,False
"Dynamic pruning techniques can improve the efficiency of queries, but result in different queries taking different amounts of time. We empirically investigated the efficiency of different queries for in-memory inverted indices, and showed how and why the amount of pruning that could be applied for a query can vary. Next, we proposed a framework for predicting the efficiency of a query, which uses linear regression to learn a combination of aggregates of term statistics. Experiments for 10,000 queries retrieving from an in-memory index of the TREC ClueWeb09 collection (50 million documents) showed that our learned predictors encapsulating 42 features could successfully predict the response time of the state-of-the-art Wand dynamic pruning retrieval strategy.",1,TREC,True
"Moreover, we proposed the online scheduling of queries across replicated query servers, driven by predicted response times of queries. Two different scheduling architectures were proposed, differing in the location of the queueing. Simulation experiments showed not only the advantages of scheduling, but also the benefit of more accurate predicted response times within the scheduling algorithms.",1,ad,True
"We believe that there are many applications for the proposed query efficiency framework. For instance, we will investigate the application of query efficiency predictors for query routing across multi-shard indices. The efficiency predictors may also be used for controlling the efficiency/effectiveness tradeoff (e.g. achieved by diluting the top K safeness requirement or reducing the term upper bounds [5]).",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"This paper presents a different perspective on diversity in search results: diversity by proportionality. We consider a result list most diverse, with respect to some set of topics related to the query, when the number of documents it provides on each topic is proportional to the topic's popularity. Consequently, we propose a framework for optimizing proportionality for search result diversification, which is motivated by the problem of assigning seats to members of competing political parties. Our technique iteratively determines, for each position in the result ranked list, the topic that best maintains the overall proportionality. It then selects the best document on this topic for this position. We demonstrate empirically that our method significantly outperforms the top performing approach in the literature not only on our proposed metric for proportionality, but also on several standard diversity measures. This result indicates that promoting proportionality naturally leads to minimal redundancy, which is a goal of the current diversity approaches.",1,ad,True

"needs. Standard retrieval models and evaluations are based on the assumption that there is a single specific topic associated with the relevant documents for a query. Diversification models [4, 1, 26], on the other hand, identify the probable ""aspects"" of the query and return documents for each of these aspects, making the result list more diverse. Aspects denote the multiple possible intents, interpretations, or subtopics associated with a given query. By explicitly representing and providing diversity in the result list, these models can increase the likelihood that users will find documents relevant to their specific intent and thereby improve effectiveness.",0,,False
"This problem of finding a diverse ranked list of documents, with respect to the aspects of the query, has been studied primarily from the perspective of minimizing redundancy. In other words, existing work focuses on penalizing result lists with too many documents on the same aspect, which increases the redundancy of coverage, and promoting lists that contain documents covering multiple aspects. Most of the effectiveness measures for diversity [7, 8] are also based on this notion of redundancy. They penalize the redundancy in a ranked list of documents by judging each of the documents given the context of those retrieved at earlier ranks [9].",0,,False
"In this paper, we approach the same task from a different perspective. We view the problem of finding a good result list of any given size as the task of finding a representative sample of the larger set of ranked documents. Hence, the quality of the subset (a result list) should be measured by how well it represents the whole set (a much larger sample of the ranking). Using a simple (and well-worn) example, in a ranked list for a query ""java"", 90% of the documents may be about the programming language and 10% about the island. From our perspective, a result list containing ten documents where only one of them was about the island would be more representative than a result list containing five documents on each subtopic. Consequently, we treat the problem of finding a diverse result of documents as finding a proportional representation for the document ranking.",0,,False
"Finding a proportional representation is a critical part of most electoral processes. The problem is to assign a set of seats in the parliament to members of competing political parties in a way that the number of seats each party possesses is proportional to the number of votes it has received. In other words, the members in the elected parliament must be a proportional representation of these parties. If we view each position in our ranked list as a ""seat"", each aspect of the",0,,False
65,0,,False
"query as a ""party"" and the aspect popularity as the ""votes"" for this ""party"", the problem of diversification becomes very similar to this seat allocation problem.",0,,False
"Based on the above analogy, we propose a novel technique for search result diversification. It is an adaptation of the Sainte-Lagu¨e method, a standard technique for finding proportional representations that is used in the official election in New Zealand1. Generally, our technique starts with an empty ranked list of a certain size. It sequentially visits each ""seat"" in the list and determines for each of them to which aspect it should be allocated in order to maintain proportionality. Then it selects the best document for the selected aspect to occupy this ""seat"". In addition, we also present a new effectiveness measure that captures proportionality in search results. We demonstrate empirically that our method is more effective than the top performing approach in the diversity literature not only according to the proportionality measure but also using several standard metrics including -NDCG [7] and NRBP [8] that existing work has been designed to optimize. This indicates that optimizing search results for proportionality naturally leads to minimal redundancy and a diverse, effective result list.",1,ad,True
"In the next section, we briefly mention some related work. Section 3 presents our approach to proportionality and the effectiveness measure based on it. Section 4 describes in detail our proportionality-driven framework for search result diversification. Section 5 and 6 contains the experimental setup and results, as well as analyses and discussions. Finally, Section 7 concludes.",0,,False
2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
"The literature of diversification has been concentrating on the notion of novelty and redundancy. These two notions are considered under the context of user behavior with the assumption that users examine the result lists top down and eventually stop reading. Therefore, a document at any rank providing the same information as those at earlier ranks is considered redundant. Likewise, a novel document is one that provides information that has not been covered by any of the previous documents. As a result, a ranked list is considered more diverse if it contains less redundancy, or equivalently, more novelty.",1,ad,True
"This is clearly demonstrated through several standard effectiveness metrics such as -NDCG [7] and NRBP [8]. They measure the diversity of a ranked list by explicitly rewarding novelty and penalizing redundancy observed at every rank. Similarly, diversification techniques [4, 29, 1, 5, 26] attempt to form a diverse ranked list by repeatedly selecting documents that are different to those previously selected. In other words, they try to accommodate novelty at every position in the list.",0,,False
"In this paper, we present a different perspective on diversity. This view of diversity emphasizes proportionality, which is the property that the number of documents returned for each of the aspects of the query is proportional to the overall popularity of that aspect. Consequently, the framework we derive is driven by this notion of proportionality, thus is different from the existing work.",0,,False

They can be classified into two broad categories: the first concentrates on the absolute difference between the percentage of seats and the percentage of votes, the second focuses on the the ratio between them. These measures appear mathematically simple but attempt to address complex specific issues of elections that are not always relevant to our context. As a result, we apply Gallagher's Index [17], or the least square index, which is reasonably suited to our problem.",1,ad,True
"For completeness, we will provide a brief survey of techniques in the current literature of diversification. They can be classified as either implicit or explicit approaches. The former [4, 29] assumes that similar documents cover similar aspects without modelling the actual aspects. They iteratively select documents that are similar to the query but different to the previously selected documents in terms of vocabulary [4] or divergence from one language model to another [29]. More recent work [25, 22] applies the portfolio theory to document ranking, which views diversification as a mean of risk minimization. Explicit approaches [23, 1, 5, 26], on the other hand, explicitly models aspects of a query with a taxonomy [1], top retrieved documents [5] or query reformulations [23, 26] and thus can directly select documents that cover different aspects. Experimentally, explicit approaches have been demonstrated to be superior to implicit approaches [26].",0,,False

After that, we need to employ some mechanism to select the actual document with respect to ti to fill this seat. Depending on that mechanism, we then need to update the number of seats occupied by each of the aspects ti accordingly. This process repeats until we get k documents for S or we are out of candidate documents. The order in which each document is put into S determines its ranking. Assuming each document selected for ti is truly relevant to ti, the SainteLagu¨e method guarantees proportionality in the final set of documents.",0,,False

"The effectiveness of each model depends on two factors: the quality of the initial retrieved set of documents and the model's power to select a diverse subset from that pool of documents. Since all models operate on the same pool, the former factor becomes irrelevant. As for the model power, the key component of both our method and xQuAD is the query likelihood estimate of relevance P (dj|ti) between an aspect ti and a document dj. While xQuAD uses P (dj|ti) to penalize redundancy at every rank, PM-2 uses it to accommodate proportionality. Intuitively, the more accurate P (dj|ti) is at telling which document is relevant to which of the aspects of the query, the more diverse the final ranked list will be. In this experiment, we study how well these techniques perform at different level of accuracy P (dj|ti) provides.",0,,False
"In order to quantify the accuracy of P (dj|ti), we do as follows. Let D be the set of top 50 documents returned for the query q, which has a set of aspects {t1, t2, ..., tn}. We rank all documents dj  D for each of the aspects ti with P (dj|ti) and record the NDCG score. We then use the average of NDCG across all aspects as the measure of accuracy of P (dj|ti). Table 4 presents the absolute improvement each model has over the baseline (in both CPR and -NDCG separately) on different ranges of accuracy of P (dj|ti). We",0,,False
also show the number queries and how the baseline query likelihood performs in each of these ranges.,0,,False
"Since MMR does not use P (dj|ti), its performance obviously does not correlate with the accuracy of P (dj|ti). PM2 consistently provides larger improvement than xQuAD across all ranges of accuracy and metrics. In addition, the gap between the improvement in both CPR and -NDCG of PM-2 and xQuAD is generally larger as the accuracy of P (dj|ti) increases. This clearly indicates using P (dj|ti) to optimize proportionality is much more effective than to minimize redundancy, which explains the all-round superiority of PM-2.",1,ad,True
"In summary, we have demonstrated that MMR is the least effective because it helps and hurts about the same number of queries. PM-2 and xQuAD both help more queries than they hurt, but PM-2 is able to provide substantially larger improvement over the baseline than xQuAD, helping PM-2 to be statistically significantly better than xQuAD even though they both outperform MMR and the baseline. The reason for PM-2's superiority over xQuAD is that PM-2 uses P (dj|ti) to accommodate proportionality at every rank, which is more effective than using it to penalize redundancy. The results obtained with PM-2 contain not only a higher degree of proportionality but also a lower degree of redundancy.",0,,False
6.4 Failure Analysis,0,,False
"Our techniques sequentially go over all ""seats"" in the result ranked list and decide for each of them which aspect it should go to. After the aspect is determined, PM-1 simply chooses the best document for this aspect according to P (dj|ti) while PM-2 might promote documents that are slightly less relevant to this aspect but relevant to other aspects as well.",0,,False
"The problem arises when the initial retrieval fails to find relevant documents for some of the aspects. When a ""seat"" is assigned to an aspect without relevant documents, P (dj|ti) will mistakenly provide some false positive non-relevant documents to fill in that seat, leading to undesirable results. In this section, we will investigate this effect.",1,ad,True
"Sub-topic recall of the baseline run is certainly the best metric for studying the effect of coverage. Table 5 shows how different systems behave on different ranges of sub-topic recall of the top 50 documents retrieved by the baseline run. For each of the sub-topic recall ranges, Table 5 provides the percentage of queries that each system helps and hurts (marked as ""%Q+"" and ""%Q-"" respectively) together with",0,,False

"the its relative improvement (""%Imp."") in both CPR and NDCG with respect to the baseline. We also show for each range the number of queries as well as the performance of the baseline for references.",0,,False
"We first examine the percentage of queries helped and hurt by each system. At the low recall range ([0,0.5)), both PM-1 and PM-2 hurt more queries than they improve. As the recall goes up, these numbers improve. This trend is especially clear with -NDCG. This clearly demonstrates the effect sub-topic recall has on our techniques.",0,,False
"xQuAD by its nature does not have the same problem. As a result, the negative effect of low subtopic recall on xQuAD is smaller than it is on our methods: xQuAD has better Win/Loss ratios than both PM-1 and PM-2 on low ([0,0.5)) and medium ([0.5,0.75)) recall range. This helps further explain what we saw earlier in Table 2: although the same techniques perform worse on WT-2009 than they do on WT-2010, PM-1 and PM-2 are the ones with the largest performance difference in terms of Win/Loss ratio. The reason is the subtopic recall of the baseline for WT-2009 is considerably lower than that for WT-2010 (as demonstrated previously in Table 3), which affects our systems the most.",1,WT,True
"MMR despite not having this problem, it hurts about the same number of queries as our techniques in the low and medium recall ranges due to its overall ineffectiveness. In addition, it helps significantly less queries compared to ours.",1,ad,True
"With respect to the relative improvement over the baseline, even though xQuAD has better Win/Loss ratios than PM-2 on the low and medium recall ranges, PM-2 still manages to provide larger improvement than xQuAD. Additionally, the gap between the two models becomes substantially larger in the high recall range. This provides additional evidences to support the effectiveness of PM-2.",1,ad,True
"In summary, even though our proportionality-aware method PM-2 is very effective overall, it depends critically on the coverage of the baseline run.",0,,False
6.5 Discussion: On Noisy Aspect Descriptions,0,,False
"Given that automatically generated aspects can be helpful for diversification, it is important to know how to generate them. Using query suggestions from commercial search engines in effect is using a ""black box"" for this important component. Hence, this section aims to provide a preliminary discussion on whether we can use aspects generated by existing work in query suggestion and reformulation for diversification.",0,,False
"While most of those reformulation techniques focus on making user queries more effective [2, 18, 24, 20, 15], some aim to generate reformulations that cover different aspects of the original query [16]. We have adapted these techniques [16] to generate a set of clusters for each of our queries, where each cluster is assumed to represent an aspect of the original query. Details can be found in [16]. We concatenate all queries in each cluster to form a ""document"", from which we then construct a language model. Finally, we use Indri's weighted query representation of this model as the aspect description and the frequency of the cluster as the popularity of the aspect. The resulting query set consists of 77 queries for which the reformulation technique can provide clusters.",1,ad,True
"We now re-evaluate all of our techniques using this set of aspects. The results are presented in Table 6. Interestingly, we observe that the performance of xQuAD, PM-1 and PM2 is substantially lower than with the previous two aspect",0,,False
"sets. We observe that this set of aspects, in comparison with the set obtained from the search engine, contains (1) considerably less of the TREC sub-topics and more of other aspects that are not identified by TREC's assesors, and also (2) some unclear aspect descriptions. The low performance of all systems, in fact, clearly demonstrates the aspect misalignment issue and the noisiness of this set.",1,TREC,True
"With these noisy aspects, PM-2 is still better than xQuAD with most of the metrics. The performance of xQuAD is, in fact, even lower than that of the query likelihood baseline in both CPR and -NDCG. PM-2 still manages to provide improvement, but it is more comparable to MMR. Interestingly, PM-1 is now the best performing approach.",0,,False
"To conclude, aspects generated by the current query reformulation technique are generally not very ""effective"" for diversification. This notion of ""effectiveness"", however, has to be taken with care. We have been penalizing all systems for finding documents for aspects that are different to TREC sub-topics. In practice, these unjudged aspects might be relevant to the query as well. This raises the question of how reliable the current evaluation paradigm is that relies on pre-defining a fixed set of aspects for each queries. We will investigate this issue in future work.",1,TREC,True
7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK,0,,False
"In this paper, we present a different perspective on search result diversification: diversity by proportionality. We consider a result list to be more diverse if the number of documents relevant to each of the aspects is proportional to the overall popularity of that aspect. We then propose Cumulative Proportionality (CPR), an effectiveness measure for proportionality which is based on metrics commonly used for evaluating outcomes of elections. Motivated by the Sainte-Lagu¨e method for assigning seats in a parliament to members of competing political parties, we also present a proportionality-driven framework for diversification. It sequentially determines for each of the ""seats"" in the result list the aspect that best maintains the overall proportionality with respect to the previously selected topics. It then determines for this seat the best document with respect to that topic. Using this framework, we derive PM-1 ­ a naive adaptation of the seat allocation mechanism, from which we then develop the probabilistic interpretation, which we called PM-2.",1,ad,True
"Our results have demonstrated that, with both manually and automatically generated aspect descriptions, PM-2 is statistically significantly better than the top performing redundancy-based technique not only in CPR, but also on several other standard redundancy-based measures. This indicates that promoting proportionality will result in minimal redundancy, as desired by the current standard in diversity.",0,,False
"For future work, we will compare the aspects generated by existing reformulation techniques to the TREC sub-topics in order to quantify the aspect misalignment problem. If many of these misaligned aspects are indeed sensible, we might have to re-examine if predefining a set of topics for each query is a valid strategy for evaluating diversification techniques. In addition, Santos et al. has pointed out that learning to dynamically provide different diversification strategies for different queries based on how ambiguous they are [27] and what intent they have [28] significantly improves the performance of xQuAD. We plan to investigate these approaches since they are potentially beneficial for our model.",1,TREC,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"The intent-oriented search diversification methods developed in the field so far tend to build on generative views of the retrieval system to be diversified. Core algorithm components ­in particular redundancy assessment­ are expressed in terms of the probability to observe documents, rather than the probability that the documents be relevant. This has been sometimes described as a view considering the selection of a single document in the underlying task model. In this paper we propose an alternative formulation of aspect-based diversification algorithms which explicitly includes a formal relevance model. We develop means for the effective computation of the new formulation, and we test the resulting algorithm empirically. We report experiments on search and recommendation tasks showing competitive or better performance than the original diversification algorithms. The relevancebased formulation has further interesting properties, such as unifying two well-known state of the art algorithms into a single version. The relevance-based approach opens alternative possibilities for further formal connections and developments as natural extensions of the framework. We illustrate this by modeling tolerance to redundancy as an explicit configurable parameter, which can be set to better suit the characteristics of the IR task, or the evaluation metrics, as we illustrate empirically.",0,,False

"The value of diversity as a fundamental dimension of information utility has started to be cared for in the Information Retrieval (IR) research community for over a decade [4]. Diversity-enhancement methods have been developed [1,7,21,27,29], diversity evaluation methodologies and metrics have been proposed [1,8,24,29], and a",1,ad,True

"diversity task has been included in the latest TREC campaigns [9]. Theories of IR diversity build on a revision of the classic document independence assumption in IR: the marginal utility of a document indeed highly depends on ­in general, decreases with­ the relevance of the documents the user has previously seen. Considering this, IR systems' output diversification is posited as an effective strategy to cope with the uncertainty (ambiguity and/or incompleteness) involved in user queries, as imperfect expressions of true user needs. By trading diminishing marginal relevance for increased query aspect coverage, diversification strategies seek to maximize the range of users (the precise potential intents behind the query) who will get at least some relevant document, thereby improving the overall gain [1,7,10,21].",1,TREC,True
"Two trends can be broadly distinguished in the diversification methods reported in the literature, based on whether or not they use an explicit representation of query intents [22]. Whereas intent-oriented methods include an explicit query aspect space in their formulation, implicit diversification schemes typically rely at some level on inter-document similarity, under the assumption that dissimilar documents should cover diverse query aspects. Interestingly, intent-implicit approaches generally build ­as far as their formalization goes­ on an explicit relevance model, often lending from the Probability Ranking Principle [7,27,29]. Whereas, in contrast, the intent-explicit methods tend to elaborate, in their problem statement, formalization, and algorithmic formulation, on generative views of the retrieval system to be diversified, where relevance is implicit [1,21,25]. Core algorithm components ­in particular redundancy assessment­ are expressed in such approaches in terms of the probability to observe documents, rather than the probability that the documents be relevant. This has been sometimes described as a view considering the selection of a single document in the underlying task model [28].",1,ad,True
"In this paper we propose an alternative formulation of aspectbased diversification algorithms which explicitly includes a formal relevance model. Our research has a theoretical motivation in seeking an alternative, nuanced understanding of the intentexplicit diversity problem, and the resulting variants in the formulation and development of aspect-based diversification methods. On the other hand, the explicit relevance approach has advantages of its own. We report experiments in search and recommendation tasks where the approach shows competitive or better performance than its original counterparts. Moreover, the relevancebased formulation opens the way for further extensions and elaborations with models involving an explicit representation of relevance. As a particular case, we show that the framework provides a sound basis for tuning redundancy penalization in a principled way, as a smooth consistent extension of the diversity model.",1,ad,True

"The different views on relevance implied by the Probability Ranking Principle (PRP) [20] and the Language Modeling (LM) approaches to IR [16] raised interest and debate in the research community by the turn of the past decade [23]. The absence of a clear explicit notion of relevance in the early LM formulations has been often considered to involve an underlying assumption of single relevant document selection [3]. Even though ­or precisely because­ there does not seem to be a unique common understanding on such issues in the field, and a unique view on whether or how LM actually capture relevance, we see theoretical ­and potentially practical­ interest in exploring new formulations of the diversity problem ­and the derivation of algorithms thereupon­ which explicitly build on the probability of relevance.",1,LM,True
"As stated in the introduction, we focus on approaches to diversity which are founded on an explicit representation of query intents. As two prototypical representative instances of this approach, we focus on IA-Select [1] and xQuAD [21] as the algorithms of reference for our study. Both have proved to be quite effective in IR diversity tasks, outperforming prior non-explicitly intentoriented approaches (see [22] for a comprehensive empirical analysis and comparisons). We start by briefly reviewing the formulation of these diversification schemes, and the fundamental principles on which they build, in order to contrast them later to a relevance-based alternative.",0,,False

We do not apply an exhaustive optimization or tuning of the diversifiers, since the goal of the experiment is the comparison of alternatives, rather than reaching the maximum performance possible. To this respect, our results are roughly comparable in range to those reported e.g. in [21]. With ODP categories, we use the Textwise4 classification service to estimate ( | ), by normalization of the score returned by the classifier. For TREC subtopics, we derive an estimate by submitting them as queries to the baseline search system, as discussed earlier in section 3.3.

6. DISCUSSION,0,,False
"In practical terms, using a relevance model in the redundancy component results in a higher redundancy penalization than is applied with a document generation model in xQuAD, as discussed in the previous section. Adding to one over all documents, the variations of ( | ) are quite small compared to ( | ), whereby subtopic coverage may tend to overdo redundancy in the overall effect of the algorithm. In contrast, the conditional Bernoulli relevance distribution ( | , , ) does not add to one in general over documents (unless the model assumes a unique relevant document), and may thus range over a significantly higher scale. Our relevance-oriented formulation hence enables a stronger redundancy penalization. This strength can be softened if needed, by the generalization for redundancy adaptation described in the previous section.",1,ad,True
"Compared to the original xQuAD, IA-Select goes to the opposite extreme in redundancy penalization: according to the approach described by Agrawal et al [1], redundancy is penalized by",0,,False
"( | ), which may have values close to 1 when documents cover a single aspect with high probability. The effect is that once an aspect is covered by some document in , any other document covering this aspect is considered to add near zero marginal utility [28]. As a particular consequence, there is little discrimination between degrees of redundancy (i.e. an aspect that has been covered just once vs. further times before), and once all aspects have been covered, the diversified ranking degrades to the original order defined by the baseline retrieval system (see [26] for further analysis). Our relevance-oriented formulation does not result in such extremes either, as far as the probability of relevance, even at the high rank positions does usually not get as close to 1 as ( | ) may get. In practice, IA-Select may also soften the penalization by multiplying ( | ) by the baseline retrieval function. The penalization is also milder when documents cover several aspects, in which case ( | ) ranges over lower values. The algorithm implementation designer has no explicit control over these factors though ­in contrast with our proposed extension for redundancy adjustment­, which may also account for the instability of IASelect across heterogeneous experiments observed in section 4.",1,ad,True
"Besides these considerations, a relevance-based redundancy assessment better matches the structure of redundancy-sensitive",0,,False
"metrics such has ERR-IA and -nDCG, which are formalized in terms of probabilities of relevance [8]. This may partly account for the observed improved performance. The introduction of an explicit redundancy control parameter allows further gauging how aggressive the novelty-seeking component should be, enabling a finer adjustment to the role of redundancy in specific IR tasks and metrics.",1,ad,True
"Modeling tolerance to redundancy illustrates the potential advantages that an explicit relevance model brings about. Tolerance to redundancy could be introduced in the original formulations of IA-Select and xQuAD as well e.g. as a scalar parameter in the redundancy penalization component, but it is not clear how this might be given a principled ­not simply heuristic­ justification. As noted by Welch et al [28], ""common to a majority of prior research [on search diversification] is the single relevant document assumption"", which makes it difficult to explicitly formalize variable degrees of acceptable redundancy. The lack of this limitation might be credited as a virtue of an explicit relevance model. Though it has also been argued that a document generative model does not intrinsically negate the selection of several relevant documents [16], it is not clear how this multiple selection could be explicitly reflected upon a generative model. Welch et al [28]",1,ad,True
"actually address this by explicitly modeling the number of relevant documents that the user is seeking to get. The alternative we show here has a considerably simpler development and does not require the introduction of this additional, somewhat artificial variable (the number of sought documents). Instead, our approach builds on models of user behavior, which are being extensively researched in the field (e.g. [8,15] among many other works).",1,ad,True
"A tradeoff of the relevance model is that it needs to be trained on relevance information ­a tradeoff which is shared with PRP approaches in contrast to language modeling to build information retrieval systems. We have shown however that the need for training in our framework is not demanding in terms of the involved complexity, the data requirements, or the required accuracy, since a simple approach with few data proves to be good enough to produce quite competitive results. Furthermore, a rough rank-relevance estimate from a commercial search engine click log showed to be sufficient to obtain almost as good results as with expensive editorial relevance judgments.",1,ad,True
7. CONCLUSION,0,,False
"IR diversification approaches proposed so far in the field use either an explicit representation of information need aspects, or an explicit relevance model, but not both. We have proposed and developed a revision of prior intent-oriented diversification schemes with the introduction of an explicit relevance model in the formulation of the approach. We observe that an explicit relevance model results in comparable or even better performance than prior approaches in terms of diversity evaluation metrics, in different application domains (search and recommendation) on different datasets. The approach thus favorably compares to its original alternatives, and might open new lines for effectiveness improvements.",0,,False
"From a theoretical standpoint, the relevance-oriented formulation provides an alternative ­perhaps more direct­ description of the diversity problem, whereupon the algorithmic scheme can be directly derived. The relevance-based foundation may be better suited for the description of diversification processes and their underlying principles: marginal utility, diminishing returns, relative value of documents, and so forth. Concepts such as relevance and utility find clear, unambiguous and more direct reflection in the framework itself. Furthermore, the formulation provides a more direct match of metric schemes in which relevance models underlie [5,8,15,24], therefore potentially providing for a better optimization against such metrics.",0,,False
"An additional side-effect of the relevance-oriented formulation is the unification of the IA-Select and xQuAD approaches into a common scheme. The proposed framework opens moreover new directions for further formal developments where relevance is an intrinsic variable. As a particular case, we show the formal extension of our framework to describe and adjust the algorithm to different degrees of tolerance to redundancy, the consistency of which is empirically validated.",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"In this paper, we propose a novel top-k learning to rank framework, which involves labeling strategy, ranking model and evaluation measure. The motivation comes from the difficulty in obtaining reliable relevance judgments from human assessors when applying learning to rank in real search systems. The traditional absolute relevance judgment method is difficult in both gradation specification and human assessing, resulting in high level of disagreement on judgments. While the pairwise preference judgment, as a good alternative, is often criticized for increasing the complexity of judgment from O(n) to O(n log n). Considering the fact that users mainly care about top ranked search results, we propose a novel top-k labeling strategy which adopts the pairwise preference judgment to generate the top k ordering items from n documents (i.e. top-k ground-truth) in a manner similar to that of HeapSort. As a result, the complexity of judgment is reduced to O(n log k). With the topk ground-truth, traditional ranking models (e.g. pairwise or listwise models) and evaluation measures (e.g. NDCG) no longer fit the data set. Therefore, we introduce a new ranking model, namely FocusedRank, which fully captures the characteristics of the top-k ground-truth. We also extend the widely used evaluation measures NDCG and ERR to be applicable to the top-k ground-truth, referred as -NDCG and -ERR, respectively. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark data collections to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our top-k labeling strategy and ranking models.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"In the past few years, learning to rank has been widely recognized as an important technique for information retrieval (IR). A vital part to employ learning to rank in real search systems is the acquisition of reliable and high quality labeled datasets, both for training and evaluation. In traditional IR literature, assessors are requested to determine the relevance of a document under some pre-defined gradations, which is called absolute relevance judgment method. However, there are some significant drawbacks for this evaluation process. Firstly, the specifics of the gradations (i.e. how many grades to use and what those grades mean) must be defined, and it is not clear how these choices will affect relative performance measurements [26]. Secondly, the assessing burden increases with the complexity of the relevance gradations; the choice of label is not clear when there are more factors to consider, leading to high level of disagreement on judgments [4].",1,ad,True
"Recently pairwise preference judgment has been investigated as a good alternative [20, 26]. Instead of assigning a relevance grade to a document, an assessor looks at two pages and judges which one is better. Compared with absolute relevance judgment, the advantages lie in that: (1) There is no need to determine the gradation specifications as it is a binary decision. (2) It is easier for an assessor to express a preference for one document over the other than to assign a pre-defined grade to each of them [7]. (3) Most state-of-the-art learning to rank models, pairwise or listwise, are trained over preferences. As noted by Carterette et al. [7], ""by collecting preferences directly, some of the noise associated with difficulty in distinguishing between different levels of relevance may be reduced."" Although preference judgment likely produce more reliable labeled data, it is often criticized for increasing the complexity of judgment (e.g. from O(n) to O(n log n) [20]), which poses a big challenge in wide use. Do we actually need to judge so many pairs for real search systems? If not, which pairs do we choose? How to choose? These questions become the original motivation of this paper.",1,ad,True
"As we know, in real Web search scenario, it is well accepted that users mainly care about the top results [30]. In other words, the ordering of the top results (typically the results on the first one or two pages) is critical for users' search experience. It indicates that a labeling strategy shall take effort to figure out the top results and judge the preference orders among them, but pay less attention to the exact",0,,False
751,0,,False
"preference orders among the rest results. Based on this observation, we propose a novel top-k labeling strategy which adopts the pairwise preference judgment to generate the top k ordering items from a set of n items in a manner similar to that of HeapSort. The obtained ground-truth from this topk labeling strategy is a mixture of the total order of the top k items, and the relative preferences between the set of top k items and the set of the rest n - k items, referred as topk ground-truth. With this top-k labeling strategy, we can not only capture enough information for learning to rank [30], but also largely reduce the complexity of judgment to O(n log k).",1,ad,True
"With top-k ground-truth, we find that traditional ranking models, either pairwise or listwise, are no longer suitable for the labeled data set. It is natural to introduce a mixed ranking model, with the listwise model capturing the total order of the top k items and the pairwise model capturing the relative preference between the set of top k items and the set of the rest n - k items. Such a mixed model can thus combine the advantages of both pairwise and listwise approaches to fully exploit the information in the top-k ground-truth. We refer such a mixed ranking model as FocusedRank, since it emphasizes more on the ordering of the top items.",1,ad,True
"For evaluation, traditional IR evaluation measures (e.g., MAP, NDCG and ERR), which are mainly defined on the absolute judgment, cannot be directly applied to the top-k ground-truth. To address this problem, we extend NDCG and ERR to -NDCG and -ERR by taking a function of the position of items as the absolute relevance label. The proposed evaluation measures thus emphasize the importance of the ordering of the top k items. Unlike the evaluation measures based on preference judgments [6], -NDCG and -ERR keep the same form as NDCG and ERR thus enjoy all the merits of traditional IR evaluation measures.",1,ad,True
"Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark data collections. Major experimental findings include: (1) With top-k labeling strategy, the time cost on labeling one pair is much less than that on one item in absolute relevance judgment, and the overall time cost is comparable with that in absolute relevance judgment.

2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
"In this section, we briefly review some related work on labeling strategy, ranking model and evaluation measure in learning to rank literature.",0,,False
2.1 Labeling Strategy,0,,False
"In learning to rank, labeling strategies can be divided into two categories: absolute judgment and relative judgment [21, 26, 32, 7].",0,,False
"In absolute judgment, assessors are usually requested to assign a graded score to an item independent of the other items [15, 4, 27, 28, 29] under some pre-defined gradations. Such a labeling strategy has been widely adopted in both industry and academia to construct benchmark datasets in IR, e.g. TREC data sets (since 2000), Microsoft learning to rank datasets [18] and Yahoo! Learning to Rank challenge 2010 data set. One difficult problem in using absolute judgment is to clearly define the specifics of the gradations, i.e. how many grades to use and what those grades mean. Some previous studies tried to figure out the proper number of relevance gradations [22, 19]. However, as noted by Cox [12], ""there is no single number of response alternatives for a scale which is appropriate under all circumstances"". If the descriptions of each degree are not clearly defined, a multi-grade judgment method can be easily misused in the evaluation process [34]. Moreover, the assessing burden in absolute judgment increases with the complexity of the relevance gradations. When there are more factors to consider, the choice of label is not clear, resulting in high level of disagreement on judgments [4].",1,ad,True
"In contrast, relative judgement aims to directly judge the relative order of a set of items [26]. As a typical form of relative judgment, pairwise preference judgment asks assessors to express a preference for one item over the other [6]. One concern of using this strategy is the complexity of judgment since the number of item pairs is polynomial in the number of items. Carterette et al. [7] attempted to reduce the number of pairs for judging by using transitivity of relevance among documents. Nir Ailon [1] proposed a formal pairwise method based on QuickSort which can reduce the number of preference judgments from O(n2) to O(n log n). Compared with O(n) in absolute judgment, this is still not affordable for assessors. To increase the efficiency of relative judgment, R. Song et al. [26] further proposed to select the best one each time from the remaining items, which is only applicable to small datasets. Different from the above related work, we propose a novel top-k labeling strategy to largely save the effort of preference judgment, by exploiting what Web search users actually care about on ranking.",0,,False
2.2 Ranking Model,0,,False
"So far learning to rank has been mainly addressed by pointwise, pairwise, and listwise ranking models. In pointwise models [17], ranking is transformed to regression or classification on individual items to represent the absolute label on each item. In pairwise models [14, 11, 3], ranking is transformed to classification on item pairs to represent the",1,ad,True
752,0,,False
"preference between two items. In listwise models [33, 31, 5], instances as document lists are generated through the comparison over item pairs, and it is superior in modeling more discriminative judgments. Therefore, we can conclude that, pointwise models is well suited for absolute relevance judgment; while both pairwise and listwise models are applicable in either absolute or relative judgment scenario.",0,,False
"In previous work [30], Xia et al. extended three listwise ranking models, namely top-k ListMLE, top-k ListNet and top-k RankCosine, to fit the top-k scenario. Note that they addressed this scenario under the circumstances of traditional labeling strategy and evaluation measure. They conducted experiments on the top-k ListMLE, and claimed that the top-k ListMLE can outperform traditional pairwise and listwise ranking models. However, it cannot avoid the computational complexity on the entire permutation such as that in top-k ListNet.",1,ad,True
"In our paper, we take the above ranking models as the baselines to show the superiority of FocusedRank.",0,,False
2.3 Evaluation Measure,0,,False
"To evaluate the effectiveness of a ranking model, many IR measures have been proposed. Here we give a brief introduction to several popular ones which are widely used in learning to rank. See also [16] for other measures.",0,,False
"Precision@k [2] is a measure for evaluating top k positions of a ranked list using two grades (relevant and irrelevant) of relevance judgment. With Precision as the basis, Average Precision (AP) and Mean Average Precision (MAP) [2] are derived to evaluate the average performance of a ranking model.",1,ad,True
"While Precision considers only two graded relevance judgments, Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [13] is an evaluation measure that can leverage the relevance judgment in terms of multiple ordered categories, and has an explicit position discount factor in its definition. By normalizing DCG@k with its maximum possible value, we will get another popular measure named Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain (NDCG).",1,ad,True
"To relax the additive nature and the underlying independence assumption in NDCG, another evaluation measure, Expected Reciprocal Rank (ERR), is proposed in [8]. It implicitly discounts documents which are shown below very relevant documents, and is defined as the expected reciprocal length of time that the user will take to find a relevant document.",1,ad,True
"Although MAP, NDCG and ERR are widely used in IR, they all adopt absolute relevance labels in their formulation, which imposes restrictions on direct application in the scenario of relative judgment. Therefore, new measures such as bpref , ppref , and nwppref [6] have been proposed. However, these measures have not been widely accepted by IR community. In this paper, we extend traditional IR evaluation measures to our relative judgment scenario with similar formulation.",1,MAP,True

3.1 Top-k Labeling Strategy,0,,False
"According to previous work and the above discussions,",0,,False
"pairwise preference judgment is superior to traditional absolute relevance judgment in the acquisition of reliable judgments from human assessors. However, it is often criticized for increasing the complexity of judgment. In this section, we propose a novel top-k labeling strategy by exploiting what Web search users actually care about on ranking. Our labeling strategy can not only capture enough information for learning to rank, but also largely save the effort of preference judgment.",1,ad,True
3.1.1 Motivation,0,,False
"In real Web search applications, users usually pay more attention to the top-k items [9, 25, 10]. For example, according to a user study [30], in modern search engines, about 62% of search users only click on the results within the first pages, and 90% of search users click on the results within the first three pages. It shows that the ordering of the top k results is critical for users' search experience. Two ranked lists of results will likely provide the same value to users (and thus suffer the same loss), if they have the same ranking results for the top positions [30]. Moreover, a good ranking on the top results is much more important than a good ranking on the others. Therefore, a labeling strategy shall take effort to figure out the top k results, judge the preference orders among them carefully, but pay less attention to the exact preference orders among the rest results.",0,,False
3.1.2 Labeling Strategy,0,,False
"Based on the above analysis, we propose a novel top-k labeling strategy using the pairwise preference judgment as the basis. The basic assumption for our labeling strategy is the transitivity of preference judgments of relevance [24, 7]. That is, if i is preferred to j and j is preferred to k, the assessor will also prefers i to k. With this assumption, our labeling strategy generate the top k ordering items from a set of n items in a manner similar to that of HeapSort. It mainly takes the following three steps:",0,,False
"Step1 Randomly select k items from the set of n items and build a min-heap with t as the root based on the pairwise preference judgments by assessors. Here a min-heap is a complete binary tree with the property: if B is a child node of A, A is less relevant than B.",0,,False
Step2 Randomly select an item r from the rest n - k items and the preference judgement is conducted between t and r by assessors. We then update the heap if necessary and obtain a new min-heap with the k most relevant items up till now. It is repeated until all the items have been selected.,0,,False
"Step3 Sort the final k items in the min-heap in a descending order, and append the rest items after the k items.",0,,False
"The detailed labeling algorithm is shown in Algorithm1. With the above top-k labeling strategy, the obtained groundtruth is a mixture of the total order of the top k items and the relative preference between the set of top k items and the set of the rest n - k items, referred to as top-k ground-truth.",0,,False

"Therefore, the total judgment complexity of top-k labeling strategy is about O(n log k). Compared with QuickSort strategy adopted by Nir Ailon [1] for preference judgment, our top-k labeling strategy significantly reduces the complexity from O(n log n) to O(n log k), where usually k n. The judgment complexity of our strategy is nearly comparable with that of the absolute judgment (i.e. O(n)). Experimental results in the following section also verify the efficiency of our labeling strategy which is consistent with the theoretical analysis.",1,ad,True
3.2 Top-k Ranking Model,0,,False
"With the top-k ground-truth obtained from our labeling method, traditional ranking models no longer fit the labeled dataset. On one hand, pairwise ranking models can capture the information of the relative preference, but fail to model the total order of the top k items since they ignore the position information. On the other hand, listwise ranking models can capture the information of the total order, but suffer from the great computational complexity due to a large undifferentiated item set in top-k ground-truth. To address this problem, we propose FocusedRank, a mixed ranking model with listwise ranking model capturing the total order of the top k items and pairwise ranking model capturing the relative preference between the set of top k items and the set of the rest n - k items. Such a mixed model can thus combine the advantages of both pairwise and listwise approaches to fully exploit the information in the top-k ground-truth.",1,ad,True

In T 2, a query with its description is shown at the top followed with five grade buttons, and a Web page is placed at the main area. An assessor is asked to decide which grade should be assigned to that page. A timer is introduced to both tools for computing time per judgment.

Secondly, for each assessor, he/she is most likely to memorize some information on the documents for a given query after judging. Therefore, to compare the methods independently, we shall ensure that each assessor will not see the same query under different tools to minimize the possible order effect.

Two basic metrics are utilized to evaluate the labeling strategies.,0,,False
"(1) Time efficiency: Time efficiency [26] is used to measure the cost of labeling. It is dependent on the time per judgment and the complexity of judgment (the total number of judgments for each query). Statistically, less time per judgment suggests easier judgment.",0,,False
"(2) Agreement: Here we measure the agreement between two assessors over all judgments as [7] to average out differences in expertise, prior knowledge, or understanding of the query. For comparison, we inferred preferences from the absolute judgements: if the judgment on item A was greater than the judgment on item B, we inferred that A was preferred to B (denoted by A B). A tie between A and B is denoted by AB.",0,,False
"As shown in Table 1, it is obvious that the average time per judgment in absolute judgments is longer than that of the preference judgments in top-k labeling strategy, e.g. about 2  3 times. The results verifies the common sense that the preference judgment is easier than absolute judgment. Meanwhile, from the average number of judgments conducted on each query, we can find that the top-k labeling strategy will take more judgments than the absolute judgments, at a scale around the theoretical value log k (i.e. k,""10). Most importantly, we can see that the total judgment time spent on each query is comparable between the two methods. The results indicate that by adopting the top-k labeling strategy, the complexity of pairwise preference judgment becomes similar to that of the absolute judgment. Therefore, it is feasible to use top-k labeling in practice.""",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Question recommendation that automatically recommends a new question to suitable users to answer is an appealing and challenging problem in the research area of Community Question Answering (CQA). Unlike in general recommender systems where a user has only a single role, each user in CQA can play two different roles (dual roles) simultaneously: as an asker and as an answerer. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to systematically investigate the distinctions between the two roles and their different influences on the performance of question recommendation in CQA. Moreover, we propose a Dual Role Model (DRM) to model the dual roles of users effectively. With different independence assumptions, two variants of DRM are achieved. Finally, we present the DRM based approach to question recommendation which provides a mechanism for naturally integrating the user relation between the answerer and the asker with the content relevance between the answerer and the question into a unified probabilistic framework. Experiments using a real-world data crawled from Yahoo! Answers show that: (1) there are evident distinctions between the two roles of users in CQA. Additionally, the answerer role is more effective than the asker role for modeling candidate users in question recommendation; (2) compared with baselines utilizing a single role or blended roles based methods, our DRM based approach consistently and significantly improves the performance of question recommendation, demonstrating that our approach can model the user in CQA more reasonably and precisely.",1,Yahoo,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Community Question Aswering (CQA) is a web service where people can seek information (posting a question and getting the answer of it from others) and share knowledge (answering a question). Yahoo! Answers1 and Baidu Zhidao2 are two typical examples of CQA system. Compared with the traditional information retrieval, CQA bases on the community, which is a form of social network, so it can make best of user's collective wisdom to meet the information needs of users more easily and accurately.",1,Yahoo,True
"In CQA system, there are a large number of questions posted every day. Take Yahoo! Answers for example, there are about 207 thousands new questions asked daily [1]. If we can automatically recommend the new question to appropriate users to answer, it will help the question be resolved as soon as possible, which will improve the CQA system's performance. In addition, it will meet the answerers' needs to answer questions. As we can see, question recommendation is a very important component in a CQA system.",1,Yahoo,True
"The core issue of question recommendation is how to represent the users' interests (profile) and the questions, which is called the representation model. Based on that, we can assess the match between a question and each user, and then recommend the question to top N users who are the most consistent with it. Of course, we can solve question recommendation from another perspective, which is matching a user with each question and recommending the appropriate questions to him. Both of these types of recommendation tasks aim to make new questions answered as early as possible and satisfy the user better. Essentially, the key issues of both of them are the representation models for users and questions. As our target is recommending a new question to the appropriate users to answer, this paper focuses on the first type of recommendation task. At present, a lot of representation models have been proposed. Dror et al [5] represented the user and question as vectors consisting of multi-channel features and casted question recommendation as a classification problem. Other methods [2, 4, 6] utilized latent semantic models (PLSA, LDA, etc.) to model the user and question as the distribution of several topics.",0,,False
"As we can see, each user in CQA plays two different roles (dual roles) simultaneously: the asker and the answerer. That is, a user not only posts his questions, but also is able to answer someone else's questions. Intuitively, the profiles of the two roles of users are different from each other, which existing methods have not paid attention to. For example, a piano teacher wants to learn some computer knowledge which he is not familiar with. Thus he is most likely to ask lots of questions related to computer, and answer many piano-related questions based on his specialty. As an asker, a user may post some questions in",0,,False

"the field that he is not familiar with. In contrast, as an answer, the user will solve the question which he is good at and interested in.",0,,False
"Are there distinctions between users' roles? How do different roles affect the performance of question recommendation? Whether we can legitimately combine the characteristics of different roles to improve the effectiveness of the recommendation system? All of these important issues are worthy of our concern. However, current recommendation methods have not in-depth studied the different characteristics of users' roles and their different influences on question recommendation. All of previous methods only modeled the user using a single role, or simply mixed the two roles together to represent the user without considering the distinctions between roles.",0,,False
"This paper systematically investigates the distinctions between users' dual roles and how they affect the performance of question recommendation differently. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on studying these important issues. While Nam et al. [30] observed that users in CQA are divided into askers and answerers and only a few of them both ask and answer in the same category through statistics, they have not theoretically analyzed the distinctions between users' different roles and their different influences on question recommendation. Moreover, we propose the Dual Role Model (DRM) to model the dual roles of users effectively. Finally, we present the DRM based approach to question recommendation, which takes full advantage of users' different roles to improve the effect of question recommendation. There are three primary contributions of our work.",1,ad,True
"First, DRM which considers the two different roles of users separately provides a more precise and appropriate user representation model for question recommendation in CQA. Specifically, we utilize DRM to analyze the latent topic information of different roles for modeling the user. According to different independence assumptions, two variants of DRM are achieved: (1) independent DRM that assumes that users are independent of each other and models each user individually; (2) dependent DRM which considers the dependence between users.",0,,False
"Next, we carried out systematic experiments on a real-world data to explore the distinctions between users' roles and compare the effects of recommendation methods that are based on asker role, answerer role or blending both of these roles. The results show that not only the two roles but also their influences on question recommendation are different from each other distinctly. In addition, simply mixing the roles together will impair the performance of recommender methods.",1,ad,True
"Finally, our DRM based recommendation approach allows us to naturally integrate the user relation between the answerer and the asker with the content relevance between the answerer and the question into a unified probabilistic framework, which is more interpretable. Most previous methods only consider the content relevance. There have been several approaches that make use of the user relation [3, 5], however in these approaches, the user relation is either obtained through somewhat heuristic statistics outside of the model or combined with the content relevance by a linear interpolation.",0,,False
"The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces some prior work related to our approach. Section 3 is the preliminary description of question recommendation in CQA. Section 4 discusses our dual role model and how to use it in question recommendation. Experimental results are presented in Section 5. At last, we conclude the paper and discuss about the future work in Section 6.",0,,False
2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
"In this part, we review previous work which is related to our approach: recommender system, question recommendation.",0,,False
2.1 Recommender System,0,,False
"Because question recommendation is a type of recommender system, we first review general recommender systems. Recommender systems can be divided into three stages based on how recommendations are made: content-based recommendations, collaborative filtering and hybrid approaches [18]. In contentbased recommendations, the user will be recommended items similar to the ones the user preferred in the past. In collaborative filtering, the user will be recommended items that people with the similar tastes and preferences liked in the past, that is, user will help each other find what they may like. In order to combine the advantage of both previous methods together, hybrid approaches are proposed. All these recommender systems firstly attempt to profile user preferences based on his history logs, and then recommend items according to the relevancy between him and items. Different kinds of methods are used to capture the model of users, such as classifying [24, 28], PLSA [13], matrix factorization [29], and ranking-oriented approach [17]. However, the user in these general recommender systems only plays one single role, which is significantly different from question recommendation. Therefore, we should pay close attention to this difference as we have mentioned in the above section.",1,ad,True
2.2 Question Recommendation,0,,False
"With CQA system becoming popular in recent years, many people turn their attention to question recommendation in CQA, e.g., [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 16]. Overall, there are two main lines to solve this problem in previous work.",0,,False
"On one hand, question recommendation is consider as a classifier problem which is similar to [5]. In [5], Dror et al. proposed a representation model based on multi-channel vector space model, where the user and question are represented as the vector with multiple dimension features from multi-channel data. Then, the matching degree between a user and a question is learned from their respective features using a binary classifier. Although this model treats user attributes in the answered-channel and askedchannel as two groups of features respectively, all the features are integrated into a single vector space model to represent the user's dual roles without considering the distinctions between user's different roles and their different influences on question recommendation.",0,,False
"On the other hand, we can learn a ranking model to generate a recommendation list for question recommendation. In these earlier works, various extensions of Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) or other topic models are developed. Wu et al. [2] presented an incremental automatic question recommendation framework based on PLSA. Question recommendation in their work considered both the users' interests and feedback. Guo et al. [4] developed a general generative model based on basic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model for questions and answers in CQA. In this approach, they combined topic-level information about questions and users with word-level information to improve question recommendation. In order to deal with the data sparsity, Qu et al. [6] used a user-word aspect model instead of direct aspect model [9] to model user preferences. However, all of these methods have used a single role, or simply blended roles to represent the user, which have not distinguished user's different roles and considered how they affect the performance of question recommendation differently.",1,ad,True

"We first compare the performances of different roles in each baseline group. From Table 5, we observe that the answerer role always wins the best result in all baseline groups across data subsets.

When data sets become denser and denser from User-10 to User-20, the effect of the answerer role becomes better and better as we expect. On the contrary, the result of the asker role appears an unexpected decrease in User-20. Furthermore, we examine the recommendation results of blended roles. As we can see, simply mixing the asker role into the answerer role not only fails to improve but worsens recommendation results of answerer role instead. According to above experiments, we conclude that different user roles reflect the different aspects of the user, moreover, there are clear distinctions between their influences on question recommendation. When modeling the user in CQA, we must distinguish the different user roles. When recommending new questions to users, it would be more appropriate to use the answerer role model to represent the candidate users.",1,ad,True

In addition, DDRM is significantly better than IDRM across data sets, which means considering the dependence between uses is more effective to model user roles. This result is also consistent with the above role analysis.",1,ad,True
"Another interesting result to note is that the PLSA1 which models the user indirectly is almost equivalent to PLSA2 which models the user directly on three data subsets, suggesting that it is feasible to model the user indirectly by combining the topic information questions that he accesses. Additionally, it is clear that all methods based on latent topic analysis (PLSA1, PLSA2, and DRM) always perform better than word-level VSM, which demonstrates that the latent topic based model can be more effective to represent the profile of user.

With different independence assumptions, two variants of DRM were achieved, which were independent DRM (IDRM) and dependent DRM (DDRM). Finally, we presented the DRM based approach to question recommendation which can take full advantage of the particularities of users' different roles. Based on a unified probabilistic framework, our DRM based method naturally combines the user relation between the answerer and the asker with the content relevance between the answerer and the question.",1,ad,True

Additionally, an interesting result was that simply mixing the asker role into the answerer role not only failed to improve but impaired recommendation results of answerer role instead. Furthermore, we compared our DRM based recommendation methods with baseline methods based on a single role or blended roles. Experiment results on three data subsets showed our DRM significantly outperforms all baselines, where the relative improvement of DRM over the best baseline result is 7.2% for User-10, 6% for User-15, and 3.4% for User-20. In addition, DDRM is more effective than IDRM across data subsets, suggesting it is more effective to model users' dual roles. Finally, the parameter sensitivity analysis showed our DRM approach is robust.",1,Yahoo,True

One of the most interesting directions is to further study how the roles of users will vary over time, and whether that will have influence on question recommendation. The other interesting direction is how to diversify the recommendation results to satisfy users better.",0,,False

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"User votes are important signals in community question-answering (CQA) systems. Many features of typical CQA systems, e.g. the best answer to a question, status of a user, are dependent on ratings or votes cast by the community. In a popular CQA site, Yahoo! Answers, users vote for the best answers to their questions and can also thumb up or down each individual answer. Prior work has shown that these votes provide useful predictors for content quality and user expertise, where each vote is usually assumed to carry the same weight as others. In this paper, we analyze a set of possible factors that indicate bias in user voting behavior ­ these factors encompass different gaming behavior, as well as other eccentricities, e.g., votes to show appreciation of answerers. These observations suggest that votes need to be calibrated before being used to identify good answers or experts. To address this problem, we propose a general machine learning framework to calibrate such votes. Through extensive experiments based on an editorially judged CQA dataset, we show that our supervised learning method of content-agnostic vote calibration can significantly improve the performance of answer ranking and expert ranking.",1,Yahoo,True

"provide an environment for people to share knowledge and experience, which complement search engines by allowing questions to be posed in natural language and be answered by human beings through active content (i.e., answers) creation, instead of mining existing Web pages. Since the basis of CQA systems is the wide participation, the hurdle for users to proffer answers is typically minimal. Hence, CQA systems are also prone to spam and other kinds of abuse. Commercial spam itself is a widespread problem, and one that can mostly be tackled by conventional machine learning. Other forms of abuse, e.g., low quality content, willfully wrong answers are difficult for machines to detect, and again crowdsourcing quality content identification is an engaging, scalable way of ensuring that high quality questions and answers are identified and the creators appropriately rewarded. Different CQA systems have thus implemented different kinds of voting mechanisms coupled with user reputation systems in order to surface high quality content and discourage undesired behavior.",1,ad,True
"In this paper, we focus on votes in CQA sites. Take Yahoo! Answers for example, which is heavily dependent on the best answer voting scheme. An asker (user who asks a question) can vote for the best answer to his/her question. If the asker does vote, the best answer is declared and the question is labeled as resolved. If the asker does not vote for the best answer within certain period of time, other users in the community can vote for the best answer to that question. The answer that receives the largest number of best-answer votes within a certain period of time is then declared as the best answer to this question, and the question is declared resolved. Other than best-answer votes, users can also demonstrate their quality or opinion preferences by casting thumb-up or thumbdown votes on each individual answer.",1,Yahoo,True
"Although such voting mechanisms are designed with the intuition that they should be able to identify high quality answers and the corresponding answerers, there has been little study on the actual effectiveness of these systems in achieving this goal. On the other hand, many studies [1, 6, 15, 3, 8, 17, 10] have treated the user-voted best answers as the ground truth source of high quality answers and have developed models to predict whether an answer would be voted as the best answer based on features extracted from the answer, past activities of the answerer, etc. As a counter-point, other studies, e.g., [14, 9], report best answers not to be entirely high quality ones. In fact, as part of this work, we also observe that user-voted best answers do not always have high quality, possibly because of bias in users' voting behavior. A few examples of potential bias are:",0,,False
· Users may vote more positively for their friends' answers.,0,,False
781,0,,False
Even users who have interacted with each other in the CQA before might have a positive or negative bias depending on their past experience.,0,,False
· Users may use votes to show their appreciation to answerers instead of trying to identify high quality content.,1,ad,True
· Users who are trying to game the system in order to obtain high status can create multiple accounts and vote for one another.,0,,False
"· For questions about opinions, users tend to vote for the answers that share same opinions as theirs, but not necessarily of high quality.",0,,False
"Thus, instead of treating users' best-answer votes as the ground truth for answer quality, we ask trained human editors to judge answers based on a set of well-defined guidelines. Our first observation is that raw user votes have low correlation with editorial judgment. Based on this finding, we ask ""is it possible to calibrate the votes to mitigate the effects of potential bias, in order to increase the correlation between votes and editorially judged answer quality?""",1,ad,True
Contributions: We make the following contributions.,0,,False
"· We propose the novel problem of vote calibration in CQA systems. The basic idea is to associate every vote with a weight. Intuitively, votes from reputable voters who consistently vote for high quality answers should carry more weight, while votes susceptible to bias should carry less weight.",0,,False
"· In Section 5, based on exploratory data analysis we identify a variety of potential factors that possibly bias the votes.",0,,False
"· We develop a novel model for vote calibration based on supervised learning in Section 4. Intuitively, with each vote k we associate a feature vector xk which includes features capturing potential bias. Then, the importance weight of vote k is a function of the weighted sum of feature values, i.e., f (xk), where  is a vector of regression coefficients, xk is the inner product of xk and , and f (·) is a monotone function. Based on a set of editorially labeled answers,  is determined by minimizing the error of using calibrated votes f (xv) to predict the editorial labels.",0,,False
"· In Section 7, we experimentally show that the proposed vote calibration model outperforms a number of alternative methods for the answer ranking problem and the expert ranking problem. In particular, our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art SVM model [12] for expert ranking.",0,,False
"We note that since our focus is on vote calibration, we take a contentagnostic approach (i.e., no use of features extracted from answer content) similar to [12]. This makes our model applicable to votes on other types of content. Also, although we use Yahoo! Answers as the example CQA system throughout the paper, our model can be easily applied to other CQA systems. In fact we believe that our approach has the following useful properties ­ (i) it is robust to vote gaming, having incorporated a variety of such gaming behavioral features, and (ii) it provides a general framework for calibrating user votes in general crowdsourced rating platforms.",1,Yahoo,True
2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
"Although there have been many studies on CQA, to our knowledge, the problem of how to calibrate user votes to improve the correlation between votes and answer quality has not been systematically studied before. The related work can broadly be categorized into three threads.",1,ad,True
"Predicting user-voted best answers: There is a large body of work on building models to predict user-voted best answers (e.g., [1, 6, 15, 3, 8, 17, 10]). The assumption behind this line of work is that quality judgments of answers are expensive to obtain and it seems to be reasonable to use the readily available user-voted best answers as the target to predict. Different from this line of work, we do not try to predict user-voted best answers, but show that user-voted best answers may not be high quality ones because of potential bias in users' voting behavior. Our focus is on how to calibrate votes to minimize the discrepancy between votes and quality.",1,ad,True
"Predicting editorial judgments: Along with [2, 7, 16, 9, 14, 12], we define answer quality by a set of guidelines and obtain the ground-truth quality scores through an editorial process. For example, Agichtein et al. [2] used features extracted from text, user interaction graphs and votes to predict editorial judgments. Suryanto et al. [16] developed a number of graph-based methods to estimate user expertise, and evaluated these methods using editorially judged quality and relevance. Sakai et al. [9, 14] noticed bias in users' voting behavior that can cause user-voted best answers to be unsuitable for model evaluation, and proposed a number of evaluation methods based on editorial judgments. Similar to these studies, we also want to predict editorially labeled quality scores. Although user votes have commonly been used as features, calibration of each individual vote has not be studied.",0,,False
"Content-agnostic user expertise estimation: User expertise score estimation is an important use case of vote calibration. In the Section 7, we will show that using a simple average of the calibrated votes of a user as his/her expertise score can outperform the best methods reported in Liu et al. [12], where a variety of methods, such as PageRank-based method, HITS-based methods, competition-based methods, are empirically compared based on editorial judgments. Earlier work on user expertise is described in the following. Zhang et al. [18] proposed a PageRank-style algorithm for online forums. Jurczyk et al. [11] leveraged the HITS algorithm. Pal et al. [13] exploited the observation that experts usually answer questions that have not yet received good answers. Bouguessa et al.

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Category hierarchies often evolve at a much slower pace than the documents reside in. With newly available documents kept adding into a hierarchy, new topics emerge and documents within the same category become less topically cohesive. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic approach to modifying a given category hierarchy by redistributing its documents into more topically cohesive categories. The modification is achieved with three operations (namely, sprout, merge, and assign) with reference to an auxiliary hierarchy for additional semantic information; the auxiliary hierarchy covers a similar set of topics as the hierarchy to be modified. Our user study shows that the modified category hierarchy is semantically meaningful. As an extrinsic evaluation, we conduct experiments on document classification using real data from Yahoo! Answers and AnswerBag hierarchies, and compare the classification accuracies obtained on the original and the modified hierarchies. Our experiments show that the proposed method achieves much larger classification accuracy improvement compared with several baseline methods for hierarchy modification.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"With the exponential growth of textual information accessible, category hierarchy becomes one of the most widely-adopted and effective solutions in organizing large volume of documents. Hierarchy provides an organization of data by different levels of abstraction, in which each node (or category) represents a topic that is shared by the data in it. The connection between two nodes denotes supertype-subtype relation. Examples include Web directories provided by Yahoo! and Open Directory Project (ODP), hierarchies for community-based question-answering services by Yahoo! Answers (YA) and AnswerBag (AB), product hierarchies by online retailers like Amazon and eBay, as well as the hierarchies for news",1,ad,True

"Hierarchy enables not only easy document browsing, but also searching of the documents within user defined categories or subtrees of categories. Additionally, hierarchy information can be utilized to enhance retrieval models to improve the search accuracy [4]. On the other hand, users' information needs can only be satisfied with the documents accessible through the hierarchy (but not the category hierarchy itself). That is, the usefulness of a hierarchy heavily relies on the effectiveness of the hierarchy in properly organizing the existing data, and more importantly accommodating the newly available data into the hierarchy. Given the fast growth of text data, continuously accommodating large volume of newly available text data into a hierarchy is nontrivial. Automatic text classification techniques are often employed for efficient categorization of newly available documents into category hierarchies. However, hierarchy often evolves at a much slower pace than its documents. Two major problems often arise after adding many documents into a hierarchy after some time.",1,ad,True
"· Structure Irrelevance. A category hierarchy may well reflect the topical distribution of its data at the time of construction. However, as new topics always emerge from the newly coming documents, there is no proper category in the hierarchy to accommodate these new documents, leading to putting these documents in less relevant categories. As the result, some categories contain less topically cohesive documents. Moreover, some categories become less discriminative with respect to the current data distribution. One example is the two categories Printers and Scanners in YA, for there emerged many questions about multi-functional devices which are related to both printers and scanners, leading to ambiguity between these two categories.",1,ad,True
"· Semantics Irrelevance. Semantics may change over time which calls for a better organization of the documents [17]. For instance, when creating the hierarchy, experts are more likely to put category Petroleum under Geography. However, after the disaster of BP Gulf Oil Spill, a lot of news articles in category Petroleum are about the responsibility of the Obama Administration. These documents have stronger connection to category Politics than Geography. It is therefore more reasonable to put these documents under Politics for better document organization.",0,,False
"These two problems not only hurt user experiences in accessing information through the hierarchy, but also result in poorer classification accuracy for the classifiers categorizing newly available documents because of the less topically cohesive categories [15].",0,,False

"Consequently, the poorer classification accuracy further hurts user experience in browsing and searching documents through the hierarchy. This calls for category hierarchy maintenance, a task to modify the hierarchy to make it better reflect the topics of its documents, which in turn would improve the classification accuracy. Although a category hierarchy is relatively stable, many websites have modified or adjusted their hierarchies in the past. In May 2007, Yahoo! Answers added a new category Environment into her hierarchy, and added several categories like Facebook and Google under Internet later. By comparison, eBay adjusted her hierarchy more frequently, because there always emerge new types of items, like tablets and eReaders.",1,ad,True
"Hierarchy modification is nontrivial. Manual modification of category hierarchy is a tedious and difficult task, because it is hard to detect the semantic changes as well as the newly emerged topics. This motivates the data-driven automatic modification of a given hierarchy to cope with semantic changes and newly emerged topics. This is a challenging task because of at least two reasons, among others. First, the resultant modified category hierarchy (hereafter called modified hierarchy for short) should largely retain the semantics of the existing hierarchy and keep its category labels semantically meaningful. Second, the categories in the modified hierarchy shall demonstrate much higher topical cohesiveness, which in turn enables better classification accuracy in putting new documents into the modified hierarchy.",0,,False
"To the best of our knowledge, very few work has addressed the hierarchy modification problem (see Section 2). Tang et al. propose a novel approach to modifying the relations between categories aiming to improve the classification accuracy [17]. However, their proposed method does not change the leaf categories of the given hierarchy, and thus cannot solve the aforementioned problems. For example, the method may move the leaf category Petroleum to be child category of Politics. However, it is more reasonable to partition the documents in Petroleum into two categories: one being the child category of Geography, and the other child category of Politics. The method [17] fails to do so since it is unable to detect the newly emerged hidden topic ""Petroleum politics"".",1,ad,True
"In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to modify a given hierarchy (also called as the original hierarchy) with reference to an auxiliary hierarchy using three operations (namely, sprout, merge, and assign). An auxiliary hierarchy is a category hierarchy that covers a similar set of topics as does the given hierarchy (e.g., the Yahoo! hierarchy and ODP can be used as auxiliary hierarchy to each other). Similar to the concept of bisociation [8], our approach discovers finer and more elaborate categories (also known as hidden topics) by projecting the documents in the given hierarchy to the auxiliary hierarchy. This operation, similar to a cross-product operation between the categories from the given hierarchy and the categories from the auxiliary hierarchy, is named sprout 1. The similar hidden topics are then merged to form new",1,Yahoo,True

"categories in the modified hierarchy. The assign operation rebuilds the parent-child relations in the modified hierarchy. The category labels in the modified hierarchy are either borrowed from or generated based on both the original and the auxiliary hierarchies. We emphasize that the reuse of category labels from original and auxiliary hierarchies largely ensures semantically meaningful category labels in the modified hierarchy. When such an auxiliary hierarchy is unavailable, the given hierarchy can be used as an auxiliary hierarchy. Because of the three operations (i.e., sprout, merged, and assign), we name our approach the SMA approach. The main contributions are summarized as follows.",0,,False
"1) We propose a novel data-driven approach SMA to automatically modify a category hierarchy making it better reflect the topics of its documents. The proposed approach exploits the semantics of the given hierarchy and an auxiliary hierarchy, to guide the modification of the given hierarchy.",0,,False
"2) We evaluate the proposed approach using data from three realworld hierarchies, Yahoo! Answers, Answerbag, and ODP. The user study shows that the modified hierarchy fits with the data better than the original one does. As we argue that the categories in the modified hierarchy are more topically cohesive compared to the original hierarchy, we employ text classification as an extrinsic evaluation. Our experimental results show that the classifiers trained on the modified hierarchy achieve much higher classification accuracy (measured by both macro-F1 and micro-F1), than the classifier built on the original hierarchy, or the classifiers modeled on the hierarchies generated by three baseline methods, including the state-of-the-art method in [17] and the hierarchy generation method in [2].",1,Yahoo,True
"The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 surveys the related work. We describe the research problem and overview the proposed approach in Section 3. The three operations are detailed in Section 4. The experimental evaluation and discussion of the results are presented in Section 5. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 6.",0,,False

"Hierarchy Generation. Hierarchy generation focuses on extracting a hierarchical structure from a set of categories, each containing a set of documents. The generation process can be either fully automatic [2, 5, 11] or semi-automatic [1, 7, 22]. The semi-automatic approaches involve interaction with domain experts in the hierarchy generation process. In the following, we review the fully automatic approaches in more detail.",0,,False
Aggarwal et al. use the category labels of documents to supervise hierarchy generation [2]. They first calculate the centroids of all categories and use them as the initial seeds. Similar categories are merged and clusters with few documents are discarded. The process is iterated to build the hierarchy. User study is employed to evaluate the quality of the generated hierarchy.,0,,False
"Punera et al. utilizes a divisive hierarchical clustering approach, which first splits the given set of categories into two sets of categories, and each such set is partitioned recursively until it contains only one category [11].",0,,False
"An algorithm for generating hierarchy for short text is proposed by Chuang et al. [5]. They first create a binary-tree hierarchy by hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and then construct a multiway-tree hierarchy from the binary-tree hierarchy. They use both classification measurement and user evaluation to evaluate the generated hierarchy.",0,,False

to each hierarchy to generate new ones. The newly generated hierarchies are evaluated and the hierarchies with poor classification accuracy are removed. The process is repeated until the classification accuracy is not improved.,0,,False
"Different from hierarchy generation which assumes a set of categories as input, our hierarchy modification method takes a hierarchy as the input. Hierarchy generation does not change the given categories hence it cannot solve the structure irrelevance problem.",0,,False
"Hierarchy Modification. Tang et al. present a method of modifying a hierarchy to improve the classification accuracy [17]. The method introduces three operations. The promote operation lifts a category to upper level; the merge operation generates a new parent for a category and its most similar sibling; the demote operation either demotes a category as a child of its most similar sibling, or makes the sibling a child of the category. For each category in the given hierarchy, promote operation is tested, followed by merge and demote operations, in a top-down manner. The operation comes into effect if it can improve the classification accuracy. The approach iterates the process until no improvement can be observed or some criterion is met. In experiments, this method outperforms clustering-based hierarchy generation method in terms of classification accuracy. However, this method does not change the leaf categories, leaving the topically incohesive leaf categories untouched. In addition, the method [17] has a high time-complexity. Due to the high time complexity of the method [17], Kiyoshi et al. propose an approach [10] to addressing the efficiency issue.",1,ad,True
"Discussion. With the existing work on either hierarchy generation or hierarchy modification, the leaf categories in the modified hierarchy (i.e., either generated or modified) remain unchanged. Clearly, without changing leaf categories, the topical incohesiveness among documents in the same leaf category remains unaddressed. Consequently, the likely poorer classification accuracy for these topically incohesive categories results in poorer document organization in the hierarchy. In this paper, we therefore propose an automatic approach to modify a given hierarchy where the leaf categories could be split or merged so as to better reflect the topics of the documents in the hierarchy.",1,ad,True
3. SMA APPROACH OVERVIEW,1,AP,True
"We observe that each category in a hierarchy may contain several ""hidden topics"", each of which is topically cohesive, e.g., category Computer contains hidden topics like Internet Programming, Operating Systems, etc. With more documents adding to a category hierarchy, new ""hidden topics"" emerge within a single category leading to topical incohesiveness among its documents (see Section 1). Our proposed approach, therefore, aims to find the hidden topics within each category and then sprout categories based on its hidden topics, merge similar hidden topics to form new categories, and then assign the parent-child relation among categories. We name our approach SMA after its three major operations.",1,ad,True
"The key challenges in the approach include: (i) How to detect the ""hidden topics"" at the appropriate granularity? (ii) How to evaluate the similarity between ""hidden topics""? and (iii) How to assign the parent-child relation between the unmodified and modified categories? Further, recall from Section 1, the modified hierarchy has to largely retain the semantics of the existing hierarchy, with meaningful category labels and topically cohesive categories. In the following, we give a high-level overview of the SMA approach and then detail the three major operations in the next Section.",0,,False

For example, Yahoo! hierarchy and ODP hierarchy can be auxiliary hierarchy to each other. Similarly, Yahoo! Answers and AnswerBag can be auxiliary hierarchy to each other.",1,Yahoo,True
"The auxiliary hierarchy Ha plays an essential role in finding hidden topics. Note that the hidden topics are not readily present in the auxiliary hierarchy, and our approach does not simply use the structure of auxiliary hierarchy as part of the modified hierarchy. Instead, they contain semantics from both the original hierarchy and the auxiliary hierarchy. We use the following example to illustrate. Suppose that the original hierarchy has two categories, Action movie and Comedy movie, and the auxiliary hierarchy contains two categories America and Asia. Our approach will find that Action movie has two hidden topics, namely American action movie and Asian active movie; Comedy movie also has two hidden topics, namely American comedy movie and Asian comedy movie.",1,ad,True
"The auxiliary hierarchy also plays an important role in guiding the merge operation, which is to merge similar hidden topics to generate the categories of the modified hierarchy. Continue with the earlier example, after merging the generated hidden topics, we may get new categories­American movie and Asian movie (if ""action vs. comedy"" is evaluated to be less discriminative compared with ""American vs. Asian""). The semantics of the hierarchy to be modified, together with the semantics of the auxiliary hierarchy, will be exploited to define the similarity between hidden topics.",0,,False

A set of categories from Ha each of which contains a reasonable number of documents originally from Ci is identified to represent Ci's hidden topics (line 5). The two parameters, minimum coverage ratio  and maximum loss ratio  , adjust the number of hidden topics. New finer categories are then sprouted from Ci according to the hidden topics and the documents in category Ci are assigned to these finer categories (or hidden topics) (line 6). Given the expected number of categories n on level (line 7), the merge operation forms n number of new categories on level of the intermediate hierarchy Hn (line 8). If the current level is not the lowest level in the hierarchy, the parentchild relations between the modified categories and the unmodified categories on the next level are assigned (line 9). The last step in the SMA algorithm is to generate category labels with reference to both the original and auxiliary hierarchies (line 10).",1,ad,True

We proceed to give an overview of the proposed method. Given a category Ci in the intermediate hierarchy Hn during the modification process (see Algorithm 1), we assign all its documents into the categories of the auxiliary hierarchy Ha, and get a set of candidate categories from Ha in a tree-structure. Each candidate category contains a number of documents from Ci. Then, with the consideration of both cohesion and separation, we select a set of categories from the tree as hidden topics. The selection process is modeled as an optimization problem. We now elaborate the details.",0,,False
"Document Projection. To assign documents from Ci to Ha, we represent a document by its word feature vector, and a category in Ha by its centroid vector. Based on cosine similarity between the document and the centroids, we recursively assign each document d  Ci to Ha from its root to a leaf category along a single path of categories. If a good number of documents from Ci are assigned to a category Ca in Ha, then the topic of Ca is relevant to Ci, and the semantics of Ca can be used to describe a hidden topic of Ci. Thus, multiple categories in Ca can be identified to describe all hidden topics of Ci. For example, large number of documents from category Programming assigned into two categories Security and Network in an auxiliary hierarchy, implies that Programming has two hidden topics: Network Programming and Security Programming. We have also tried to build a classifier on Ha to assign documents from Ci to Ha using Naive Bayes and support vector machine, respectively, and the set of generated hidden topics is almost the same.",0,,False

"After the test data selected, the remaining data is used for hierarchy modification. We split the remaining data of HYA into 3 parts: P1, P2, P3, and the proportion of their sizes is 12:3:1. Using P1 for HYA and a given auxiliary hierarchy, we obtain a modified hierarchy HnYA. Naturally, all documents in P1 have category labels from hierarchy HnYA. We then build a classifier using all documents in P1 and their labels from HnYA. The classifier classifies documents in P2 and P3. Assume that the classifier gives reasonably good classification accuracy, then all documents in P2 and P3 have their category labels assigned according to HnYA. With these labels, we can evaluate the classification accuracy of documents in P3 by the classifier built using P2 on HnYA. Intuitively, if a hierarchy H1 better organizes documents than another hierarchy H2, then the classifier trained on H1 is expected to have higher classification accuracy for P3 than a classifier built on H2. We then select the parameters leading to the best classification accuracy for P3. In our experiments, the parameters (i.e.,  and  ) set for SMAYA|YA, SMAYA|AB, and SMAYA|ODP are (0.29 and 0.11), (0.17 and 0.17), (0.38 and 0.08), respectively.",1,ad,True

Because BUC and HA do not change the leaf categories, the original labels of the 500 questions remain applicable. For SC and SMA, both changing leaf categories, we invited two annotators to label the 500 questions to their most relevant leaf categories in the modified hierarchies.

NB achieves better accuracy than SVM probably because NB was used as the base classifier for parameter setting. The three baseline modification methods only slightly improve the classification accuracy over the original hierarchy and even deteriorate the accuracy in some cases. Recall that SC and SMA modify leaf categories while BUC and HA only modify internal structures of hierarchy without changing leaf categories. All the methods that change leaf categories outperform the methods that keep leaf categories unchanged. Note that SMAYA|YA significantly outperforms SC.

Note that the HAB has 265 categories which is more than twice of the 115 categories contained in HYA. The parameters  and  were set as 0.17 and 0.08, respectively, using the parameter setting approach described earlier. The classification accuracy is reported in Table 3. Observe that SMAAB|YA improves the classification accuracy (Macro- and Micro-F1) by 30% to 63%, compared with the result obtained before hierarchy modification.

We asked three students to annotate which category path better reflects the topic of the question. Which hierarchy a category path was originated from was not provided to the annotators. Given a question, each volunteer is asked to rate each path from 1(lowest) to 5(highest) based on its quality. hen, we select one of the following choices based on the averaged ratings (rYA and rnYA for the two paths, respectively).

The third category is formed based on the overlapping part of the original two categories, which contains questions about instant messaging (IM) and blog software. This demonstrates that the proposed approach can discover and detach the overlapping hidden topics. 2) Two pairs of categories of the original hierarchy, (Laptops & Notebooks and Desktops), and (Printers and Scanners), are merged into two categories in the modified hierarchy, because of the high similarity between the categories within each pair. This shows that categories with high overlap in semantics are merged. 3) For Hardware, some hidden topics are discovered and new categories are formed, like Storage and CPU & Memory & Motherboard, whose questions come from Desktops, Add-ons and Other - Hardwares in the original hierarchy. These newly formed categories are more isolated from each other.",1,blog,True
6. CONCLUSION,0,,False
"Category hierarchy plays a very important role in organizing data automatically (through classifiers built on the hierarchy) or manually. However, with newly available documents added into a hierarchy, new topics emerge and documents within the same category become less topically cohesive. Thus the hierarchies suffer from problems of structure irrelevance and semantic irrelevance, leading to poor classification accuracy of the classifiers developed for automatically categorizing the newly available documents into the hierarchy, which in turn leads to poorer document organization. To address these problems, we propose a novel approach SMA to modify a hierarchy. SMA comprises three non-trivial operations (namely, sprout, merge, and assign) to modify a hierarchy. Experimental results demonstrate that SMA is able to generate a modified",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"While Web search has become increasingly effective over the last decade, for many users' needs the required answers may be spread across many documents, or may not exist on the Web at all. Yet, many of these needs could be addressed by asking people via popular Community Question Answering (CQA) services, such as Baidu Knows, Quora, or Yahoo! Answers. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale analysis of how searchers become askers. For this, we study the logs of a major web search engine to trace the transformation of a large number of failed searches into questions posted on a popular CQA site. Specifically, we analyze the characteristics of the queries, and of the patterns of search behavior that precede posting a question; the relationship between the content of the attempted queries and of the posted questions; and the subsequent actions the user performs on the CQA site. Our work develops novel insights into searcher intent and behavior that lead to asking questions to the community, providing a foundation for more effective integration of automated web search and social information seeking.",1,ad,True

"While Web search engines have significantly progressed in effectiveness and efficiency over the last decade, there still exist certain user needs that cannot be satisfied. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as the difficulty of expressing a complex need as a short search query, the lack of existing relevant content on the Web (e.g., for unique or ""tail"" needs that keep appearing), and for more ""social"" needs, for which the user prefers to interact with a real human.",1,ad,True

"In fact, Hitwise in August 2011 reported that only 6680% of the searches are successful1, and Hassan et al. [15] obtained a similar success rate of search goals (73%) via human labeling. We argue that many such unsatisfied searches could be addressed by asking people via Community Question Answering (CQA) services, such as Baidu Knows, Quora, or Yahoo! Answers. It already happens in practice. For example, we have observed that about 2% of web search sessions performed by users who are also members of the Yahoo! Answers community, lead to a question posted to the community. Consider Figure 1a, which depicts a sample search submitted to a major search engine. The searcher is not satisfied with the results, and eventually posts a related question on the Yahoo! Answers site, which is then answered to the searcher's satisfaction. Understanding and improving the synergy between searching and community question answering is at the heart of this work.",1,ad,True
"Specifically, our goal is to better understand the behavior of these users, as well as characterize the types of Web searches that could be effectively handled by CQA sites. Insights acquired during such analysis should bring multiple benefits to both search engines and CQA systems. On one hand, search engines always need to better understand when searchers are unsatisfied by the returned results. More specifically, Web search engines would find value in analyzing the search session patterns of such unsuccessful queries, the associated underlying query intents, and possibly reflect these findings in search effectiveness metrics. One can even imagine new search experiences that would allow users to turn to the community for certain types of needs better addressed by people than by traditional Web search. Additionally, CQA systems could potentially improve the asking experience by taking advantage of the context provided by unsuccessful queries preceding a posted question. One can imagine several ways to leverage this context, such as automatically giving examples of irrelevant answers to clarify the question to the community.",1,ad,True
"To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to perform a large-scale study of the transformation of searchers into askers.

"Once we had search sessions and question sessions, and mapping between some of them, we created two datasets. The first, termed SearchAsk dataset, contains search sessions that turned into question sessions. We only kept such sessions that resulted in posting one and only one question for simplicity of analysis later on. In addition, we only kept sessions in which the posted question is ""relevant"" to a previously issued query (if the query and the question share at least one non-stopword, they were considered relevant). By observing that some users actually searched for Yahoo! Answers to navigate to its home page before they posted a question there, we deleted such special navigational clicks and corresponding queries from the user action sequences. The second dataset, termed SearchOnly dataset, consists of search sessions that did not turn into question sessions. In both datasets, we only kept sessions for users that posted at least once in Yahoo! Answers, since these users are aware of the site and know how to post a question there, thus removing the potential investment of effort for newcomers to join the site, and filtering our the users that simply do not know where to ask questions.",1,ad,True
"Table 1 reports the statistics of the datasets we obtained. As shown in the table, 95.8% of all the search sessions are SearchOnly sessions, while SearchAsk sessions account for 1.65%. Despite the sparsity of the SearchAsk sessions, we still believe that understanding how searchers become askers in such sessions can be helpful for improving the search experience of these users and perhaps more users. Indeed, the two datasets allow us to investigate the differences between sessions in which users posted a question following attempted searches, mainly due to search failure or searcher frustration, and sessions in which users that have experience of asking questions on Yahoo! Answers did not bother or did not need to ask questions at that time. Recall, that the users in these datasets satisfy two conditions: (1) having clicked at least a Yahoo!

In contrast, SearchAsk quries are more likely to start with question words (e.g., `how', `what'), and tend to use more verbose natural language to express the needs of the searchers (e.g., `want', `to', `know') rather than using only keywords.",1,YouTube,True

"To verify the hypothesis from the above word distribution analysis that SearchAsk queries are more likely to be unique, we compute the frequency4 of SearchAsk queries and SearchOnly queries in our 1-month query log. Figure 3 shows the results. We can see that over 90% of SearchAsk queries are tail (actually unique) queries, indicating the variety of the needs of searchers and the ways to express them.

"To better understand user needs behind SearchAsk queries, we further examine the results returned in their search engine result pages (SERPs).

Answers question page occurs in the SERPs for half of the queries that eventually turn to questions, but for only 13% of SearchOnly queries. It is clear that SearchAsk queries are more likely to have a Yahoo! Answers question page in the SERP. This is not surprising. First, having a Yahoo! Answers question page in search results indicates that the query could be relevant to an existing Yahoo! Answers question. Therefore, answers from a human might be more suitable to address the need behind the query, encouraging the searcher to post a question on Yahoo! Answers.

Answers question result in 47.8% of the sessions, a click on other result in 31.2% of the sessions, and a query in 17.4% of the sessions. We notice that in about half of the sessions, the searcher posts a question right after clicking on a Yahoo! Answers question page from the search engine results. There may be several reasons for this. First, such a click indicates that the query is relevant to the clicked question, and therefore it probably carries an information need that would benefit from a human response. Second, when the clicked Yahoo! Answers question page cannot satisfy the search need, it encourages the user to post a new question on Yahoo! Answers. Of course, it is also possible that a searcher had already decided to post a question when seeing the original SERP, and she then clicked on a Yahoo!

SearchAsk transition probabilities are shown in red before the slash symbol, while SearchOnly transition probabilities are shown in black after the slash symbol. If we look at the transitions for SearchOnly sessions from the figure, we can see that after issuing a query, the searcher is very likely to click on other result, then with perhaps more queries and clicks on other result, and then ends the session. Clicking on a Yahoo! Answers question result is very unlikely. However, in SearchAsk sessions, the searcher has a higher probability on clicking a Yahoo! Answers question result. After the click, the searcher in SearchAsk sessions would post a question on Yahoo! Answers for around half of the time.""",1,Yahoo,True

In contrast, the top frequent path in SearchAsk sessions indicates more ""social"" needs of the searchers, i.e., they issue a query, click on a search result of Yahoo!

Queries, on the other hand, tend to focus more on the things or actions that are searched for, with content words like `best', `free', `download' and `games' as well as question words like `how', `why' and `what' occurring more frequently than in the associated questions corpus.

This is somewhat surprising, since we would expect more complete inclusion of the query terms in the question. However, it seems that with the freedom of writing a free text question, searchers tend to rephrase some of the terms they used in their queries. For example, abbreviations and short terms are turned into their more complete forms, e.g. `AZ' into `Arizona' and `newborn' into `new baby' (see example 7 and 8 in Table 7). In addition, while 31% of the pairs do show complete inclusion of the query terms in the question, many times the query terms do not all appear in the question's subject or content, but spread in both question parts.

"To measure this topical difference between the two types of questions, we looked at the distribution of categories to which the questions in the two compared corpora are assigned. Table 8 shows the categories with largest differences in assignment probability, those that are preferred more in the general question corpus and in the search-related question corpus respectively. These lists show that searchers tend to ask informational questions [14] to get fact- or adviceoriented answers, such as how to fix the car or maintain one's garden, how to bake cookies, but also questions related to Yahoo products, such as Yahoo! Mail. On the other hand, regular askers are more likely to ask conversational questions [14] with a social flavor, such as discussions around music or sports events, politics and religions, and opinions on possible baby names. We manually labeled 100 questions randomly sampled from the search-related question corpus, and found none are conversational, showing a very different distribution compared to that 38% of Yahoo! Answers questions are conversational as reported in [14]. We conjecture that this is because searchers usually turn to search engines to find information instead of starting conversations. Another kind of questions that are less likely searched first over the web are personal questions, in which the asker is interested in adding very personal details. These include topics such as diet and fitness advices, dating and style opinions. Finally, there are questions that are too complex, for which the asker knows the answer cannot be found on the web. A good example are Math questions, such as example 4 in Table 7.",1,corpora,True

Yet, interestingly, this attribute is due to more sentences that are written on average per general question, while if we look at the number of words per sentence, we see that surprisingly search-related questions have slightly more words in each sentence.

As can be seen by Figure 9, in terms of number of actions, the difference of about one more action on average for regular askers is small though constant. For the duration of the interaction, regular askers spend about 7% more time on average around the question, but looking at the median, the difference is substantially larger, with half the searchers spending 2.2 hours or less while the typical askers tend to spend about 68% more time, or 3.7 hours, at the median.

Liu et al. [18] argued that some of these needs can be satisfied with existing answers from CQA archives by harnessing the unique structure of such archives for detecting web searcher satisfaction.

There is also some previous work related to asker behavior analysis. For example, Adamic et al. [1] analyzed the content properties and user interaction patterns across different Yahoo!

It provides insights into some specific needs that searchers try to express on search engines, yet are not satisfied by search results, and turn to human answerers instead. We analyzed the various aspects of SearchAsk sessions, includ-",1,ad,True

"Our findings may contribute both to search-engine optimization, as well as to better user experience in CQA sites.

This finding may influence CQA sites to promote questions coming from searchers, if they want to retain their engagement. As another example, our analysis of the transitions between user actions in SearchAsk sessions, and especially the fact that question asking is typically preceded by viewing a CQA page, may help search engines. They might decide to detect such cases and explicitly promote the option of asking a question to the searcher, even before she resorts into doing it on her own. Furthermore, as this paper demonstrates, modeling the transformation of a query meant for an automated search engine into a fully specified question meant for human, provides a valuable tool for query intent and satisfaction analysis.",0,,False

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"We introduce the problem of domain adaptation for content-based retrieval and propose a domain adaptation method based on relative aggregation points (RAPs). Content-based retrieval including image retrieval and spoken document retrieval enables a user to input examples as a query, and retrieves relevant data based on the similarity to the examples. However, input examples and relevant data can be dissimilar, especially when domains from which the user selects examples and from which the system retrieves data are different. In content-based geographic object retrieval, for example, suppose that a user who lives in Beijing visits Kyoto, Japan, and wants to search for relatively inexpensive restaurants serving popular local dishes by means of a content-based retrieval system. Since such restaurants in Beijing and Kyoto are dissimilar due to the difference in the average cost and areas' popular dishes, it is difficult to find relevant restaurants in Kyoto based on examples selected in Beijing. We propose a solution for this problem by assuming that RAPs in different domains correspond, which may be dissimilar but play the same role. A RAP is defined as the expectation of instances in a domain that are classified into a certain class, e.g. the most expensive restaurant, average restaurant, and restaurant serving the most popular dishes. Our proposed method constructs a new feature space based on RAPs estimated in each domain and bridges the domain difference for improving content-based retrieval in heterogeneous domains. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we evaluated various methods with a test collection developed for content-based geographic object retrieval. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieved significant improvements over baseline methods. Moreover, we observed that the search performance of content-based retrieval in heterogeneous domains was significantly lower than that in homogeneous domains. This finding suggests that relevant data for the same search intent depend on the search context, that is, the location where the user searches and the domain from which the system retrieves data.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Content-based retrieval enables a user to input examples as a query, and retrieves relevant data based on the similarity to the examples. In multimedia retrieval, it is difficult to represent complex search intents by using keywords due to the difference in medium between input and output; thus, content-based retrieval has been successfully applied to a wide range of multimedia retrieval including image retrieval [17] and spoken document retrieval [9], as well as geographic object retrieval [15].",0,,False
"Content-based geographic object retrieval proposed by Kato et al. [15] provides a means by which a user can select geographic objects (e.g. restaurants) as a query in a domain s/he knows well (denoted by source domain D(S)) for retrieving objects from a domain s/he does not know well (denoted by target domain D(T )). This search method is helpful, especially when the searcher has little knowledge of the target domain, as it is usually difficult to make a concrete query without knowledge on the domain in which the user wants to search [2]. Suppose that a user who lives in Beijing visits Kyoto, Japan, and wants to search for restaurants, say, relatively inexpensive restaurants serving popular local dishes. If the user has little knowledge of Kyoto and no idea about the average cost and what the popular local dishes are there, it might be difficult for him/her to specify attributes (e.g. a category and price range of restaurants), or make a keyword query that represents his/her search intent. By using a content-based geographic object retrieval system, a user is able to make an example query without knowledge of the target domain by selecting familiar source domain examples that are relevant to his/her search intent.",0,,False
"A challenge in content-based geographic object retrieval is to find relevant instances from a target domain D(T ) based on examples selected from a heterogeneous source domain D(S). When the two domains are dissimilar, examples selected from D(S) are not always similar to relevant instances from D(T ). For example, assume that the user who visits Kyoto selects relatively inexpensive restaurants serving popular local dishes in Beijing. Such restaurants in Beijing and Kyoto are dissimilar since the average cost and popular local dishes are different in the two domains. Therefore, the content-based geographic object retrieval system has to find instances semantically similar to the given examples against superficial dissimilarity between instances from heterogeneous domains. Although similar problems have been recognized as domain",0,,False

"adaptation [20], domain adaptation for content-based retrieval has not been addressed in the literature. We discuss related work on domain adaptation in Section 2, and formalize and characterize domain adaptation for content-based retrieval in Section 3.",1,ad,True
"We propose a method for accurately predicting relevant instances in a domain based on selected examples in another heterogeneous domain. We assume that different domains include corresponding points that may not be the same in terms of their representation but play the same role in heterogeneous domains. For the Kyoto and Beijing example, both domains include the most expensive restaurant, the average restaurant, and a restaurant serving the most popular dishes there. These kinds of points are identified through aggregation based on relative and domain-independent operation; we call these points relative aggregation points (RAPs). We assume that RAPs in different domains correspond, and construct a new feature representation for each instance based on RAPs from the source and target domains. Several kinds of similarities are measured between RAPs and instances, each of which is used to represent instances in the new feature space. Incorporating features represented by RAPs bridges the gap between heterogeneous domains and enables us to capture the place of an instance in a domain.",1,AP,True
"Our experiment was designed to provide answers to two research questions on domain adaptation for content-based retrieval. The first research question is whether domain adaptation for contentbased retrieval is necessary. In other words, are relevant data different for the same search intent in different locations and datasets? We answered this research question based on a test collection developed for content-based geographic object retrieval, which includes relevant data for 100 queries (20 search intents in five domains). Our experimental result showed that mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) [12] in out-domain settings (D(S) , D(T )) were significantly lower than those in in-domain settings (D(S) ,"" D(T )). This finding suggests that relevant data can vary in different search locations and datasets and has important implication for relevance judgment in information retrieval tasks. The second research question is whether domain adaptation based on RAPs can bridge the domain difference and significantly improve the search performance of content-based retrieval in heterogeneous domains. In our experiment based on the aforementioned test collection, our proposed method showed significant improvements on MAP and nDCG over baseline methods.""",1,ad,True
"The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We describe related work on domain adaptation in Section 2, and formalize and characterize domain adaptation for content-based retrieval in Section 3. In Section 4, we propose a method for domain adaptation based on RAPs. In Section 5, we describe the test collection developed for content-based geographic object retrieval and show experimental results in Section 6. We conclude with a summary of our findings and future work in Section 7.",1,ad,True
2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
"Domain adaptation [20] has been addressed in several tasks such as part of speech tagging [5], text classification [4, 16, 27, 28], and learning to rank [7, 11, 26]. The motivation behind domain adaptation is that a model trained in a source domain D(S) does not work well in a heterogeneous target domain D(T ). The aforementioned content-based retrieval problem is also a domain adaptation problem since it is a process for modeling a search intent from examples selected in a domain, and inferring relevant instances in another by using the model. In this section, we describe related work on domain adaptation and clarify our contributions of this paper.",1,ad,True
"Blitzer et al. proposed structural correspondence learning (SCL) for domain adaptation [4, 5]. SCL first extracts pivot features, which behave in the same way in different domains. The correlation with the pivot features is then used to identify correspondences among features from different domains. Each instance is represented by the correspondence together with its own features. SCL has been successfully applied to part of speech tagging and sentiment classification, and is considered a state-of-the-art method for domain adaptation. Since our proposed method is similar to SCL in terms of incorporating corresponding points not corresponding features, we included SCL as a baseline and compared it with our proposed method.",1,ad,True
"Several domain adaptation methods for document classification tasks have been proposed recently. Dai et al. proposed a domain adaptation method based on co-clustering [10]. The method clusters words and documents simultaneously in a target domain, restricting word clusters by labels from a source domain and transferring the labels to documents in the target domain. Ling et al. incorporated spectral clustering for domain adaptation to construct a new feature space based on the clustering results [16]. Spectral clustering is applied to documents in a source and target domain under the source domain supervision, so that documents in the target domain are separated as much as possible. Their method then represents documents by their vector that encodes clusters to which a document belongs. Xue et al. proposed a method based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) for domain adaptation [28]. They assumed that different domains include common latent topics, applied pLSA to documents under the source domain supervision, and classified documents from a target domain using common topics obtained through the pLSA. Wang et al. tackled a problem of cross-language document classification [27]. They argued that cross-language document classification is a challenge because of cultural discrepancies and translation ambiguities. It is an interesting and similar motivation to our geographic object retrieval example in which the cultural discrepancy may prevent training an accurate model.",1,ad,True
"In addition to document classification tasks, some studies have focused on domain adaptation for learning to rank tasks. Cai et al. proposed active query selection for ranking adaptation, which seeks instances to be labeled in the target domain for an effective training [7]. Wang et al. tackled the problem of learning to rank, assuming that there is a common latent space in different domains, and mapped instances onto the space preserving the label order [26]. Gao et al. proposed a method based on re-weighting labeled instances for learning to rank in heterogeneous domains [11]. The main idea of their approach is that the label information of source domain instances similar to ones from a target domain is more helpful in predicting the label of target domain instances than dissimilar source domain instances. Although we also focus on an information retrieval task, our problem described in the following section uses pairs of an instance and binary label; thus, we cannot simply adapt their methods to our problem and compare them with our proposed method.",1,ad,True
"Nakajima and Tanaka proposed a relative query processing method [18]. A relative query consists of a set of instances and an instance in the set. Their relative query processing method represents an instance x in a set X as a vector from the centroid of X to x. The differences between domain adaptation for contentbased retrieval and the relative query processing method are the following two aspects: (i) a content-based retrieval system returns ranked instances, while the relative query aims to find only a relevant instance, and (ii) domain adaptation for content-based retrieval addresses a problem that the same features may have dif-",1,ad,True

"ferent meanings in different domains, while the relative query processing method does not and only addresses the relativity of the feature value. Moreover, we included their method as a baseline in our experiment and showed the difference in effectiveness between our proposed method and the relative query processing method.",1,ad,True
"We assume that different domains include points that play the same role, like the assumption of common features in most of the previous work. However, we would like to emphasize a fundamental difference; we do not assume that common features in different domains correlate with labels in the same way. The reason for this is that even the same features may indicate different meanings in different domains. For example, sushi restaurants in Beijing and Kyoto that are exactly the same may be relevant in Kyoto, but irrelevant in Beijing for a user who wants a restaurant serving local dishes. Moreover, a test collection we developed for the contentbased geographic object retrieval is different from commonly used test collections such as 20 Newsgroups1 in some aspects. Our test collection includes different types of features: continuous, such as the cost and distance from the nearest station, discrete, such as category information, and high-dimensional, such as the description of a restaurant. The label distribution is usually balanced in the sentiment and category classification tasks addressed in previous work, while the amount of relevant instances to a search intent is relatively small in our test collection and is different in different search intents and domains. The unbalanced label distribution might impair the performance of previously proposed methods, as revealed in our experiment.",1,ad,True

From instances X(S) sampled from the source domain D(S), the user can select a subset Q  X(S) that consists of instances relevant to his/her search intent. The example selection can be interpreted as a labeling process on the instances X(S), and label-instance pairs are denoted by D(S) "","" {(x(S), +1) | x(S)  Q}  {(x(S), -1) | x(S)  (X(S) - Q)}, where a label space Y (S) comprises -1 (nonselected examples) and +1 (selected examples). Therefore, a query in content-based retrieval is represented as the set of labelinstance pairs D(S). On another front, instances sampled from the target domain D(T ) are denoted by X(T ), and label-instance pairs are denoted by D(T ), in which a label represents binary relevance or graded relevance for a search intent; thus, a label space Y (T ) is a set of integer values. A content-based retrieval system ranks the instances X(T ) based on a ranking function f : X(T )  R trained by label-instance pairs D(S) and target instances X(T ), where a total order  on the instances X(T ) is given by x(iT )  x(jT )  f (x(iT ))  f (x(jT )).

"The most important difference from domain adaptation tasks addressed in previous work is that no label information in the target domain is available during the training process in content-based retrieval. Relevant instances in the target domain depend on the user's search intents; thus, it is not realistic to prepare labels for all possible search intents. Note that in many cases all the instances from the target domain are not available for training in ad-hoc information retrieval due to the amount of data. Instead of using all the data, one can sample some data from the target domain or re-rank top ranked instances using them as target instances. For contentbased geographic object retrieval, it is feasible to use all the target instances because the size of instances in a region the user focuses on is generally small (1,000 at most).",1,ad,True
"The difference between domains is characterized by the difference in feature spaces and marginal distributions. In content-based geographic object retrieval, for example, features spaces in different domains are the same, i.e. X (S) ,"" X (T ).

On the other hand, marginal distributions in different domains can be different, i.e. P (X(S)) "","" P (X(T )). For example, there are many expensive restaurants in Tokyo, many Japanese-style restaurants in Kyoto, and many restaurants serving spicy dishes in Beijing. Recent studies proposed methods for quantifying the domain difference by using A-distance for estimating the learning bound for domain adaptation [3, 21]. In our experiment, we demonstrated the domain difference measured by A-distance dA for ensuring that domains we used are different from each other.

Only nouns and adjectives were used to construct a text vector xt whose elements represent the term frequency in those text attributes. Feature selection was carried out excluding terms that occured less than three times in our test collection. The category attribute is a set of category values, e.g. {bar, sushi, Japanese-style}. We treated the category attribute the same as text attributes (i.e. bag-of-words), and represented a category vector as xc. Although category values are hierarchically structured in the GourNavi Web service (e.g. top categories include Japanese-style and Western-style, and sub categories under the Japanese-style category include sushi and tempura), we did not use the hierarchical structure for simplicity. The text and category attributes were separately processed and were weighted by the tf-idf method. To be more specific, the i-th element of the text vector xt for an instance x is tf(ti) log (N/df(ti)), where tf(ti) is the frequency of a term ti in the instance x, df(ti) is the number of instances that include the term ti, and N is the number of instances in our test collection. The category vector xc is weighted in the same manner.

We opted to use Yahoo! Chiebukuro as the resource of search intents because complex and realistic intents are posted there. A hundred of questions were extracted as search intents from Yahoo! Chiebukuro, and were classified into two types in terms of domain-dependency for characterizing each search intent. Domain dependency is the degree of variability of a search intent in different domain, and was subjectively evaluated by two assessors we hired only for this task. We asked them to score the extracted search intent on a scale from one (independent from the domain) to five (dependent on the domain). As their agreement on 100 questions was low: 0.233 in terms of quadratic weighted kappa [24], we separated the labels into domain-dependent (a score is three or more) and domain-independent (a score is less than three), and excluded all the questions on which the two assessors disagreed. As a result, 57 questions remained, of which 20 (35.1%) questions were domain-dependent and 37 (64.9%) questions were domain-independent.

First, subjects who finished a task within five minutes were filtered out, as it was supposed to take more than five minutes in a preliminary system test. Second, we manually assessed all the relevant instances for each search intent in each domain, and removed subjects who made obviously wrong relevance judgments. For example, we removed a subject who selected a restaurant for 1,000 JPY as relevant when the subject was asked to find restaurants for 5,000 JPY. After the removal of low-quality subjects, there remained 579 subjects and 6,082 relevance judgments.

"To assess the completeness of our relevance judgments, we used a method of estimating the population size by multiple census proposed by Schumacher and Eschmeyer [23]. Their method conducts multiple samplings, which correspond to individual's relevance judgments in our case, and estimates the population size, which corresponds to the number of relevant instances in our case. Having estimated the number of relevant instances, we can estimate the fraction of judged relevant instances to all the relevant instances. In our test collection, 62.9% of relevant instances were estimated to be actually judged by the subject. According to the Buckley and Voorhees's work [6], the moderate completeness of our test collection possibly affects the system ranking based on the evaluation metric: the Kendall correlation between the system ranking based on MAP with incomplete relevance judgments and that with complete relevance judgments was 0.9 on average in three test collections from the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC). Although we cannot argue that our test collection is complete and is able to accurately estimate the effectiveness of methods, the effect of the moderate completeness of our test collection is supposed to be small. Moreover, we used an evaluation metric for graded relevance, where relevant instances with a low grade make less impact on the evaluation result than ones with a high grade.

"RCM was almost the same as SVM, since the centroid vector of instances had small values for all the dimensions in our case: the value distribution was flattened by taking an average over all the instance vectors. The TSVM was worse than SVM in many of the search intents, probably because the number of relevant instances per search intent was not balanced across domains, the same label distribution in the source and target domains is assumed with TSVM. SVM showed higher MAP and nDCG@10 than methods using only selected examples, i.e. NNS and OSVM. The difference between SVM and those methods is that SVM did use nonselected examples. Therefore, this result suggests that using not only selected examples but also nonselected examples can improve the search performance of content-based retrieval when most of the relevant instances are selected in the source domain.",1,ad,True
"Our proposed RAP-based domain adaptation method showed considerable improvements of nDCG@10 for search intents 5, 11, and 19.

He cannot eat Italian dishes or drink alcohol. Our maximum budget is 40,000 JPY for three people."" These intents include ambiguous conditions, e.g. a category in search intent 5, and budget in the search intent 11, which can be different in different domains. For example, Japanese restaurants were often judged as relevant in Kyoto for search intent 5, while Western restaurants were usually relevant in Tokyo. As shown in Table 1, Kyoto include many Japanese restaurant and is famous for Japanese-style restaurants because it is one of the oldest cities in Japan. On the other hand, there are many Westernstyle restaurants in Tokyo because it is a modern international city in Japan. The difference in frequent categories might be lessened by RAPs in our proposed method, which leads to high search performance.

"We introduced the problem of domain adaptation for contentbased retrieval, and proposed a domain adaptation method based on RAPs. We developed a test collection for content-based geographic object retrieval, and provided answers to two research questions.",1,ad,True
"The first research question was whether domain adaptation for content-based retrieval is necessary. Our experimental results showed that evaluation metrics in an out-domain setting (D(S) , D(T )) were significantly lower than those in an in-domain setting (D(S) ,"" D(T )). Therefore, we conclude that the answer to the first research question is yes: search performance without domain adaptation significantly decreases when the source and target domains are heterogeneous, and domain adaptation for content-based retrieval is necessary.""",1,ad,True
The second research question was whether domain adaptation based on RAPs can bridge the domain difference and significantly improve the search performance of content-based retrieval in heterogeneous domains. Our experimental results answered the second research question by showing significant improvements over baseline methods.,1,ad,True
"Future work involves applying the RAP-based method to other datasets. In practice, developing a method for finding effective RAPs is the most important part of future work, as it is difficult to find effective RAPs manually. Although we assume that feature spaces in the source and target domains are the same in this paper, it is possible to apply our proposed RAP-based domain adaptation method to heterogeneous feature spaces such as image and music feature spaces. The RAP-based method requires only a withindomain similarity function not a between-domain similarity function for domain adaptation, and enables a user to find popular music by selecting popular pictures. There is also a need to further study the effect of the domain differences, such as the difference between datasets from which the system retrieves data, between search locations, and between user's profiles, on search tasks.",1,AP,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Result merging is an important research problem in federated search for merging documents retrieved from multiple ranked lists of selected information sources into a single list. The state-of-the-art result merging algorithms such as Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Sample-Agglomerate Fitting Estimate (SAFE) try to map document scores retrieved from different sources to comparable scores according to a single centralized retrieval algorithm for ranking those documents. Both SSL and SAFE arbitrarily select a single centralized retrieval algorithm for generating comparable document scores, which is problematic in a heterogeneous federated search environment, since a single centralized algorithm is often suboptimal for different information sources.",0,,False
"Based on this observation, this paper proposes a novel approach for result merging by utilizing multiple centralized retrieval algorithms. One simple approach is to learn a set of combination weights for multiple centralized retrieval algorithms (e.g., logistic regression) to compute comparable document scores. The paper shows that this simple approach generates suboptimal results as it is not flexible enough to deal with heterogeneous information sources. A mixture probabilistic model is thus proposed to learn more appropriate combination weights with respect to different types of information sources with some training data. An extensive set of experiments on three datasets have proven the effectiveness of the proposed new approach.",0,,False

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Federated search (also known as distributed information retrieval) [17, 23, 29] is an important research area of information retrieval. Unlike traditional information search systems such as Google or Bing, which index webpages or documents that can be crawled and collected, federated search targets on information distributed in independent information providers. Many contents in this environment may not be arbitrarily crawled and searched by traditional search engines, due to various reasons such as copyright, security and data protection. Only the owners of those documents can provide a full searching service to their set of documents. We refer to a collection of documents with its own and customized search engine as an information source. The size of this type of information (i.e., hidden Web contents) has been estimated to be many times larger than Web contents searchable by traditional search engines [3].",1,ad,True
"Federated search offers a solution for searching hidden Web contents by building a bridge between users, who have little knowledge about which kind of information sources she is looking for, and the information sources that reveal limited information about their documents through sourcespecific search engines. To achieve this goal, federated search includes three main research problems: resource representation, resource selection and result merging. Resource representation learns important information about the sources such as their contents and their sizes. Resource selection selects a subset of information sources which are most useful for users' queries. Result merging combines documents retrieved from selected sources into a single ranked list before presenting the list to the end users.",0,,False
"Among the above main problems, result merging substantially suffers from the heterogeneity of information sources. Each information source may adopt a different, customized retrieval model. A query can also be processed in many ways. Even if different sources use similar retrieval algorithms, they may have different source statistics (e.g., different values of inverse document frequencies). All of those make it difficult to compare documents of different sources. A simple solution that downloads all document contents and ranks them with a single method for each user query may yield good results, but it is also costly in an online setting.",1,ad,True
821,0,,False
"Other solutions such as downloading parts of the documents [6] or incorporating scores from the resource selection component into source-specific document scores (e.g., CORI [4]) also suffer when information sources do not provide enough information or vary greatly in their scales of document ranking scores.",1,ad,True
"The state-of-the-art result merging algorithms merge documents by learning how to map document scores in ranked lists of multiple information sources to comparable document scores. The basic idea is to utilize a centralized sample database created with all sample documents obtained in resource representation. For each query, these algorithms rank documents in the centralized sample database with a single retrieval algorithm, and then build a mapping function between source-specific document scores (or ranks) and comparable document scores. By mapping document scores/ranks returned from all selected sources to a common scale, it is possible to construct the final ranked list. Algorithms of this class such as SSL [27], SAFE [24] and WCF [12] have shown promising results. However, despite using various learning algorithms, those methods still do not fully address the heterogeneity of retrieval algorithms in different information sources. The problem lies in the fact that all these existing methods arbitrarily select a single fixed centralized retrieval algorithm for learning the mapping, which is problematic in a heterogeneous federated search environment, as a single algorithm is often suboptimal for learning comparable scores for different sources.",1,ad,True
"In this paper, we propose a novel result merging algorithm that utilizes multiple centralized retrieval algorithms. This method can generate more accurate results in result merging due to the flexibility of using multiple types of centralized retrieval algorithms for estimating comparable document scores. In particular, the paper shows that it is not desirable to learn a fixed set of weights (e.g., with a logistic regression approach) for different centralized retrieval algorithms in estimating comparable document scores. A mixture probabilistic model is proposed to automatically learn the appropriate weights for different types of information sources with some training data. The mixture model approach is more flexible in calculating comparable document scores for a heterogeneous set of information sources. Empirical studies have been conducted with three federated search datasets to show the advantages of the proposed result merging algorithm. In particular, one new dataset is created from the Wikipedia collection of ClueWeb data.",1,ad,True

Section 3 discusses two specific state-ofthe-art results merging algorithms (SSL and SAFE) as they are directly related with the proposed research. Section 4 proposes the novel result merging algorithm with multiple centralized retrieval algorithms. Section 5 introduces experimental methodology.

2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
"Federated search includes three main research problems: resource representation, resource selection and result merg-",0,,False
ing. There is a large volume of previous research work in all of those research problems. This section first briefly introduces most related prior research in resource representation and resource selection. Then it will provide more details about the literature of result merging.,0,,False
"Resource representation is to collect information about each information source. Such information usually includes sources' sizes, document frequencies, term frequencies, and other statistics. The START protocol [9] is one of the first attempt to standardize the communication between information sources and a broker (or centralized agent) in order to collect, search and merge documents from individual sources. However, this approach can only work in cooperative environments. In an uncooperative environment, it is more practical to collect source statistics with sampling algorithms. The query-based sampling method [4] is a popular algorithm for sampling documents from a set of information sources. In principal, query-based sampling sends randomly generated terms as queries to a source, and downloads the top documents as sample documents for each query. When this process is done, the set of all sample documents can be collected in a centralized sample database to build a single index. The centralized sample database is often a good representative of the (imaginary) complete database of all documents in a federated search environment.",1,ad,True
"Resource selection is to select a subset of information sources most relevant to the user's query. Resource selection has been studied intensively during the last two decades. Many algorithms have been developed, such as GlOSS [10], CORI [4], ReDDE [26], CRCS [22], topic models [2], the classification-based model [1] and many others. The Relevant Document Distribution Estimation (ReDDE) resource selection algorithm and its variants have been shown to generate good and robust resource selection results in different types of federated search environments. ReDDE selects relevant sources by first ranking sample documents in the centralized sample database. Then, each document among the top of the list can contribute a score to its containing source. The magnitude of the score depends on both document's rank and the source's size. Finally, the relevance of a source is measured by the combined score of all of its sample documents.",1,ad,True
"Result merging is to collect the ranked list of documents from each selected source and combine them into a single ranked list to present to users. Result merging in federated search is similar to data fusion [32, 25], or merging process in multilingual information retrieval [30]. In data fusion, different retrieval models are applied to a single information source, and the problem is to get the best combination of retrieval algorithms. Whereas, in federated search, there are multiple information sources with different (often unknown) retrieval models. Similar to information fusion, multilingual information retrieval also assumes that the whole collection index is available to the merger during the process, which is not always the case in federated search.",0,,False
"One scenario is that the broker can download all returned documents from selected sources, and apply a centralized retrieval algorithm to produce the final ranked list. However, in practice, this method is rarely used since the high cost of communication and time may impair user experience. In another simple case, when all sources implement",1,ad,True
822,0,,False
"the same retrieval model, documents' scores (or ranks) returned by the source may be comparable with each other. Thus, merging their scores (or ranks) directly (also known as Raw Score Merging), or in a round-robin fashion may give good results with low cost. However, it is noticed that even if all sources share the same model, some statistics such as document frequency of a term are still different across different sources. It is generally not practical to assume that all independent sources share such a same set of collection statistics.",0,,False
"Some other algorithms in the early generation of federated search also relied on term statistics for making decision. Craswell et al. suggested that by partially downloading a part of the top returned documents, we can approximate term statistics to build the final rank list [6]. Xu and Croft requested that document statistics of query terms should be provided to the broker, in such a way that they can calculate the global inverse document frequencies [34]. However, these algorithms again require some type of collaboration from the independent sources, which is often unavailable.",1,ad,True
"CORI result merging algorithm [4] is a relatively simple, yet effective algorithm. The intuition is that comparable document scores should depend on two factors: (i) how good a document is compared to other documents from the same source; and (ii) how good the source containing a particular document is compared to other sources. CORI makes a linear combination of those two factors and gets the final score of a document as:",0,,False

1.4,0,,False
"where D is the global score, D is the original score within the source, and C is the normalized source score from the resource selection step.",0,,False
"The merging algorithm proposed by Rasolofo et al. [19] also explores the combination between document scores and source weights. Unlike CORI, their source weights are not directly related with the sources' relevance scores. Rather, the weight of a source depends on the total number of documents that it returns. The algorithm assumes that a source containing more relevant documents may return a longer ranked list, which is not always the case for information sources using different types of ranking algorithms.",0,,False
"The intuition of combining document and resource scores can also be seen in a variant of the PageRank algorithm in distributed environments [31]. In this work, Wang and DeWitt employed the source's ServerRank and the document's LocalRank to derive the global PageRank values.",0,,False
Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) [27] and the Sample Agglomerate Fitting Estimate (SAFE) [24] result merging algorithms offer a better trade-off in efficiency and effectiveness. Both methods try to map source-specific document ranks into comparable document scores generated by a single centralized retrieval algorithm. We will provide more detailed information about SSL and SAFE in the following section as they are directly related with the new research in this paper.,1,ad,True

"Semi-Supervised Learning Merging (SSL) [27] uses curve fitting model to calculate comparable document scores from different sources for result merging. Specifically, given a user's query, SSL sends the query to the centralized sample database and retrieves the sample ranked list with relevance score of each document. Upon receiving documents from a selected information source, SSL checks for overlapping documents exist in the sample database. Those overlapping documents are characterized by two features: the relevance scores in the central sample database, and the relevance ranks in the specific source. The task is to estimate the relevance scores of all non-overlapping documents in the centralized complete database (the imaginary dataset of all documents of all sources). Assume that there is a linear mapping between centralized relevance scores and sourcespecific document ranks, then that mapping can be inferred by using a regression method on the overlapping documents. Having said that, let Rij be the source-specific rank of document di in source Cj, and Sij be the relevance score of document di in the centralized sample database, we can build a linear relationship.",0,,False

4. MIXTURE OF RETRIEVAL MODELS FOR RESULT MERGING,0,,False
"SSL and SAFE are state-of-the-art algorithms for result merging in federated search. However, because of their choosing of a single centralized retrieval algorithm for calculating comparable document scores, these algorithms still do not fully address the heterogeneity of different information sources in federated search environments . A single centralized retrieval algorithm may have good curve-fittings for some information sources, but may also be less fit for some others. This paper proposes to use multiple centralized retrieval algorithms to retrieve a set of ranking scores for each document. Moreover, rather than assigning a fixed set of weights to combine the above scores, our model learns a more appropriate combination of weights with respect to different types of information sources. We assume that there is an underlying distribution (i.e., latent groups) of sources according to their adopted retrieval models. Learning the proposed model thus becomes learning the distribution of groups and the combination weights associated with each group. This model is called the Mixture of Retrieval Models (MoRM) for result merging. MoRM is related with SSL and SAFE in the way that it uses the centralized sam-",1,ad,True

7. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK,0,,False
"This paper proposes a novel method of mixture model with multiple centralized retrieval algorithms for result merging in federated search. Existing result merging algorithms do not fully address the issue of heterogeneity of information sources in federated search. Their arbitrary choices of a single centralized retrieval algorithm suffer from the fact that information sources are inherently different in source statistics, query processing techniques, and/or document retrieval algorithms. The proposed model attempts to combine various evidence from multiple centralized retrieval algorithms in a mixture model framework, in order to map source-specific document ranks to comparable scores for result merging. We have shown that a single set of combination weights of the evidence do not offer enough flexibility in dealing with such a heterogeneous environment. A mixture model that learns multiple sets of combination weights according to the clusters of sources proves to be a better choice. A set of experiments has been conducted with two traditional TREC datasets and a new dataset based on the ClueWeb. The empirical results in three datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed mixture model with multiple centralized retrieval algorithms.",1,ad,True
"This model could be extended in many ways. For instance, we could add more flexibility to the model by cus-",1,ad,True
"tomizing the prior distribution k independently for each source, which means a source will be associated with a set of combination weights independent of the others. However, this model could require a larger training dataset to learn the parameters. A hybrid model where a cluster of similar sources independently uses multiple sets of weights is more feasible. The similarity between sources will play an important factor in creating those clusters. Another direction is to build a mixture model based on cluster of queries instead of cluster of sources, in which each query will trigger a different set of combination weights of all features. Furthermore, we can combine both of the above methods. It is also interesting to explore other types of evidence, such as the links between documents from different sources and incorporate them into the learning model.",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Distributed search engines comprise multiple sites deployed across geographically distant regions, each site being specialized to serve the queries of local users. When a search site cannot accurately compute the results of a query, it must forward the query to other sites. This paper considers the problem of selecting the documents indexed by each site focusing on replication to increase the fraction of queries processed locally. We propose RIP, an algorithm for replicating documents and posting lists that is practical and has two important features. RIP evaluates user interests in an online fashion and uses only local data of a site. Being an online approach simplifies the operational complexity, while locality enables higher performance when processing queries and documents. The decision procedure, on top of being online and local, incorporates document popularity and user queries, which is critical when assuming a replication budget for each site. Having a replication budget reflects the hardware constraints of any given site. We evaluate RIP against the approach of replicating popular documents statically, and show that we achieve significant gains, while having the additional benefit of supporting incremental indexes.",1,corpora,True

"several search sites deployed in (smaller) data centers spread across the world. Each search site only indexes a fraction of the documents, and receives the queries of the users in its region. When a query cannot be answered locally, it is forwarded to the other sites in order to compute accurate responses [2, 8]. Distributed search engines share the workload among several sites. Thus, deploying an extra site in a new data center increases the capacity of the search engine.",1,ad,True
"Designing an efficient distributed search engine is a challenging task. Traditional search engine algorithms rely on all the resources being accessed within a single data center. However, in the case of distributed search, the index is split among several distant locations. Accessing data in another search site translates into a higher response time due to network latency. Ideally, a site processes most queries locally to offer low response time and avoid the cost of processing the query in several sites. To enable this property, a careful selection of the documents to index on each site becomes necessary to guarantee that most frequently requested documents can be retrieved locally. A trivial solution is of course to replicate all documents across all sites. This solution, however desirable from a latency perspective, induces a high utilization of computer resources. Consequently, an important goal is to reduce resource utilization while providing low latency to end users through local query processing.",1,ad,True
"Brefeld et al. use machine-learning techniques to assign each document to one or multiple sites [4]. Their approach, however, does not consider the popularity of documents or a resource budget for each site. The popularity of documents becomes important when having to selectively drop documents due to resource constraints. Following a different approach, Blanco et al. propose to assign each document to a single site, and later rely on user activity to proceed to documents replication [3]. Their method relies on terms distribution and cache invalidations of a document to predict at which search site it is most likely to be requested. However, they do not propose any replication strategy.",0,,False
"Upon receiving a query, a search site processes it against its local index and then estimates whether other sites may have better documents, in which case the query is forwarded. Several heuristics have been developed for estimating the quality of documents in different sites. They rely on some partial knowledge of the content of the other search sites, either per-term score thresholds [2], or the scores of previously processed queries [8].

2.1 Traditional search engine architecture,1,ad,True
"The architecture of a search engine is typically divided into three components. The crawler fetches documents from the Web and discovers new content by following hypertext links. The indexer processes D, the collection of documents, to generate an inverted index. For each term t present in the collection, the inverted index contains a posting list, i.e., a list of the documents that contain t. A popular technique for implementing an index is incremental indexing. Incremental indexing enables the addition, deletion, or update of indexed documents without fully regenerating the index. This fea-",1,ad,True
"ture is particularly important in the case of large scale Web search engines where the cost of regenerating the full index to update frequently modified Web pages (e.g. news) is prohibitive. Incremental indexes offer a good trade-off between the freshness of the documents and the processing performance. Hence, in this paper, we consider the case of an incremental indexer. The query processor receives user queries and processes them against the index. Historically, commercial Web search engines have preferred conjunctive query processing [14]: a document has to contain all the terms in the query to be in the result set. To obtain the result set, the query processor computes the intersection of the posting lists of the query terms, evaluating the scores of the documents using a ranking function. The k (typically 10) results with the highest scores are returned to the user.",1,ad,True
2.2 Assignment of documents to sites,0,,False
"In a distributed search engine, each search site has its own index and processes the queries of the users in its region. It is therefore important to carefully select documents to index in each site to tailor the data structures of the sites for their users. For a short response time, a search site must be able to process most of the queries it receives using its local index alone. Indexing documents that are popular in a region enables locality. However, it is also important to limit the number of documents indexed at each site. The query processing latency in fact increases with the size of the index [5]. Furthermore, replicating a large fraction of the documents at each site limits the scalability of the search engine. In this work, we assume that each search site has a fixed index capacity, either due to limited resources, or arbitrarily chosen to reduce the processing time. We express this limit using number of postings, i.e., the sum of the length of all the posting lists in the index.",0,,False
"To the extent of our knowledge, two approaches have been developed to compute an assignment of documents to search sites. The first one relies on machine learning algorithms to analyze new documents upon their discovery and assigns them to one or more search sites [4]. The second one assigns each document to a single master site [3]. This assignment results in a minimal index, with each document indexed in a single location. The master site of a document is responsible for maintaining it in its index, which guarantees that the distributed search engine has the same recall as a centralized implementation. Our work builds up on the master selection approach [3]. We assume the existence of an algorithm that assigns each document to a single search site. Hence, the search site Si has a master index MIi which indexes all the documents Si is the master of. Typically, this index represents the majority of Si's index capacity.",0,,False
"The popularity of Web pages typically follows a power law: while most of the Web pages are unpopular, a few of them are requested very frequently. A Web page might present high locality, being popular in a single region, or be popular across many regions. Distributed search engines work better in a context where documents have a strong locality. Indeed, this means that each document only needs to be indexed by the search site located in the region where it is popular. Fortunately, a large fraction of the popular Web pages exhibit a high divergence in their popularity across regions [3]. Nevertheless, there are still documents which are popular across region boundaries and are requested by users",0,,False

"In this paper, we propose RIP, a Reactive Indexing Protocol. RIP uses part of the remaining index capacity of each search site to replicate documents that are frequently requested locally, but were assigned to a different search site by the master selection algorithm. Contrary to the master selection algorithm, which only relies on the content of the document, RIP is reactive: it analyzes the behavior of the users at each site to dynamically adjust replication decisions. These fully replicated documents form the shadow index, denoted SIi for the site Si.",1,ad,True
2.3 Distributed query processing,0,,False
"In a distributed search engine, a search site indexes locally only a fraction of the documents. To preserve the quality of results, a distributed search engine must generate the same results as a centralized implementation. A query submitted to a site Si must be evaluated on the full set of documents D, whether they are indexed locally (MIi and SIi) or not. So far, the main approach to executing queries in a distributed search engine relies upon query forwarding [2, 8]. When processing a query, a search site first computes results using its local index, and then relies on a forwarding heuristic to determine whether another site may be able to provide higher quality results. If there are such sites according to the evaluation of the heuristic, then the query is forwarded to the relevant search sites for further processing. Finally, the results are then merged and returned to the user.",0,,False
"The forwarding heuristic is conservative with respect to query forwarding, and it can generate false positives, but no false negatives. As already mentioned in Section 2.2, it is preferable to answer a query locally, since it reduces the response time. It is therefore important to devise an accurate forwarding heuristic to reduce the forwarding rate.",1,ad,True
"Existing forwarding heuristics [2, 8] leverage properties of the search engine ranking function to compute an upper bound on the score of documents which are not indexed locally. This ranking function s(d|q), presented on Figure 2, was introduced by Baeza-Yates et al. [2]. The score of a document d is computed by averaging partial scores over the terms of the query q. A document d has a quality score, expressed by f (d), and a relevance score for a term t, computed by g(d|t). The parameters wf and wg weight quality and relevance respectively. The partial score of a document d for a term t, expressed as r(d|t), is typically maintained in the posting lists of the index to improve query evaluation performance. Note that distributed search engines are compatible with more complex ranking functions, including positional features, machine learning and diversification. In these cases, the s(d|q) ranking function is used in the first phase of a two-phase ranking [9], which ensures that relevant documents will be known locally before the execution of the second phase of the ranking.",0,,False

Shadow index SIi: It contains documents that are fully replicated by Si. They were assigned to one of the other search sites by the master selection algorithm, but are replicated to improve the query processing locality. Forwarding index FIi: It contains partial information about documents assigned to the other search sites. For a given term t, the posting list associated to t in FIi contains the list of documents that have the highest partial scores for t. Documents having high partial scores are also likely to have a high popularity. Hence, SIi and FIi may overlap.",1,ad,True
"These logical indexes represent the data available to Si for processing queries. The posting lists of search engines are, in most cases, ordered by document ID. This allows high compression rates, and is particularly efficient for conjunctive query processing [14]. In this work, we do not make any assumption on the layout of MIi and SIi. However, we present FIi as an index sorted by impact. This means that the postings are ordered by partial scores. This assumption simplifies the description of the algorithm, but there is, in practice, no reason not to implement these three indexes as a single incremental index relying on document ID ordered posting lists.",0,,False

A sequence of queries is submitted to each search site and the goal is to maximize the amount of queries that are answered locally, without query forwarding.

Part of the computational cost of the problem presented in Section 3.1 arises from the fact that the benefit of replicating a document cannot be simply evaluated, it depends on the full selection of replicated documents. From this consideration, it would be tempting to devise a solution based on hypergraphs of documents and queries to model replication dependencies. However, given the scale of the document collections we consider, such data structures do not scale, both with respect to their memory consumption and the processing cost required to exploit them.",0,,False
"Inspired by previous work in Web caches [13], we propose a Reactive Indexing Protocol (RIP).

Based on these observations, our algorithm evaluates the utility of replicating information. A search site Si may either replicate documents, to ensure that the results are copied locally, or fragments of the posting lists of other sites, to increase its knowledge of their document collection and make more accurate query forwarding predictions by computing tighter score bounds.

3.3.1 Forwarding heuristic,0,,False
"The forwarding heuristic we propose stems from the NRA top-k processing algorithms [11], with a few adaptations to deal with incomplete posting lists. In NRA, posting lists are sorted by impact and processed from top to bottom. NRA maintains a sorted heap of potential top-k results with upper and lower bounds on their scores. These bounds are updated as the processing progresses down the posting lists. As soon as the upper bound of the (k + 1)th document is lower than the lower bound of the kth document, the topk results are identified and the algorithm terminates. In the worst case, NRA has to process the full posting lists, but, in most situations, it achieves significant performance gains and only processes a small fraction of the index. The forwarding heuristic performs a similar computation. It processes the query over the forwarding index FIi and computes upper bounds on scores. The posting lists of the forwarding index are only partial, but they are continuous. A posting list replicated by Si for a term t down to the score value v contains all the documents of D whose master is different from Si and whose partial score r(d|t) is higher than v. Therefore, for a given term, FIi provides either an exact partial score, or an upper bound equal to the score of the last posting list entry. While processing, the forwarding heuristic",1,ad,True

This document is also present in the posting list of t2, so we will also find its exact partial score for t2 as the top-k execution progresses. However, d555 is not represented in the posting list of t3. The last known document of this posting list is d135. As a consequence, we use its partial score as an upper bound of d555's partial score for t3. Hence, the upper bound score computed for d555 is (23.1+17.3+14.9)/3,""18.4. We can also compute a bound on the score of any document absent from these posting lists using the scores of the last entries (22.8, 16.7 and 14.9 in this example).

For incremental indexes, it is possible for a results cache to return stale results, which happens when the result set does not reflect accurately the current state of the index.

In this case, FI contains an upper bound per term for non replicated documents, which corresponds to the thresholds of Baeza-Yates et al. [2]. Reactive documents replication (RDR): Each search site reactively determines which documents are most frequently part of the results of their users and replicate the most popular ones. This setup computes a different set of replicated documents for each site to match the activities of their users. As with SDR, FI contains one bound per term, dynamically adjusted to reflect document replication. Reactive Indexing Protocol (RIP): Each site reactively replicates blocks of documents and posting lists, as well as individual documents when they generate false positives. This is the approach we describe in Section 3.3.3. Each site replicates data matching the needs of its users, while preserving the continuity of information in posting lists.",1,ad,True

With a replication budget of 1,000,000 documents, each search site has an average indexing capacity of 7,119,982 documents (22.5% of the total collection), which represents an overhead of 14% over a setup without any replication. In this configuration, RIP raises the amount of queries processed locally by 23%, while RDR raises it by 13%. Note that the  parameter of RIP, used to compute replication thresholds, is set to 0.6.

Given that one-term queries are less likely to be unique, the temperature of their results increases over time and they are replicated. However, when the replication budget increases, it becomes more interesting to also replicate data for longer queries. The results show that RDR is unable to answer these queries, even with a large budget. The documents that are part of the results may be replicated. However, given that the corresponding posting lists are not replicated, the search engine is unable to ensure that the query results are optimal, and the forwarding heuristic returns a false positive.

These cases constitute false positives, as forwarding the query does not modify its results.

We display, on Figure 12, the distribution of true and false positives (ROC curve [12]). As one-term queries only involve one posting list, making it impossible to generate a false positive, we ignore them in this experiment.

As shown in Section 4.2, the documents users are interested in significantly differ across regions. Thus, it is more efficient to perform fine grain replication, and select different replicated documents for each search site. Our experiments presented in Section 4.3 show that per-site replication algorithms systematically outperform global replication decisions.",0,,False
"Brefeld et al. propose to use machine-learning techniques to statically assign documents to search sites [4]. This approach optimizes the replication of documents for each site, but it relies on attributes, such as the language of the document, which are weakly correlated with its popularity. Contrary to this approach, the algorithm we propose is reactive, and only replicates documents when it observes that users actually request them. The algorithm we propose also explicitly prioritizes pieces of replicated data depending on their size and temperature. The approach of Brefeld et al. relies on an algorithm that simply assigns documents to search sites, and it does not enable an operator to vary the indexing capacity.",0,,False

In the case of a static index, these bounds can easily be computed during the generation of the index, and do not vary at runtime. However, when the index and the set of replicated documents are dynamically selected, these bounds need to be updated. This process can become particularly costly when",0,,False

The approach we propose explicitly maintains two bounds per term, which is a reasonable trade-off between their accuracy and the maintenance cost.",1,ad,True
"The main difference between the algorithms we propose and previous work [7, 8] is the interaction between the replication algorithm and the forwarding heuristic. While other algorithms focus on replicating popular documents, our approach also maintains single posting lists elements to ensure the continuity of the information on the scores for a given term. As there is no ""hole"" in the forwarding index, the upper bounds for each term are lower. In addition, by replicating postings further, we efficiently lower the bounds computed for longer queries. Overall, this significantly reduces the amount of query forwarding.",1,ad,True

By maintaining upper bounds on the partial scores of compressed posting list segments, they significantly reduce both the amount of computation and the processing time. Our approach for block replication could be adapted to replicate document ID-ordered blocks using these thresholds. However, this would lead to a significant overhead for storing the index, since documents obtaining low scores would also be replicated if they belong to a segment with a high threshold. Consequently, we opted for strictly following the order of partial scores to replicate information.",1,ad,True

"We propose RIP, a Reactive Indexing Protocol for distributed search engines. With RIP, the search engine initially indexes each document on a single master site, and monitors the local user activity of each site to generate an index replication scheme. Our scheme replicates documents and fragments of posting lists. RIP enables a significant reduction of the amount of query forwarding between search sites, and consequently, of query processing latency. We show experimentally that, by making local decisions, RIP significantly outperforms previous replication strategies based on global information: in a 5-site setup, when each site has an index capacity of 22.5% of the documents collection, 60% of the queries are processed locally. We also show that replicating fragments of posting lists allows the query forwarding heuristic to compute lower score thresholds on unknown documents, which increases performance. Finally, RIP has by design the additional benefit of being an online approach, supporting both incremental indexing and a precise index capacity configuration, which simplifies operations in a production environment.",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Search personalization and diversification are often seen as opposing alternatives to cope with query uncertainty, where, given an ambiguous query, it is either preferable to adapt the search result to a specific aspect that may interest the user (personalization) or to regard multiple aspects in order to maximize the probability that some query aspect is relevant to the user (diversification). In this work, we question this antagonistic view, and hypothesize that these two directions may in fact be effectively combined and enhance each other. We research the introduction of the user as an explicit random variable in state of the art diversification methods, thus developing a generalized framework for personalized diversification. In order to evaluate our hypothesis, we conduct an evaluation with real users using crowdsourcing services. The obtained results suggest that the combination of personalization and diversification achieves competitive performance, improving the baseline, plain personalization, and plain diversification approaches in terms of both diversity and accuracy measures.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Maximizing the total returned relevance in response to an information need has been traditionally the main fundamental principle underlying research and development in the Information Retrieval (IR) field. More recently, strands of research in the community considered other angles of the practical effectiveness of the output of retrieval systems, and the role that diversity, in particular, plays along with relevance in delivering effective value to the users of such systems [5,6,22]. The value of IR diversity is motivated by the uncertainty involved in a single query as the only evidence of the user information need [1,7,15,16]. The assumption is that different users may mean slightly (or even quite) different things by the same query expression. In the absence of further knowledge or observations about the actual user need beyond the",1,ad,True

"explicit query, the goal of the diversity approach is to satisfy as many users as possible with a single result set. More specifically, diversification aims to minimize the number of totally unsatisfied users, trading degrees of satisfaction in exchange for increasing the size of the ­at least minimally­ satisfied population. The implicit assumption is that the loss involved in zero vs. small utility is far more significant than the loss involved between degrees of satisfaction. In other words, relevance follows a diminishing marginal returns pattern, where the gain obtained from increased relevance decreases fast with the number of relevant documents [14,21].",1,ad,True
"This view contrasts with the principles behind personalization. IR personalization takes the same starting point and addresses the same problem as diversity, where a sole query is viewed as an insufficient expression of the full and precise user need. But in contrast with diversification, the personalization approach strives to get further knowledge beyond the query, so as to explicitly tackle and overcome ­to the degree this is possible­ the initial uncertainty [9,11,12,18]. The uncertainty is reduced by extracting and exploiting further information from a wide variety of observations and resources, such as session feedback from the user, longterm records of user behavior, user stereotypes, social links, and other sources for user context and interest modeling. While in the diversity approach the system accepts and adapts its behavior to a situation of uncertainty, personalization tries to change this situation by enhancing the system knowledge about the user need. Rather than aiming to satisfy as many users as possible, personalization aims to build, in a way, a sense of who the user is, and maximize the satisfaction for the specific sensed user.",1,ad,True
"From these considerations, it might seem natural to see diversity and personalization as contradictory approaches. One might understand that by opting for diversity, the adaptation of results to specific users has been implicitly given up on. Conversely, if the query uncertainty is reduced by grasping the user context, the reason for diversification may have been done away with to some extent. In this paper we contend, however, that diversity and personalization are not necessarily incompatible or mutually exclusive goals, but on the contrary they may complement and in fact enhance each other.",1,ad,True
"Our research is motivated by the understanding that personalization is a process that involves itself a great deal of uncertainty, considerably higher, in fact, than ad-hoc search. The observation of implicit evidence of interest from users involves indeed much higher degrees of ambiguity and incompleteness than regular queries. The interpretation of the input for personalization is an explicit and inherent ­and considerably difficult­ part of the personalization task. The same observed contextual cues may fit several plausible interpretations whereby, by the same rationale as for search diversification, diversifying the system's assumptions may help minimize the ratio of severe failures in guessing the implicit user interests. Moreover, the observations of user behav-",1,ad-hoc,True

"ior and preferences available to the system usually cover a small fraction of the full range of user interests, whereby context representations are far more incomplete than queries as expressions of user needs. Furthermore, the same as search diversity considers notions of aspects and facets in user queries and needs, user interests are typically heterogeneous, whereby the consideration of user profile aspects for diversification can be as natural as is the introduction of query aspects.",0,,False
"In this paper we develop a generalization of existing diversification approaches, by adding a personalization component into them. Specifically, we introduce a user random variable in probabilistic diversification models previously developed in the literature on IR diversity [1,16]. We describe in detail a full approach to develop the resulting framework into computable components. We report experiments with real users where our framework is compared to partial approaches that apply either personalization or diversification alone. We also compare our approach to a previous approximation to diversity and personalization combined [13]. Our approach compares favorably to all such alternatives, thus providing an empiric validation of our hypothesis.",1,ad,True

Experimental results are presented in section 6, followed by a brief discussion of related work in section 7.

"2. DIVERSITY AND PERSONALIZATION, AN INTEGRATED VIEW",0,,False
"The vision of combining diversity and personalization opens a rich area for research, barely explored to date. Diversity and personalization are complementary and can play together in different ways. The likes and preferences of people typically comprise quite diverse areas of interest, therefore not all of one's preferences should come into play in a specific retrieval task. The activation of the right preference area is critical for the performance of a personalization technique. Areas of user interest are often related to different contexts (work, leisure, time, tasks, situations, etc.). Choosing the wrong area is the typical cause of personalization intrusiveness ­ the Achilles' heel of personalization: the inferred preferences may be right, but they are applied at the wrong time.",0,,False
Figure 1. Diversity and personalization as complementary dimensions.,0,,False
"Diversity and personalization may interact and be combined in different ways to enhance each other. For instance, the personalization system may use a diversified selection of user interests, to cope with the uncertainty about which are most pertinent to the current context. Likewise, personalization can improve the effectiveness of aspect weighting in diversification, by favoring query",0,,False
"interpretations which are predicted to be more related to each specific user. Besides interacting with each other, personalization and diversification can of course be directly applied to the search system. Which combination of the three components (diversity, personalization, and search system) is more appropriate may depend on a number of factors, including the characteristics of the query, the system knowledge about the user context, and relations between both. For instance, to the extent that user preferences are unrelated to the query, it may be advisable to apply them to the diversification component, and to little or no extent to the accuracy-seeking component. And so forth.",1,ad,True
"As a noteworthy example of the combination of diversity and personalization, diversity has been an actively researched topic in the Recommender Systems field in the last decade (see e.g. [19,20,23,24]). Recommendation is a genuine personalized retrieval task, but interestingly, one in which the explicitly query is absent, and only implicit evidence of user interests are available to the retrieval system. To this respect, our research vision is new in relation to prior work in that we deal with the problem of handling user preferences, the diversity dimension, and a query, altogether. Also interestingly, recommendation diversity has only been researched by similarity-based methods, devoid of an explicit representation of user intents (with the exception of [23]). In contrast, we shall consider an explicitly intent-oriented approach.",1,ad,True
"Figure 1 illustrates the complementarity of diversity and personalization in query-based search. Personalization is useful to focus the scope of diversification within a closer scope to general user interests (area 1 in the figure). Still, a fraction of user-neutral diversity beyond this may be appropriate (area 5). This fraction can be made variable and dependent on the degree of uncertainty in the system's knowledge about user preferences. Similarly, depending on this uncertainty, the diversification of user preferences should be more appropriate or less ­e.g. diversity of personalization is less appropriate if the area 1 in the figure is much larger than the area labeled 2, and it is more beneficial in the opposite situation.",1,ad,True

"The approach we investigate here consists of the introduction of the user as an explicit random variable in the diversification models. We take as starting point the original formulations of two representative intent-oriented diversification algorithms, namely IA-Select [1] and xQuAD [15,16], characterized by using an explicit representation of query intents for diversification. Other diversification schemes not explicitly using aquery aspect space [5,6,21,22] might be generalized as well towards personalized versions, which we envision as future work.",0,,False
"As a starting point and general principle in our approach, a user random variable is introduced in every model component as a complement of the query and aspect variables in the representation of user needs. In practical terms, with respect to the original non-personalized methods, the resulting expressions give rise to new and/or additional model terms requiring handling and estimation, as we shall see. We shall deal with and provide approaches for them. On the other hand, the user-based formulation provides for considering independence assumptions at different points, which result in different variants of the framework, standing for different angles on personalized diversification, as we shall see.",1,ad,True

The inverse frequency of a tag,  can be computed by counting how many users have a specific tag in their profile. For the latter calculation, we used a small training collection of 3,000 users, randomly sampled from Delicious. The advantages of using a source of this nature for document and user profile representation is threefold: first, it is a simple solution to having user and document profiles represented in the same term space model; second, folksonomies offer a more concise way of representing content, facilitating the computation of our model; and third, it facilitates the evaluation of our approaches, by providing us with a publicly-available user profiling resource, sparing the need for sophisticated profile learning techniques.",1,ad,True

Our framework instantiation estimates involve heterogeneous sources and systems, such as an external baseline search system, social annotations, and an external classification service. The use of such third-party tools and resources makes normalization all the more necessary. For this purpose we use a distributionbased normalization approach described by Fernandez et al [8].

As a solution to this problem, we investigated an automatic topic creation methodology, which uses the social profile of the worker in order to find test topics known to the worker. In order to extract topics from the Delicious profile, we adapted to our online evaluation setup an offline evaluation technique initially suggested by Vallet et al. [18].",1,Wiki,True

The ODP classes were cut down to level 3 in the ODP taxonomy ( Top / Level 1 / Level 2 / Level 3). This annotation extraction and document classification process provides the information needed to compute the personalization and diversification estimates of our studied approaches, respectively.

"Our evaluation framework, however, has to additionally consider the personalization and diversification factors involved in our research. Regarding diversification, Agrawal et al. [1] required workers to manually classify results over a predefined set of ODP categories, representing the subtopics that could possibly be related to a search query. The goal was to obtain a result/topic relevance assessment that could be used to evaluate a diversification approach in terms of both accuracy and diversification metrics. In our setup, in addition to this type of assessment, we also needed to obtain a personal relevance assessment, i.e., to which degree a search result is preferred subjectively by the assessor. This value allows us to measure the accuracy of the personalization techniques with respect to the real interest of the user. Our evaluation framework is based on prior early work [17], which focused on the acquisition of personal assessments from workers, and has been adapted to include diversification factors. The main difference between our evaluation methodology and the one presented by Alonso and Baeza [2,3] is that our assessments are subjective to the worker, thus relevance assessments cannot be compared across workers, as they evaluate specific topics related to their profile, according to their personal interests and their own notion of relevance to the topic.",1,ad,True

However, the other variation, PIA-SelectBM25, which uses BM25 as personalized estimation factor, appears to perform much better.

We see the expected decrease in performance as measured by nDCG values for the plain diversification approaches (IA-Select, xQuAD). It comes as somewhat unexpected that the best value is obtained by a personalized diversification approach, PxQuADBM25, which is supposed to affect diversity negatively, but that even reaches statistical significance with respect to the baseline.

7. RELATED WORK,0,,False
"To the best of our knowledge, only Radlinski and Dumais [13] have previously investigated a possible combination of personalization and diversification approaches in Web search. They present a two-stage approach: given an initial user query, the search results are first diversified by executing related sub-queries, taken from query reformulations. In a second step, results are personalized using the user profile. Their hypothesis is that by diversifying results there is a higher chance of encountering documents that satisfy the user's interests. In our evaluation, we included a technique based on their two stage approach (xQuADBM25). In our experiments this approach did not achieve significant improvements over plain personalization, and it was outperformed by our personalized diversification approaches. A possible explanation is that the basic personalized approach was applied to the search baseline, which already had competitive diversity performance. Another explanation would be that their approach may further benefit from diversification techniques based on sub-queries, which were not tested in our experiments.",1,ad,True
"In our work, we exploit social annotation profiles in order to apply personalization factors related to a Web search. The use of a source of information of this type for Web personalization was first suggested by Noll and Meiner [12], who evaluated with real users the use of Delicious user profiles to personalize search, proving the effectiveness of the approach with a simple personalization model.

The authors proposed to use the user's search query to activate concepts within the ODP taxonomy, performing a sort of ""contextualization"" of user preferences. These preferences are then used to compute the personalization factor to be applied on the search output. Their evaluation, which used the framework presented by Vallet et al., indicated an improvement over the state of the art approaches. In our work, we treated the ODP and tag information as independent sources of information. In future work we will analyze whether relating tags to ODP concepts has a positive impact on personalized diversification approaches.",1,ODP,True
8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK,0,,False
"In this work we have presented a number of approaches that combine both personalization and diversification components. To this end, we have investigated the introduction of the user as an explicit random variable in two state of the art diversification models: IA-Select [1] and xQuAD [15,16]. Our experiments show that there is a clear benefit in introducing this variable, achieving statistically significant improvements over the baselines that range between 3%-11% in terms accuracy values, and between 3%-8% in terms of diversity values.",0,,False
"These results lead us to conclude that diversification has a case even in the presence of personalization. Personalization in diversity can be seen in two ­to some degree equivalent­ ways: a) concentrating the extent of diversification in the areas of user interests, and b) seeking relevance to as diverse sides of user preferences as possible. We identify three situations in which our approaches have a potential benefit: 1) user preferences are not necessarily relevant for the query at hand, therefore they may remove uncertainty from it to very variable degrees (from a little to none at all); 2) the system knowledge about user preferences is incomplete (restricted to the observed user activity within the system) and imprecise (evidence of preferences can be implicit, indirect, ambiguous), whereby diversifying the effect of personalization reduces its involved risk; 3) user preferences are themselves diverse, therefore for lack of knowledge about which are most relevant in a given context, it is appropriate to diversify the relevance to the different preference aspects. A similar case as is made for diversification on query intents can thus be made for preference aspects.",1,ad,True
"We have presented different alternatives to estimate the components that arise from the formal development of our scheme, and we evaluated a number of them. Future work may include further investigation on these alternatives. We have tested two estimation approaches for the user/document and document/category relations, based on social annotations (Delicious) and ODP classification (Textwise), respectively. Other ways of approximating these values could be investigated, such as other sources of social profiles (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) or other sources of user profile information (e.g. query and browsing history). Other alternatives for document classification (e.g. clustering, or query reformulations [16]) might be",1,ODP,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"A diversified search result for an underspecified query generally contains web pages in which there are answers that are relevant to different aspects of the query. In order to help the user locate such relevant answers, we propose a simple extension to the standard Search Engine Result Page (SERP) interface, called AspecTiles. In addition to presenting a ranked list of URLs with their titles and snippets, AspecTiles visualizes the relevance degree of a document to each aspect by means of colored squares (""tiles""). To compare AspecTiles with the standard SERP interface in terms of usefulness, we conducted a user study involving 30 search tasks designed based on the TREC web diversity task topics as well as 32 participants. Our results show that AspecTiles has some advantages in terms of search performance, user behavior, and user satisfaction. First, AspecTiles enables the user to gather relevant information significantly more efficiently than the standard SERP interface for tasks where the user considers several different aspects of the query to be important at the same time (multi-aspect tasks). Second, AspecTiles affects the user's information seeking behavior: with this interface, we observed significantly fewer query reformulations, shorter queries and deeper examinations of ranked lists in multiaspect tasks. Third, participants of our user study found AspecTiles significantly more useful for finding relevant information and easy to use than the standard SERP interface. These results suggest that simple interfaces like AspecTiles can enhance the search performance and search experience of the user when their queries are underspecified.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Search queries are often ambiguous (""office"" may mean a workplace or a Microsoft product) or underspecified (""harry potter"" may mean the books, the films or the main character) [7]. Given such queries, search result diversification aims to cover different search intents of the query in a single ranked list of retrieved documents [1]. We are particularly interested in underspecified queries as every query is arguably underspecified to some extent unless it is a perfect representation of the underlying information need. One possible way to explicitly represent these different intents would be to use information types, which we refer to as aspects1. For example, desired aspects of an underspecified query ""elliptical trainer"" (a stationary exercise machine) may include product names, benefits and reviews. The present study concerns what kind of interface would be effective for presenting a diversified ranked list of results obtained in response to such a query.",0,,False
"An underspecified query may possibly represent an information need for a specific aspect of a topic or for various aspects of a topic. For example, with the aforementioned ""elliptical trainer"" query, the user may be looking for product names of the elliptical trainer, or he may be looking for not only product names, but also benefits and reviews of elliptical trainers. Thus, we make a distinction between single-aspect tasks and multi-aspect tasks in our study. This is because the effectiveness of a search result presentation interface may depend on the variety of aspects that the user desires. Another possible viewpoint for categorizing search tasks would be the number of relevant answers the user requires (e.g. home page findings vs. recall-oriented search) [3, 17], but this study primarily concerns",0,,False

"To help the user efficiently and effectively locate retrieved relevant answers that match the desired aspects within the Search Engine Result Page (SERP), we propose a simple extension to the standard SERP interface, which we call AspecTiles. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the AspecTiles interface. As can be seen, AspecTiles visualizes which of the ranked web pages are relevant to which aspects by means of colored squares (""tiles"") that are shown to the left of each document in the SERP. Moreover, the color represents the degree of relevance to an aspect. We believe that this line of research is important but missing in current search result diversification studies: even though most diversification systems rely on explicit identification of different search intents, a standard SERP interface does not tell the user which document is likely to be relevant to which of the intents, and to what degree. We hypothesized that a more informative interface such as AspecTiles will help web search engine users.",0,,False
"In this study, we conduct a user study involving 30 search tasks designed based on the TREC web diversity task topics as well as 32 participants to address the following Research Questions:",1,TREC,True

· RQ2: Does AspecTiles affect the user's information seeking behavior? In what way?,0,,False
"RQ1 is the central question addressed in this paper. Compared to the standard SERP interface, AspecTiles provides the additional information of which documents are relevant to which aspects and to what degree. Thus, we expect the user to quickly scan the ranked list and locate relevant documents that match the desired aspects. Moreover, we would like to clarify under what conditions AspecTiles can be beneficial. For example, it is possible that AspecTiles may be more useful for multi-aspect tasks than for single-aspect tasks, as it can highlight the difference between a document that covers multiple aspects and one that covers only one aspect. Moreover, other factors such as the number of tiles displayed, the quality of the aspects represented as tiles and the accuracy of the estimated degree of relevance represented by the tile color may affect the outcome.",1,ad,True
"While RQ1 concerns user performance, RQ2 concerns user behavior. For example, we can hypothesize that, if the displayed aspects match well with the user's desired aspects, then the user can locate desired information without reformulating his query many times. Another possible hypothesis would be that, since AspecTiles enables the user to skip documents that are seemingly irrelevant to the desired aspects while scanning the ranked list, it may guide the user to documents that lie deeper in the ranked list.",0,,False

"Information visualization takes advantage of the user's visual information processing abilities by generating graphical representations of data or concepts for presenting textual information [21], and is known to be useful for quantitative comparisons [15]. Thus, many search result visualization methods have been proposed to provide the user with a quick overview of the retrieved documents.",1,ad,True
"According to Turetken and Sharda [20], web documents can be visualized based on content (e.g., title and term frequency) [4, 9, 10, 14, 16, 23], connectivity (e.g., number of incoming and outgoing links), and others (e.g., metadata like document size and the web domain) [4, 10]. Our AspecTiles falls into the first category, as it visualizes the relevance of each retrieved web page with respect to each displayed aspect.",1,ad,True
"The TileBar interface proposed by Hearst [9] and the simpler HotMap interface proposed by Hoeber and Yang [14] are visually somewhat similar to AspecTiles. In TileBar, each retrieved document is represented by a rectangle, where the query terms are arranged vertically and the document length is represented horizontally. For each query term, its term frequency within each section of a document is represented in grayscale. In HotMap, a row of squares are shown to the left of each retrieved document, where each square represents a particular query term and its withindocument term frequency. The user experiments by Hoeber and Yang suggested that HotMap is useful for effective and efficient information gathering. Our AspecTiles is different from TileBar and HotMap in that (a) the row of squares (which we call tiles2) represent possible aspects or intents of the query rather than the individual query terms of that query; and (b) the color of each tile represents the degree of relevance of the document to that particular aspect rather than term frequency. Thus, AspecTiles requires the backend search engine to provide a set of possible aspects given a query, and estimated per-aspect relevance scores. To our knowledge, our work is the first to study this kind of interface for the purpose of presenting diversified search results.",0,,False
"There are other ways to visualize search engine results, such as glyph-based and graph-based methods. Glyph-based approaches include the work by Heimonen and Jhaveri [10] who used documentshaped icons, and the work by Chau [4] who used a flower metaphor for representing statistics such as term frequency and document length. Graph-based approaches include bar charts of Reiterer et al. [16], and the radar charts of Yamamoto and Tanaka [23]. The radar charts were used for visualizing a fixed set of credibility criteria (accuracy, objectivity, authority, currency, and coverage). None of these studies was to do with multiple intents/aspects and search result diversification.",1,ad,True
"Brandt et al. [2] describe a method for dynamically presenting diversified search results. The main idea is to present a tree of web pages and dynamically recomputing it based on the nodes expanded by the user instead of showing a flat static list. While this rich presentation approach may have benefits, it is radically different from the standard SERP, and may be difficult to prevail. Moreover, its usability (e.g. the cognitive load of making the user backtrack within a tree, that of rearranging documents that the user has seen or has yet to see, etc.) is unknown. In contrast, AspecTiles lets the user go through a list just like traditional SERP, and is arguably easier for existing web search engines to adopt.",1,ad,True
"Our choice of using simple tiles (i.e. colored squares) for representing per-aspect relevance of retrieved documents is based on findings from previous research in user interface studies including the aforementioned ones. In particular, the user evaluation of HotMap [14] suggested that the simple interface offers effective and efficient information access as well as high user satisfaction. While HotMap users may quickly skip documents that are nonrelevant to the query and locate relevant documents with high query term frequencies, AspecTiles users may quickly skip documents that are nonrelevant to the desired aspects of the query and even locate relevant documents that cover multiple desired aspects.

"Regarding the underlying search engine that SERP interfaces require, a number of effective search result diversification algorithms have been proposed recently [1, 8, 18]. Any of these algorithms could be used with our AspecTiles presentation interface, provided that an explicit set of aspects of the given query and per-aspect relevance scores for each retrieved document are available. In this study, we use as input the diversified web search system described by Dou et al. [8].

"We compared three prototype interfaces in our user experiments: AspecTiles with five tiles, AspecTiles with three tiles and a baseline interface with no tiles. The number of tiles refers to the initial setting ­ participants were allowed to change the number of displayed tiles during their search tasks, as we shall explain later. We initially displayed either five or three tiles because (a) too many tiles would mean a wide left margin for the SERP and therefore waste of space; and (b) showing too much information may have adverse effects on the user performance and satisfaction. Note, for example, that current web search engines typically show no more than eight query suggestions at a time.",1,ad,True
"Figures 1, 2 and 3 show screenshots of our three interfaces for the query ""elliptical trainer."" All interfaces show the title, snippet and URL of each ranked document. In addition, the two AspecTiles interfaces show (a) aspect labels (e.g. ""reviews"", ""best machines"",",1,ad,True
"exercise etc.) at the top of SERP; (b) a colored tile for each displayed aspect, whose color represents the per-aspect relevance of the document in five-point scale (dark blue means highly relevant and light blue means marginally relevant); and (c) a popup text when the mouse is placed over a tile, which reminds the user of the aspect label. In addition, the user can freely adjust the number of displayed aspects to any number between zero and eight during the experiment, by clicking the Add or the Remove button. For example, if a user of the three-tile AspecTiles interface finds that none of the displayed aspects is useful, he may choose to click Add to show more aspects, some of which may turn out be relevant to his needs. Whereas, the baseline interface is very similar to popular search engines such as Google and Bing.",1,ad,True
"The three experimental interfaces share the same underlying diversification algorithm. When a query is issued, its top 300 search results and query suggestions are obtained using Bing API3. In our study, we treated these query suggestions as the aspects to be displayed on the interface, as they are easy to obtain, reasonably accurate and were effective for search result diversification with Dou et al.'s algorithm [8] at the NTCIR-9 INTENT task [19]. To save space, the aforementioned aspect labels were obtained after removing all query terms from each query suggestion; whereas, the original query suggestion string was shown in the popup text (e.g. ""reviews"" for the former and ""elliptical trainer reviews"" for the latter). A more sophisticated method that is dedicated to finding accurate aspects (information types) for AspecTiles deserves to be explored, but this is beyond the scope of our study: we focus on the usefulness of AspecTiles in a realistic situation where the displayed aspects do not perfectly overlap with the desired aspects.",1,AP,True
"Using the aspects thus obtained, we used the algorithm by Dou et al. to compute per-aspect relevance scores and to rerank the SERP obtained by Bing API. Our future plan includes letting the user click the tiles (as well as the aspect labels) on the AspecTiles interface and thereby dynamically rerank documents, but this is beyond the scope of the present study. Our current focus is to examine the effect of showing the tiles to the user rather than that of interacting with the tiles as well as with the aspect labels (query suggestions).",1,AP,True

"As we hypothesized that AspecTiles may be more useful for multi-aspect tasks (e.g. Find product names, benefits and reviews of the elliptical trainer) than for single-aspect tasks (e.g. What are the benefits of an elliptical trainer?), we devised 15 multi-aspect tasks and 15 single-aspect tasks shown in Table 1. For this purpose, we carefully examined the TREC 2009 web diversity task topics and selected 15 faceted (i.e. underspecified) topics that had informational subtopics [6], so that each selected topic could be used as a resource for creating exactly one multi-aspect task and exactly one single-aspect task 4. Figure 4 shows a selected topic: it contains a query field, a description field and several informational subtopics. From this topic, we created a multi-aspect task: ""Find information about elliptical trainer machines. (reviews, benefits, product names)."" The words in parenthesis correspond to the desired aspects, i.e., the types of information that the participants are asked to collect. In this example, these desired aspects correspond to informational subtopics 1, 3 and 4: for every multi-aspect task, we selected exactly three desired aspects. When more than three informational subtopics were available, we carefully selected three desired aspects from them so that the overlap between the selected aspects and the displayed aspects (i.e. query suggestions) are neither too high nor too low. As we mentioned earlier, we wanted to examine the realistic situation where the displayed aspects are of reasonable accuracy. In fact, the average number of informational subtopics per faceted topic was 3.8, so we used up most of the informational subtopics in the faceted topics. On the other hand, from the same topic, we created one single-aspect task: ""What are the benefits of an elliptical trainer compared to other fitness machines?"" Note that this is exactly subtopic 3. In summary, we prepared 15 multi-aspect tasks that require participants to look for exactly three aspects (e.g. reviews, benefits and product names), and 15 single-aspect tasks that require them to look for exactly one aspect (e.g. benefits).",1,TREC,True

For the elliptical trainer example, the short explanation indicated that it is a kind of stationary exercise machine (description obtained from Wikipedia) and a sample picture of an elliptical trainer was shown to the participants as additional information.

When the participant clicked on a URL within the interface, a special landing page window popped up, from which he could extract arbitrary part of the HTML by a mouse drag and bookmark it. A single bookmark can contain multiple text segments from the same webpage, as well as images and links. A single relevant bookmark may contain one or multiple answers, and may even cover multiple desired aspects. For example, one bookmark may contain a product name of elliptical trainer, its review as well as its picture.

The latter two statistics in particular show that even the three-tile AspecTiles is advantageous over the baseline. Thus, we can conclude that, for multi-aspect tasks, AspecTiles lets the user collect relevant pieces of information in shorter time using fewer clicks than the baseline, while keeping the user effectiveness at least comparable.

4.1.3 Effect of Quality of Displayed Aspects and Relevance Estimation Accuracy,0,,False
"AspecTiles requires as input (a) a set of aspects to be displayed in response to a query; and (b) per-aspect relevance score for each retrieved document. In this study, we chose to use query suggestions for (a), and a state-of-the-art diversified web search system [8] for (b), so that we can study the advantages of AspecTiles in a practical situation. Thus, in our study, both the quality of the displayed aspects and the estimated per-aspect relevance score (shown as colors of the tiles) are far from perfect. In this section, we investigate their effects on user effectiveness.",1,ad,True
"To investigate the effect of displayed aspect quality on user effectiveness, we computed precision, recall and (for multi-aspect tasks only) aspect coverage of the bookmarks at the query level rather than the task session level as was done in Section 4.1.2. This is because participants can issue multiple queries during a task session, and the displayed aspects (and therefore their quality) change accordingly within the task session. For each issued query, let n be the number of relevant bookmarks found by a particular user for that query. Then per-query precision is n divided by the number of bookmarks found by that user for that query, per-query recall is n divided by the total number of known relevant bookmarks for that query. We also compute per-query aspect coverage, i.e. the fraction of desired aspects covered by the user's bookmarks for that query. The quality of each set of displayed aspects was computed automatically: if a displayed aspect had at least one overlapping word with the task sentence, it was regarded as relevant; the qual-",1,ad,True

"On the other hand, to investigate the effect of relevance estimation accuracy, we computed precision, recall and (for multi-aspect tasks only) aspect coverage of the bookmarks for every clicked document. This is because the quality of estimated per-aspect relevance score for each clicked document change accordingly within the task session. For each clicked document, let n be the number of relevant bookmarks found by a particular user on that document. Then perdocument precision is n divided by the number of bookmarks found by that user within a particular document, per-document recall is n divided by the total number of known relevant bookmarks within that document. We also compute per-document aspect coverage, i.e. the fraction of desired aspects covered by the user's bookmarks within that document. For example, if two bookmarks were saved from a clicked document and only one of them was relevant, the precision for this document is 0.5. For computing these metrics, the first author of this paper manually examined all 1,483 clicked documents obtained in our experiments, and identified false alarms: a false alarm is a document-aspect pair that AspectTiles presented as relevant even though in fact the document content suggested otherwise. (Whereas, she did not check for misses: relevant documentaspect pairs which AspecTiles failed to present as relevant.)",0,,False
"Tables 4 and 5 show the Spearman's rank correlation values between user effectiveness and the aspect quality / relevance estimation accuracy with the strict and lenient sets, respectively. Recall that the user effectiveness values were computed per query for the displayed aspect quality and per document for the relevance estimation accuracy. It can be observed that user effectiveness (precision, recall and aspect coverage) is indeed correlated with the quality of displayed aspects and with the accuracy of estimated per-aspect relevance scores. The correlation is especially high for the latter. These results suggest that AspecTiles would be even more effective if the underlying search system can provide more appropriate selection of aspects to be displayed, as well as accurate per-aspect relevance scores. Note that showing innacurate relevance scores (in the form of colors) may seriously mislead the user: if the system fails to indicate that a document is relevant from a certain aspect, the user may skip the document; conversely, if the system shows a false positive for a certain aspect, the user may be forced to visit a document that is not useful to him.",1,ad,True

"Table 6 summarizes the number of query reformulations, the average query lengths (including the initial query and the queries reformulated by the participants), the average rank of clicked documents (""Rank-All""), the average rank of clicked documents that contain at least one relevant bookmark in the strict set (""Rank-Rel (strict)""), and the average rank of clicked documents that contain at least one relevant bookmark in the lenient set (""Rank-Rel (lenient)""). As before, for both task types (single-aspect and multiaspect), we conducted a two-factor (interface and task) ANOVA at p  0.05 for all types of measurements. For multi-aspect tasks, the interface effect was significant for all measures; for singleaspect tasks, none of the effects was significant. We thus conducted a Bonferroni post-hoc test at p  0.05 between two interfaces for multi-aspect tasks; significant differences with the baseline are shown in bold. It can be observed that, when the participants used AspecTiles for multi-aspect tasks, they performed significantly fewer query reformulations, issued shorter queries, and clicked documents that are deeper in the ranked list, compared to the baseline interface. Though not statistically significant, similar trends can be observed for single-aspect tasks, except for the query length. We also examined other measurements such as the number of clicked documents and the time to complete the task session, but did not find any clear trends.",1,hoc,True
"The above significant differences between AspecTiles and the baseline interface are quite intuitive. With AspecTiles, users perform fewer query reformulations probably because the displayed aspects serve as an alternative to forming new queries. For example, if the displayed aspects represent more specific information needs than the current query, then the user may not have to add a new query term to the current query to explicitly specialize his need. This is also reflected in the significant differences in the average query length. Moreover, with AspecTiles, users dig deeper in the ranked lists, probably because AspecTiles lets the user quickly skip documents that appear to be irrelevant to the desired aspects. That is, provided that the choice of displayed aspects and the peraspect relevance shown in colors are both sufficiently accurate, AspecTiles may be able to let the user reach the desired documents efficiently. Moreover, note that five-tile AspecTiles outperforms three-tile AspecTiles in all of these measurements, though the differences are not statistically significant.",1,ad,True

"Figure 6 confirms some of our aforementioned findings more qualitatively, and offers some additional insights into user behavior. For example, by comparing the rows of five-tile AspecTiles with those of the baseline, it can be observed not only that the latter contains more query reformulation operations (Q's), but that participants often reformulated queries at the very beginning of the search interactions with the baseline interface (See lines (1) and (4)). With the baseline interface, the number of sessions beginning with an immediate query reformulation was 17 for single-aspect tasks and 12 for multi-aspect tasks; in contrast, with five-tile AspecTiles, the same statistic was 8 for single-aspect tasks and 4 for multi-aspect tasks. Moreover, it can be observed that the number of clicked documents before finding the first relevant bookmark (D's to the left of the first square with a number) tends to be smaller with AspecTiles, which is again in line with our quantitative results. Furthermore, it can be observed that, with AspecTiles, participants tend to find a larger number of relevant bookmarks and relevant aspects, although these trends were not statistically significant in our quantitative results.",1,ad,True
"Next, we discuss typical usage patterns of AspecTiles, which we have observed physically during the user experiments and also from the operation logs that we analyzed postmortem. An AspecTile user typically begins a session by checking the aspect labels of the initial search result. If the displayed aspects seem appropriate, he utilizes the tiles, i.e. place a mouse over a tile and see the aspect label as a popup text, and clicks the document. In Figure 6, this can",0,,False

"be seen as a repetition of P's and D's (See lines (2), (3) and (6)). On the other hand, if the displayed aspects look unsatisfactory, the user often increases tiles and reformulate queries, as represented by T's and Q's in the figure (See lines (5) and (8)). For example, line (8) represents a multi-aspect task for ""I'm looking for information on Rick Warren, the evangelical minister. (biography, articles, books),"" where the initially displayed aspect labels were ""controversy, obama, sermons."" As the user judged that these displayed aspects did not directly match the three desired aspects, he immediately increased the number of displayed aspects (two T's at the beginning of the session). Again, this example suggests that the quality of the displayed aspects is important. Moreover, Figure 6 line (3) contains many nonrelevant bookmarks (N's), and this was because the document clicked by the user had a high estimated relevance to the aspect ""(atari) classic games"" even though it in fact discussed many other types of games besides Atari. Thus the user was misled by the color displayed by AspecTiles. Again, this highlights the importance of providing accurate relevance per-aspect estimates to the user.",1,ad,True
"As an additional and inconclusive remark, it appeared that while participants with high computer skills (e.g. researchers) tended to actively reformulate queries without referring to the tiles, those with relatively lower computer skills tended to rely on the tiles.

Our main findings are:",1,TREC,True
"· In multi-aspect tasks, participants were significantly more efficient with AspecTiles than with the baseline interface, in terms of time to find the first relevant bookmark, number of documents clicked before finding the first relevant bookmark, the average time between finding two relevant bookmarks, and the average number of document clicks between finding two relevant bookmarks. On the other hand, the search effectiveness with AspecTiles was at least as high as that with the baseline: in fact, the five-tile AspecTiles significantly outperformed the baseline in terms of recall as well.",0,,False

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Result diversification deals with ambiguous or multi-faceted queries by providing documents that cover as many subtopics of a query as possible. Various approaches to subtopic modeling have been proposed. Subtopics have been extracted internally, e.g., from retrieved documents, and externally, e.g., from Web resources such as query logs. Internally modeled subtopics are often implicitly represented, e.g., as latent topics, while externally modeled subtopics are often explicitly represented, e.g., as reformulated queries.",0,,False
"We propose a framework that: i) combines both implicitly and explicitly represented subtopics; and ii) allows flexible combination of multiple external resources in a transparent and unified manner. Specifically, we use a random walk based approach to estimate the similarities of the explicit subtopics mined from a number of heterogeneous resources: click logs, anchor text, and web n-grams. We then use these similarities to regularize the latent topics extracted from the top-ranked documents, i.e., the internal (implicit) subtopics. Empirical results show that regularization with explicit subtopics extracted from the right resource leads to improved diversification results, indicating that the proposed regularization with (explicit) external resources forms better (implicit) topic models. Click logs and anchor text are shown to be more effective resources than web n-grams under current experimental settings. Combining resources does not always lead to better results, but achieves a robust performance. This robustness is important for two reasons: it cannot be predicted which resources will be most effective for a given query, and it is not yet known how to reliably determine the optimal model parameters for building implicit topic models.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"Queries in Web search are often short and underspecified [2]. For example, the query ""python"" may refer to a snake as well as a programming language, while the programming language ""python"" covers a wide range of subtopics, such as tutorials, documentations, and downloads. Without knowing the users' actual intent, result diversification deals with such queries by providing documents that cover as many subtopics of a query as possible, so that the average user's ""unhappiness"" is minimized [43].",1,ad,True
"Result diversification has been intensively studied and many diversification algorithms have been proposed [1, 7, 8, 21, 34, 35, 43]. This paper focuses on the discovery of subtopics, also referred to as query intent, facets, and sub-queries in the literature. Subtopics have been extracted internally, e.g., from documents retrieved in response to the query [7, 8, 26, 29], and externally, e.g., from Web resources such as query logs [1, 20, 21, 33, 35]. Internally modelled subtopics are often implicitly represented, e.g., as latent topics or document clusters, while externally modelled subtopics are often explicitly represented, e.g., as reformulated queries1. In particular, there has been much work that exploits explicit subtopics using various types of Web resources. Some take suggested queries from commercial search engines as subtopics of a query [35]; others mine the subtopics from resources such as taxonomies [1, 22], query logs[21, 33], anchor text and Web ngrams [20].",0,,False
"While both implicit and explicit subtopics extracted from various Web resources have shown their effectiveness in helping retrieving diverse search results, both topic representations have their limitations. Often, the process of extracting subtopics for a query in a Web resource is focused on finding the subtopics that are relevant to the query, while the relation among the extracted subtopics are not well preserved. For instance, all subtopics discovered in Web resources, e.g., all reformulations of a query, are treated as independent subtopics, regardless the fact that some may be synonymous [21, 35]. In some studies additional steps such as clustering were taken in order to avoid redundancy and find better defined topics [20, 33]. On the other hand, implicitly represented subtopics such as topic models or clusters constructed from document content convey much information about the relations or the structure of the topics present in the documents. Yet, in this case the infor-",1,ad,True
"1 Notice that in the context of result diversification, ""implicit"" sometimes refers to diversification methods such as MMR where no actual topics are modeled and only document similarities are used. In this paper, from a topic modeling perspective, we refer to topic models/clusters as implicit topic representations, since no ""labels"" that indicate the content of the topics are assigned, and refer to subtopics represented with external entities such as query suggestions, anchor text, as explicit topic representations, as such entities present the content of the topic explicitly [25].",0,,False

· Can we make use of the information from both implicitly and explicitly represented subtopics?,0,,False
"Various resources were shown to provide useful information in subtopic mining, sometimes complementary to each other. Click logs have for example been shown an effective resource for subtopic mining in a number of studies [21, 33], but their availability are mainly limited to commercial web engines. Anchor text has been suggested a good proxy for query information, but it is not clear if one should be preferred over the other. Web ngrams are freely available, but may not provide as high quality subtopics for a query as click logs, partially because of the noise introduced by phrases not relevant to the topic of interest. Given a variety of resources, we are interested in a second question:",0,,False
· Can we combine multiple external sources to help subtopic modeling?,0,,False
"We seek a principled way to model the subtopics of a query using multiple sources, including implicitly represented topics extracted from document content, as well as explicitly represented subtopics mined from various Web resources. While combining subtopics from multiple sources can be useful, it is non-trivial. Different resources provide evidence that a subtopic is relevant to a query from different perspectives, which leads to different types of measurements to quantify the similarity between subtopics. We propose a graph based approach to combine explicit subtopics from Web resources. More specifically, we construct local graphs over the subtopics extracted from each single resource. The local graphs are interconnected through subtopics that appear in multiple resources. A measure of subtopic similarity within each local graph is converted into random walk transition probabilities, to obtain a probabilistic framework. Subtopics from different sources are combined in a random walk over the resulting graph, that integrates the various external resources. The result of the random walk defines a probability distribution that encodes the similarity between all subtopics from all resources included in the graph. Given the similarities in the explicit subtopic graphs, we exploit these similarities for regularization during the construction of implicitly defined subtopics from the search result list. Using regularized topic models, the similarities among the explicit subtopics serve as additional constraints, that need to be satisfied when constructing implicit subtopics using document content.",1,ad,True
"Our contribution is two-fold. First, we propose a framework that: i) combines both implicitly and explicitly represented subtopics in a principled way; and ii) allows flexible combination of multiple external resources, in a transparent and unified manner. With respect to the proposed framework, an in-depth investigation on its effectiveness as well as limitations are provided. Second, using this framework, we compare the usefulness of various resources (and their combinations) for identifying diversification subtopics. Our findings provide additional evidence for findings in earlier studies on similar themes, and lay a foundation for future work on selecting useful resources for topic modeling.",1,ad,True

In Section 2, we discuss the related work on subtopic modeling in result diversification, as well as work related to the techniques employed in this paper.

2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
"Search result diversification has a long history [5, 7, 10, 23, 37, 43] and a range of diversification approaches have been proposed previously. Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) [7], an early representative diversification method, aims to balance the relevance and diversity of a ranked list. A probabilistic version of MMR has been proposed by Zhai et al. [43], as part of their risk minimization framework. Zhu et al. [44] proposed a ranking method based on random walks in an absorbing Markov chain. By turning ranked items into absorbing states, the method prevents redundant items from receiving a high rank. Yue and Joachims [42] studied a learning algorithm based on a structural Support Vector Machine (SVM) that identifies diverse subsets in a set of documents. Carterette and Chandar [8] proposed a probabilistic model for faceted retrieval, where the facets of a query are modeled with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [4], one of the state-of-the-art topic modeling approaches. In most of these studies, the focus has been on the development of ranking algorithms to produce ranked lists that convey both relevant and diverse information about a query. Only limited effort has been made in mining high quality subtopics for a query, and subtopics were usually modeled based on document content.",1,ad,True
"Recently however, in the context of Web retrieval, a renewed interest in result diversification has emerged. Representative approaches include Intent Aware select (IA-select) [1] and explicit query aspect diversification (xQuAD) [35]. Common to these approaches is the importance of modeling both the subtopics of a query and the relevance of a document with respect to the subtopics of a query. Both works exploited Web resources for subtopic mining. In [1], categories in the Open Directory Project (ODP) taxonomy were used as candidate subtopics, and in [35], query suggestions from Web search engines were used as related subtopics of a query. Recently, Dou et al. [21] has first proposed to combine subtopics mined from multiple sources, including query logs, anchor text, document clusters, and web sites of search results. A common assumption among studies where Web resources are used for subtopic extraction is that the extracted subtopics would be independent. However, these assumptions are most likely not true. Anchor text has for instance been shown to be an effective substitute for query logs in generating query reformulations [19], which indicates that these two resources should be correlated. Moreover, within a single resource such as query logs, various reformulations of a query may be synonyms that refer to the same concept. Our approach does not require to assume the independence among mined subtopics. Conversely, we focus on modeling specifically the similarity or relatedness among the subtopics. In our experiments, we employ IA-select as the primary diversification method (see Section 5.3), to indirectly evaluate the effectiveness of using our approach to model subtopics from multiple sources.",1,ODP,True
"A closely related line of research focuses on mining subtopics of a query from various Web resources. Radlinski et al. [33] infer query aspects from query logs, using clicks and session information to model the relations between queries. Dang et al. [20] infer query intent from anchor text and Web ngrams. In both studies, clustering has been applied to the extracted aspects or intents, so that topically redundant or similar entities (queries, anchor text, or Web ngrams) are grouped together. In this paper, we use the same types of Web resources for subtopic mining, and compare their effectiveness in the context of result diversification; although in terms of a query",1,ad,True

Instead of applying clustering, we incorporate the obtained similarities between the extracted subtopics into the topic models constructed using document content. This way we incorporate the similarity between extracted subtopics into the similarity between documents.",1,ad,True
"To compute the similarity between subtopics extracted from different Web resource, we construct graphs over these subtopics and compute their associations using Markov random walks. Similar approaches have been studied in a wide range of topic in the context of query log analysis. For example, Craswell and Szummer [16] studied the usage of Markov random walks over the bipartite graph constructed from click logs for document ranking. Fuxman et al. [22] developed a random walk algorithm for keyword generation from query click graphs. This approach was also adopted in [1] to extract subtopics related to a query from the ODP taxonomy. Ma et al. [30] proposed a query suggestion approach based on Markov random walk and hitting time on the query-URL bipartite graph, aimed at suggesting both semantically relevant and diverse queries to Web users. A recent work that is closely related to ours is the Multi-view random walk (MVR) approach proposed by Cui et al. [18], which aims to combine knowledge from different views of an object in a random walk process. We discuss the differences between their work and ours in detail in Section 3.",1,ad,True
"To balance graph-based and textual similarity between documents, we use regularized topic models [6, 24]. A similar approach was taken in Guo et al. [24], where queries were enriched with document snippets to improve a query similarity model; we however enrich the document content with queries to construct a document similarity model.",0,,False

"We now detail how we use a Markov random walk based approach to compute the relations between the explicit subtopics of a query in different types of resources. Let R , {ri}Ni,1 be a resource that contains N subtopics related to a query q. Consider for instance a query log that contains N reformulations of q. For a set of resources R ,"" {Rg}, we construct a network consisting of subgraphs on multiple parallel `planes', as shown in Figure 1. First, for each Rg, we construct a weighted graph Gg "","" {Eg; Rg}, where the nodes Rg corresponding to the subtopics in resource g lie on a single plane, and the edges Eg are weighted by the similarity w(ri, rj) between the two nodes. For now, we abstract from the specific way the similarity is defined within a plane, aiming for a method that can be applied generically; details of the graphs created for specific resources are deferred to Section 4. In the second step, we interconnect nodes from different planes Ga and Gb with an extra set of edges, where each edge connects the nodes ri  Ga, rj  Gb that we consider equivalent. Throughout this paper, we consider ri and rj equivalent whenever they have exact matching text representations. While it would be interesting to include non-exact matches, we leave this for future investigation.""",0,,False
"For each resource considered, the similarity scores computed may encode different semantics, such that they may not be compared directly across different planes. This is the primary reason why we are not in favor of constructing a single graph that mixes up subtopics from different resources. To resolve this problem, we first transform the similarity scores into 1-step random walk transition probabilities. The only assumption behind the resulting transition probability is that the chance to travel from one subtopic to",0,,False

Further, the random walk sums up the transition probability of all paths of length t between two nodes. The transition probability will be high if there exist many paths from one node to the other. The higher the transition probability the more similar or closely related the two nodes are. During the random walk, the underlying clustering structure of the nodes emerges [36]. If such a clustering structure exists among the nodes, with longer walks, the probability between nodes within a cluster converges to a value higher than that with any node outside the cluster [16]. The probability distribution that arises can therefore be interpreted as a similarity measure that captures the relations between the subtopics in our graphs.",0,,False

Not requiring such a correspondence allows for a greater diversity of resources used. Also, MVR defines a 1-step cross-view transition only between corresponding nodes. In principle, although we have not yet studied this alternative setting, our representation allows to consider also a between-plane 1-step transition from a node in one plane to multiple nodes in the other plane, i.e., setting the p1 (j|i) with non-zero values to each pair of nodes i and j.",0,,False

The advantage of using local graphs is two-fold: i) it is computationally efficient, and ii) queries that are not relevant to the original query are effectively pruned. In order to collect related subtopics for a query q, we find the queries that share co-clicked documents with q, and for each of these queries further find its coclicked queries.

"We now discuss the experimental results and their indications to the answers to our research questions. In the following discussion, we will first discuss the behavior of LapPLSA regularized by subtopics from different types of external resources in terms of the general trends shown by the results. We then zoom in to a few specific settings of K and examine the effectiveness of the proposed framework, e.g., highlighting the significance of the observed differences between approaches. Although the number of topics K is an important parameter that has an impact on the diversification result, we do not attempt to optimize it. We do investigate the sensitivity of our results to the estimation of K, when discussing RQ4.",0,,False
6.1 Single resources,0,,False
"We start with the performance of LapPLSA using single resources. Figure 3 shows the result of IA-select using topic models constructed with the following methods: pLSA without regularization and LapPLSA regularized by similarity matrices generated using click logs, anchor text, and Web ngrams, i.e., LapPLSA_C, LapPLSA_A, and LapPLSA_N, respectively. ""Baseline"" refers to the run without diversification.",0,,False
"First, we see that both pLSA and LapPLSA (with different resources) can outperform the baseline. Compared to pLSA, LapPLSA shows more robust performance: diversification with pLSA can underperform the baseline given an improperly set K, while diversification with LapPLSA regularized by the subtopics from an external resource in general outperforms the baseline irrespective of the choice of K. The only exception is the case where K ,"" 2, which is presumably not a sensible choice for K.""",0,,False
"Second, judging from Figure 3, the effectiveness of each resource differs on different topic sets. It is noticeable that on topic set 1-50, click logs remarkably outperform the other two resources across all settings of K. A possible explanation is that this topic set is derived from query logs of commercial search engines [12], and therefore the click logs have a relatively high coverage and turn out to be an effective resource for these topics. On topic set 51-100, click logs and anchor text show comparable performance, while Web ngrams are occasionally effective (given a specific settings of K). On topic set 101-150, anchor text generally outperforms click logs. This may due to the fact that the click logs have a very low (< 50%) coverage on this topic set, and that the topic set is rather recent (created in 2011) while the click logs were created in 2006, which may lead to further sparseness: e.g., on average, GA has 17.1 nodes per query, while GC only has 7.6 nodes per query on this topic set. In general, click logs and anchor text seem to be more valuable resources for regularization compared to Web ngrams, across different settings of K. Notice that the Web ngrams are primarily derived from document content, so perhaps their lower effectiveness can be explained by lower influence on pLSA, which also uses document content. To some extent, we can consider the Web ngrams more similar to the document content than click logs and anchor text.",1,ad,True
"As expected, the diversification results of IA-select based on both pLSA and on LapPLSA are sensitive to the change of the parameter K. In particular, there is no clear correlation between the number of clusters and the end-to-end diversification performance, which further suggests the difficulty of finding an optimal K (that would fit for a set of queries). For more detailed analysis on the parameter K, see Section 6.4.",0,,False
6.2 Combining multiple resources,0,,False
"Figure 4(a)-4(c) show the result of combining subtopics from the two relatively more effective resources, namely click logs(GC ) and anchor text (GA). While we only show the combination of these two resources, a similar trend can be observed in the other combinations. We see that combining resources does not always lead to improved diversification results over that of the single resources. Such improvement only happens in a few cases where K is likely to be in an optimal setting for the combined resource GCA, i.e., K , 10 in Figure 4(b) and K ,"" 6 in Figure 4(c). In general, the combination of different resources leads to an """"averaged"""" performance compared to the individual resources that are combined.""",1,ad,True
"This observation is reasonable. Intuitively, combining resources on the one hand increases the coverage of subtopics, e.g., as shown in Table 3, but on the other hand may introduce noise, e.g., if one of the resources contains low quality subtopics. Recall that when constructing the local graphs, their nodes (i.e., subtopics) were selected based on their relation to the original query. In this stage, the relevance of the nodes with respect to the original query was taken into account. However, when combining resources, i.e., during the random walk stage, the goal was to measure the similarities among nodes across resources and no further pruning was conducted. That is, all entries in different graphs were assumed to be equally good. Given our observations on the combined result, a natural step for future work would prune further to prevent low quality resources from deteriorating high quality resources.",0,,False
6.3 Zoom in on specific settings of K,0,,False
"Now, let us zoom in to the performance of diversification under specific settings of K. Specifically, we aim to examine the answers to the following questions: 1) are the differences between the diversified result and the baseline significant? and 2) are the differences between the LapPLSA regularized by subtopics from different external resources and the non regularized pLSA significant? For the first question, we consider the setting when K is set to the optimal value for a given topic set. For the second question, since both pLSA and LapPLSA are sensitive to K, we set K to the optimal value for each query, so that the impact of K is reduced to the minimum. Note that here by saying ""optimal"", we mean the best K in the range of [2, 10] in terms of -nDCG@20.",0,,False
"Table 4 and Table 5 show the results with respect to the first and the second questions, respectively.",0,,False
"From Table 4 we see that with a proper setting of K, in most cases, diversification with pLSA as well as with LapPLSA significantly outperforms the baseline. Again, the effectiveness of each individual resource differs for the three topic sets. For topics 1-50, regularization with click logs is most effective, while regularization with anchor text and with Web ngrams fails to have significant improvement over the baseline. On topic set 51-100, while pLSA based diversification does not result in significant improvement over the baseline in terms of both ERR-IA@20 and -nDCG@20, all LapPLSA based runs show significant improvement in terms of at least one of the two measures. On topic set 101150, only the run with LapPLSA using click logs does not achieve significant improvement over the baseline, all others do.",0,,False
"Table 5 shows that LapPLSA regularized with subtopics from external resources does not always lead to significant improvement over pLSA. However, on each of the three topic sets, at least one resource exists that, when used for regularization, outperforms pLSA significantly. Again, regularization with click logs is shown to be most effective, on topic set 1-50. On topic set 51-100, except click logs, regularization with one of the resources or their combinations results in significant improvement over the non-regularized pLSA.",1,ad,True

"We proposed Multi-source Subtopics (MSS), a framework for subtopic modeling that i) uses a random walk based approach to combine and estimate the similarity between subtopics extracted from multiple Web sources, and ii) uses the obtained similarity relations to regularize topic models constructed using document content. MSS combines subtopics from multiple resources transparently, unifying implicit and explicit representations of subtopics.",0,,False
"We have demonstrated how the application of this framework in the context of search result diversification allows us to flexibly combine, analyze and compare subtopics extracted from different resources. Empirical results show that topic models regularized by the topical information extracted from external resources lead to improved and more robust diversification results, supporting our claim that better topic models are formed. Among the Web resources employed in our experiments, anchor text and click logs were shown to be generally more effective than Web ngrams. However, the effectiveness of a resource also depends on the properties of a specific query, and especially whether a resource contains subtopic information related to a query at all. Combining multiple resources could alleviate lack of coverage, but in our current setup leads to a diversification performance in between that of the resources that are combined.",1,ad,True
"A number of directions are left to be explored in the future. First of all, there is room to improve our method by exploring how to weigh resources by their (expected) quality for a given query. More resources can be analyzed, for example derived from social bookmarking sites, and more sophisticated ways of parameter optimization should be considered. Second, a component wise evaluation may improve our understanding beyond observations on the diversification pipeline as a whole. Hereto, we need to develop a method to evaluate the quality of the constructed subtopics directly through human assessment. This may be especially useful to improve our understanding of the features that make an external resource a good one for a given query. Finally, perhaps the strength of the external resources is not yet exploited in full when we only use them to regularize pLSA. An alternative could be to integrate implicit topics as nodes in the multi-plane random walks, and thus treat both types of topic representations more equally.",0,,False

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"There has been considerable interest in incorporating diversity in search results to account for redundancy and the space of possible user needs. Most work on this problem is based on subtopics: diversity rankers score documents against a set of hypothesized subtopics, and diversity rankings are evaluated by assigning a value to each ranked document based on the number of novel (and redundant) subtopics it is relevant to. This can be seen as modeling a user who is always interested in seeing more novel subtopics, with progressively decreasing interest in seeing the same subtopic multiple times. We put this model to test: if it is correct, then users, when given a choice, should prefer to see a document that has more value to the evaluation. We formulate some specific hypotheses from this model and test them with actual users in a novel preference-based design in which users express a preference for document A or document B given document C. We argue that while the user study shows the subtopic model is good, there are many other factors apart from novelty and redundancy that may be influencing user preferences. From this, we introduce a new framework to construct an ideal diversity ranking using only preference judgments, with no explicit subtopic judgments whatsoever.",1,corpora,True

"Research on novelty and diversity aims to improve the effectiveness of search engines by providing results that serve a range of possible user intents for the given query.

"eral important purposes: first, giving developers and researchers a measurable objective; second, allowing for failure analysis and troubleshooting; and third, trying to estimate how useful search results will be to users. For the last of these, it is helpful to think of the evaluation measure and relevance judgments as a model of user utility. Measures like precision and recall can be seen as modeling utility in terms of the proportion of retrieved documents that are relevant and the proportion of relevant documents retrieved; measures like discounted cumulative gain or expected reciprocal rank offer a more refined model of user utility that incorporates graded judgments and rank-based discounts.",1,corpora,True
"None of these models capture novelty or redundancy in ranked results. All of them will reward a system for retrieving the same relevant document 10 times in a row, or 10 relevant documents that are only superficially different from each other; while that may be useful for knowing whether retrieval features are working correctly, it is not likely to be very useful to a user. Diversity evaluation attempts to model novelty and redundancy in ranked results so as to give a more precise model of user utility.",0,,False
"Current diversity evaluation measures in the literature require judgments of relevance to subtopics (also called aspects, facets, or nuggets) of a topic. For example, judgments for the query Windows would include binary relevance judgments for each document for the subtopics window panes, windows operating system, etc. These subtopic judgments are used to determine whether a document is redundant with a previously-ranked document, or whether it contains some new information that a user might find interesting, or whether it is relevant to an alternative intent and perhaps not useful to this user but still useful enough to a different user. Measures like -nDCG, ERR-IA, subtopic recall, and D-measures [?, ?, ?, ?] all use this same basic model, assigning more value to a document with more novel subtopics and less value to one with more redundant subtopics.",0,,False
"Like any model, the subtopic model surely has shortcomings. Novelty and redundancy are certainly not the only reasons a user might prefer one relevant document over another. Apart from a study by Sanderson et al. that showed that user preferences for rankings correlate with -nDCG [?], there has not been much work on validating this model against real user preferences. And if the model does not track user preferences, then it is hard to justify its continued use: it conflates various aspects of effectiveness in such a way that, if used as an objective function, it can be difficult to understand the precise effect of change in the ranker.",1,Novelty,True
861,0,,False
"Fortunately these measures produce directly-testable hypotheses about user preferences. In this work we describe a novel user study to test these hypotheses. In Section 2 we start by describing the diversity retrieval problem in more detail and define the model more precisely. In Section 3 we present a user study, including a crowdsourced design; we show that while the model is not perfect, it is certainly not invalid. Section 4 builds on this by presenting a preferencebased method for determining a diversity-aware ranking of documents. We conclude in Section 5.",0,,False
2. NOVELTY RANKING TASK,0,,False
"Consider a user that has an unambiguous but broad information need and goes to a search engine to help satisfy it. This user will input a query and then see a ranked list of results, some of which will be relevant and some of which will not. The user will presumably click the relevant results to view and absorb the information they contain. Ideally, each relevant result would provide some new information that was not provided by previous relevant results; in other words, the relevant results would not be redundant with each other. The idea is that, each time a user clicks on a new relevant document, the amount of knowledge a user gains must be maximized by the novel content in the document.",1,ad,True
"The goal of ranking documents with novelty is to ensure that each relevant document a user sees as they progress down a ranked list provides new, non-redundant information that will help them satisfy their need. This means that a ranking of documents cannot be based solely on the probability of relevance; the novelty of a document depends to no small degree on the documents that have been ranked above it. Similarly, evaluation of these results cannot be based solely on binary or even graded relevance judgments, since these judgments are made to individual documents independently of all the other documents that might have been ranked. Part of studying the task is defining evaluation measures that can model redundancy and novelty.",1,ad,True
2.1 Relationship With Other Tasks,0,,False
"The novelty task has similarities with some existing tasks such as the diversity task studied as part of the TREC Web track. Diversity aims at retrieving a subset of documents that has the maximum coverage of subtopics with the assumption that different users may be interested in different subtopics. In novelty ranking, the goal is to provide a set of documents for a single topic from which the user can get as much information as possible for that particular topic. We assume all users are interested in all of the subtopics, like the standard ad hoc assumption that all users are interested in all of the relevant material.",1,TREC,True
2.2 Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Diversity,0,,False
"Researchers in the past have identified two types of diversity: extrinsic and intrinsic [?]. Extrinsic diversity addresses the uncertainty in an ambiguous query where the intent is unclear and is best served by a ranking of documents covering several intents. Intrinsic diversity can be described as diversification that focuses on reducing redundancy and providing novel information for an unambiguous but still underspecified information need. In our work, we focus on intrinsic diversity which we refer to as novelty ranking, as we believe it will be easier for assessors to express preferences when there is no ambiguity of intent.",1,ad,True
2.3 Evaluation,0,,False
Evaluation measures for novelty and diversity must account for both relevance and novelty in the result set. It is important that redundancy caused by documents containing previously retrieved subtopics be penalized and documents containing novel information be rewarded. Most evaluation measures solve this problem by requiring that the subtopics for a query be known and that documents have been judged with respect to subtopics.,0,,False

The Newswire data includes relevance judgments for the top 130 documents retrieved by a query-likelihood language model for the short query for each query. The judgments consists of binary relevance judgments for each document, and for each relevant document, a list of subtopics contained in that document. This data reflects an intrinsic diversity task and is therefore most appropriate to this work.",1,TD,True
3. FACTORS INFLUENCING USER PREFERENCES,0,,False
"In Section 2.3.2, we identified some principles on which the evaluations for diversity are based on. In this section we tests if these principles hold for real users and further study in detail the role of subtopics in influencing user preference. Although in practice the same evaluation measures are used for both intrinsic and extrinsic diversity, our focus is on intrinsic diversity as it is easier for assessors to understand the concept of relevance when there is no ambiguity of intent. We explore the factors that influence user preference for novelty ranking using a preference based framework.",0,,False
3.1 Triplet Framework,0,,False
"The idea of pairwise preference judgments is relatively new in the IR literature, having been introduced by Rorvig in 1990 [?] but not subject to empirical study until the past several years [?, ?]. Comparison studies between absolute and preference judgments show that preference judgments can often be made faster than graded judgments, with better agreement between assessors (and more consistency with individual assessors) [?]. Also with preferences tassessors can make much finer distinctions between documents.",1,ad,True
"We propose a preference-based framework to study novelty consisting of a set up in which three relevant documents that we refer to as a triplet are displayed such that one of them appears at the top and the other two are displayed as a pair below the top document. We will use DT , DL, and DR to denote the top, left, and right documents respectively, and a triplet as DL, DR|DT . An assessor shown such a triplet would be asked to choose which of DL or DR they would prefer to see as the second document in a ranking given that DT is first, or in other words, they would express a preference for DL or DR conditional on DT . For the purpose of this study we will assume we have relevance judgments to a topic, and for each relevant document, binary judgments of relevance to a set of subtopics. Thus we can represent a document as the set of subtopics it has been judged relevant to, e.g. Di ,"" {Sj, Sk} means document i is relevant to subtopics j and k. Varying the number of subtopics in top, left and right documents yields specific hypotheses about preferences for novelty over redundancy.""",0,,False

"The triplet framework allows us to collect judgments for novelty based on preferences and also enables us to test various hypotheses. As discussed above, varying the number of subtopics in DT , DL and DR it is possible to enumerate various hypotheses concerning the effect of subtopics in a document. We define two types of hypotheses; one very specific with respect to subtopic counts and redundancy, and the other more general.",0,,False
"Hypothesis Set 1 : First we propose the simplest possible hypotheses that capture the three principles above. We will denote a preference between two documents using , e.g. DL DR means document DL is preferred to document DR. Then the three hypotheses stated formally are:",0,,False

"H3: if DL, DR|DT ,"" {S2, S3}, {S2}|{S1} , then DL DR (novelty+novelty is better than novelty alone)""",0,,False
Hypothesis Set 2 : Here we define a class of hypotheses in which the number of subtopics contained in each document in a triplet is categorized by relative quantity. We identify six variables based on number of subtopics that almost completely describe the novelty and redundancy present in the triplet. The six variable are as follows:,0,,False
1. T n - Number of subtopics in DT ; 2. N Ln - Number of subtopic in DL not present in DT ; 3. N Rn - Number of subtopic in DR not present in DT ; 4.

"The number of subtopics for each of the six variables are categorized as low or high. The six variables enable us to test the effect of novelty and redundancy w.r.t the number of subtopics in a triplet. The variables N Ln and N Rn focus on novelty whereas RLn and RRn focuses on redundancy. For instance, by varying N Ln and N Rn and holding the other variables constant, it is possible to test the effect of the relative quantity of novel subtopics in a document.",0,,False

3.3 Experimental Design,0,,False
"In this section we describe the experimental design used to test the hypotheses defined above. Notice that the defined hypotheses are based on the number of subtopics contained in the documents and they fit into the triplet framework which requires conditional preference judgments. Therefore, to test our hypotheses, two kinds of judgments were needed: subtopic level judgments and conditional preference judgments.

Six queries were used to test the first set of hypotheses with four triplets for each query.",0,,False

For H1, assessors preferred the shorter document in 79% of triplets. For H2, that decreased to 71% of triplets, and for H3 it dropped steeply to only 44%. However, it is also true that the mean difference in length for the pair of documents they were choosing between was greatest for H1 triplets and least for H3 triplets (H1:158 terms, H2:126 terms, H3:47 terms). Therefore its safe to conclude there seems to be a preference towards shorter documents.",0,,False
"Highlighted terms It turns out that assessors tended to prefer the document with fewer highlighted query terms. For H1, assessors preferred the document with more query terms only 35% of the time. For H2 that drops to 13%, and for H3 it comes back up to 29%. The mean difference in number of query term occurrences is quite low, only on the order of one additional occurrence on average for H1 and H3 documents, and only 0.2 additional occurrences for H2. While the effect is significant, it seems unlikely that assessors can pick up on such small differences. We think the effect is more likely due to the distribution of subtopics in documents.",1,ad,True
3.7 Additional Investigation,0,,False
"While the results suggest that the number of subtopics influences user preferences, it is also clear that from the analysis that other factors are affecting preferences. The results from H1 and the weaker preference in H2 were not what we expected.

None of this is surprising, but there is currently no evaluation paradigm of note that take all of these factors into account in a holistic way. Preference judgments can, and this analysis suggests additional hypotheses for testing with preferences.",1,ad,True
4. PREFERENCE JUDGMENTS FOR AN IDEAL NOVELTY RANKING,0,,False
"The user study shows that although users tend to prefer documents containing more novel subtopics, it is also evident that factors other than subtopics play a vital role. The study also shows that the presence of subtopic in a document is taken into account implicitly and preferences are based not only on the number of subtopics but also on several other factors that include subtopic importance, relevance of the subtopic, readability of the document, etc. In this section, we propose an approach that attempts to capture these factors implicitly using a preference based framework to form a full ranking of documents with novelty as an implicit quality.",1,ad,True

"The sequence continues by adding more documents to the top. For the third set, the comparison involves information in two previously ranked documents along with a pair of documents; for the fourth, it involves information in three previously ranked documents along with a pair.

We hypothesize that the first two sets of preferences (one for relevance and one for novelty) will provide a near-optimal approximation to the full set and if judgments are transitive (that is, if document A is preferred to B and B is preferred to C, then A should be preferred to C as well), the number of judgements needed can be reduced drastically.

This way the assessor only had to read one new document after each judgment, just as they would in normal singledocument assessing.

We showed that rankings obtained in this way correlate well to rankings based on subtopic judgments, and since assessors are highly self-consistent, probably capturing a great deal of other information as well. Of course, if subtopic judgments were replaced with preferences, we would need a new set of evaluation measures. This clearly is a direction for future work.",0,,False

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Crowdsourcing is a market of steadily-growing importance upon which both academia and industry increasingly rely. However, this market appears to be inherently infested with a significant share of malicious workers who try to maximise their profits through cheating or sloppiness. This serves to undermine the very merits crowdsourcing has come to represent. Based on previous experience as well as psychological insights, we propose the use of a game in order to attract and retain a larger share of reliable workers to frequentlyrequested crowdsourcing tasks such as relevance assessments and clustering. In a large-scale comparative study conducted using recent TREC data, we investigate the performance of traditional HIT designs and a game-based alternative that is able to achieve high quality at significantly lower pay rates, facing fewer malicious submissions.",1,ad,True

"number of scientific projects and is firmly integrated into numerous evaluation and data acquisition schemes in academia and industry. One problem, however, seems to be inherent to the field; a significant share of the annotations created on crowdsourcing platforms are fraudsters' attempts to cheat the HIT (Human Intelligence Task) provider into paying them without having properly worked on the HIT. As a consequence, almost every scientific publication that employs crowdsourcing for data acquisition details the authors' tailor-made defense scheme against cheaters and a rising number of publications is exclusively dedicated to the task of detecting these individuals. The range of commonlyobserved measures taken includes asking redundant questions to rely on an aggregate of several workers rather than the decisions of just one individual [33], using held-out data to compare with, asking plausibility questions and many more sophisticated methods [16, 13]. In many time-insensitive applications, HIT providers restrict the crowd of workers to certain nationalities (a typical example would be US workers only) who they trust will provide higher quality results. Although the approach is widely accepted and has been shown to significantly reduce the number of spam submissions, we believe that this uptake may be treating symptoms rather than the actual underlying cause. Rather than attributing the confirmed performance differences between the inhabitants of different countries to their nationality, we hypothesize that there are 2 major types of workers with fundamentally different motivations for offering their workforce on a crowdsourcing platform: (1) Money-driven workers are motivated by the financial reward that the HIT promises. (2) Entertainmentdriven workers primarily seek diversion but readily accept the financial incentives as an additional stimulus. We are convinced that the affiliation (or proximity) to one of those fundamental worker types can have a significant impact on the amount of attention paid to the task at hand, and, subsequently, on the resulting annotation quality. We realize, that money-driven workers are by no means bound to deliver bad quality; however, they appear to be frequently tempted into sloppiness by the prospect of a higher time efficiency and therefore stronger satisfaction of their main motivation. Entertainment-driven workers, on the other hand, appear to work a HIT more faithfully and thoroughly and regard the financial reward as a welcome bonus. They typically do not indulge in simple, repetitive or boring tasks. We propose to more strongly focus on entertainment-driven work-",1,ad,True

Csikszentmihalyi's theory of flow [12], a state of maximal immersion and concentration at which optimal intrinsic motivation, enjoyment and high task performance are achieved, further encouraged our design. We intend to increase the degree of satisfaction entertainmentdriven workers experience. This can lead to (a) higher result quality, (b) quicker batch processing rates, (c) lower overall cheater rates, (d) better cost efficiency. An additional incentive for delivering high-quality results in a game scenario would be the element of competition and social standing among players. Taking into account recent behavioural analyses of online communities and games [24], entertainment seekers can be expected to put considerable dedication into producing high-quality results to earn more points in a game to progress into higher difficulty levels or a rank on the high score leaderboard. The novel contributions of this work are 5-fold: (1) We describe a game-based approach to collecting document relevance assessments in both theory and design. (2) Based on NIST-created TREC data, we conduct a large-scale comparative evaluation to determine the merit of the proposed method over state-of-the-art relevance assessment crowdsourcing paradigms. (3) Venturing beyond ""hard"" quality indicators such as precision, cost-efficiency or annotation speed, we discuss a wide range of socio-economical factors such as demographics and alternative incentives to enhance a fundamental understanding of worker motivation. (4) In a separate study, we demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed game to other tasks on the example of noisy image classification. (5) We create a corpus of relevance assessments of considerable size and quality that we disclose to the research community. The remainder of this work is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the state of the art of crowdsourcing for document relevance assessments as well as in the domain of games with a purpose (GWAP). Section 3 introduces the theoretical considerations and design decisions that guide our annotation game. In Section 4, we describe the setup as well as the results of a large scale study conducted on several commercial crowdsourcing platforms in order to determine the usefulness of the proposed method. Section 5 demonstrates the generalizability of our method on the task of image classification.

2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
"This section introduces related approaches from three different research areas at the intersection of which this work is situated, namely, relevance assessment, crowdsourcing and games with a purpose. Document relevance assessments have been playing a central role in IR system design and evaluation since the early Cranfield experiments [42]. Explicit judgements of (the degree of) relevance between a document and a given topic are used as a proxy of user satisfaction. Based on such test collections, the results of retrieval systems can be compared without undergoing numerous iterations of user studies. As a leading actor in IR evaluation and benchmarking, NIST's Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [43] looks back on two decades of assessing document relevance. In order to be",1,ad,True
"suitable for the evaluation of state-of-the-art Web-scale systems, the requirements in terms of size, topical coverage, diversity and recency that the research community imposes on evaluation corpora have been steadily rising. As a consequence, the creation and curation of such resources becomes more expensive. To further ensure the scalability of test collection-based system evaluation, considerable effort has been invested into designing robust performance measures [6], selecting the right documents for evaluation [8] and inferring judgements from user interaction logs [19]. Crowdsourcing represents an alternative means of collecting and annotating large-scale data sets. By employing a large group of individuals, paid at transaction level, tasks of considerable size can be completed in a timely and affordable manner. Document relevance assessments have been shown to be a task that can reliably be fulfilled by crowd workers [4, 22, 15]. One of the fundamental challenges in crowdsourcing is overcoming malicious and sloppy submissions. Many effective schemes exist, ranging from aggregating the results of independent workers to the use of honey pot questions [17, 18, 14]. Marshall et al. discuss the importance of engaging HIT design on result quality [28]. Recently, several scientific workshops have been dedicated to pursuing how to use crowdsourcing effectively and efficiently [10, 26]. Most notably, TREC 2011 for the first time offered a dedicated crowdsourcing track [25] addressing the crowdsourced collection of document relevance assessments. In this work, we adopt the evaluation scheme and data set used there. The majority of crowdsourced tasks are plain surveys, relevance assessments or data collection assignments that require human intelligence but very little creativity or skill. An advance into bringing together the communities of online games and crowdsourcing is being made by the platform Gambit [1], that lets players complete HITs in exchange for virtual currency in their online gaming world. This combination, however, does not change the nature of the actual HIT carried out, beyond the fact that the plain HIT form is embedded into a game environment. Instead, we propose using an actual game to leverage worker judgements. A number of techniques have been designed to make participation in human computation efforts as engaging as possible. Perhaps the most effective technique among these is a genre of serious games called games with a purpose [38] which have been developed with the focus of efficient and entertaining transformation of research data collection into game mechanics. By equating player success in the game with providing quality inputs, the idea is to extract higherquality data than is currently done with dull repetitive tasks such as surveys. More than half a billion people worldwide play online games for at least an hour a day ­ and 183 million in the US alone [29]. The average American, for example, has played 10,000 hours of video games by the age of 21 [31]. Channeling some of this human effort to gather data has shown considerable promise. People engage in these GWAPs for the enjoyment factor, not with the objective of performing work. Successful GWAPs include the ESP Game [37], which solicits meaningful, accurate image labels as the underlying objective; Peekaboom [41], which locates objects within images; Phetch [39], which annotates images with descriptive paragraphs; and Verbosity [40], which collects common-sense facts in order to train reasoning algorithms. The typical research objective of these GWAPs is to have two randomly-selected players individually assign mutually-",1,corpora,True

The Pagehunt game presented players with a web page and asked them to formulate a query that would retrieve the given page in the top ranks on a popular search engine to investigate the findability of web pages [27]. While task-specific games have been shown to be engaging means of harnessing the players' intelligence for a certain research goal, there has not been a formal investigation of the merits of game-based HITs over conventional ones. Additionally, current GWAPs are typically highly tailored towards a certain (often niche) problem at hand and do not lend themselves for application across domains.

3.1 Game Design,0,,False
"The central concept of our proposed game is to require players to relate items to each other. In order to preserve its general applicability, we tried to make as few as possible assumptions about the nature of those items. The game shows n ,"" 4 concept buckets b1 . . . bn at the bottom of the screen. From the top, a single item i slides to the bottom, and has to be directed into one of the buckets by the player. Doing so expresses a relationship between i and bj . Additional information about i can be found in an info box in the top left corner. In the case of document relevance assessments, the concept buckets bj display topic titles, item i is a keyword from a document and the info box displays the context in which the keyword appears in that document. Figure 3.1 shows a screenshot of our game. A live version can be found online1. For each assigned relation between i and bj the player is awarded a number of points. The score in points is based on the degree of agreement with other players. In addition to this scheme, the game shows a tree that grows a leaf for every judgement that consents with the majority decision. A full tree awards bonus points. In this way, we reward continuous attention to the game and the task. As a final element, the game is divided into rounds of 10 judgements each. After each round, the speed with which item i moves is increased, making the task more challenging to create additional motivation for paying close attention. After up to 5 rounds (the player can leave the game at any point in time before that) the game ends and the achieved points as well as the player's position in our highscore leaderboard are shown. Together with the log-in concept, this aims to encourage replaying as people want to advance into the higher ranks of the leaderboard.""",1,ad,True

"Robustness. Does the share of (alleged) cheaters attracted to our game / attracted to conventional HITs differ?

The documents are part of the ClueWeb09 collection [7], and the topics originate from the TREC 2009 Million Query Track [9]. A comprehensive list of all topics and document identifiers are available from the TREC 2011 Crowdsourcing Track home page2. We contrasted the performance and characteristics of our proposed gamified HIT (Section 4.2.2) with those of a traditional one (Section 4.2.1). To attribute for assessment mistakes and personal preference, we collected judgements from at least 3 individual workers per topic/document pair in both settings.

Ratios between 65% and 75% are often considered good rules-of-thumb for the expected agreement of faithful human judges given a relevance assessment task [44]. TREC consensus labels show a high overlap with NIST annotator decisions. The third row in Table 1 shows the performance of direct unaggregated sentence-level votes from our game as described in Equation 1. While agreement with the TREC crowd is already substantial, the overlap with high-quality NIST labels lags behind. As we aggregate across multiple workers' annotations of the same sentence (Equation 2) and, finally, across all sentences extracted from the same document (Equation 3), the performance rises significantly, outperforming all compared methods.

For many use cases in human computation, low latencies are essential. The particular nature of the game imposed a time limit on players within which they had to make their decisions. As we detailed in the previous section, aggregation across users, weighting votes according to the difficulty level under which they were created, ensured competitive result quality. At the same time, however, a sequence of, individually quick, concept matchings enables workers to be more efficient and motivated than in conventional settings. Table 3 shows how conventional HITs take slightly longer to judge documents even when aggregating the duration of all passage-level votes in the game-based setting. Taking into account the significantly higher uptake rate (number of judgements issued per hour) of the game HITs, this serves for a considerably more efficient batch processing. Especially in conjunction with the previous section's findings of high degrees of redundancy serving for better result quality, high uptake rates become crucial as they allow for timely, yet accurate decisions.",1,TREC,True

"The third and final evaluation criterion employed for TREC 2011 was the cost involved in the collection of relevance labels. With our game-based approach, we aim to, at least partially, replace the financial reward of the HIT with entertainment as an alternative motivation. In this section, we will investigate to which degree this change in incentives can be observed in worker behaviour. In order to be paid via the crowdsourcing platform, workers had to complete at least one round (10 concept matchings) of our game. At that point the required confirmation token was displayed to them and they could return to the platform in order to claim their payment. However, the game offered an additional 4 levels to be played. From a purely monetary-driven perspective there would be no reason for continuing to play at that point. As we can see in Table 4, however, over 70% of games are played beyond the first round. This essentially results in crowdsourcing workers creating judgements free of charge because they enjoy the game experience. Additionally, we can observe players to return to the game after a number of hours to play again and improve their score and their resulting position on the leader board. Subsequent visits often happen directly to the game page, without being redirected from (and paid through) the crowdsourcing platform. Almost 80% of all players (633 out of 795) return after their first round played, with an average time gap of 7.4 hours between games. For regular HITs, we observed a return rate of only 23%.",1,TREC,True
"When inspecting the concrete distribution of judgements across workers, as shown in Figure 3, we see this trend continued. Crowdsourcing tasks often tend to exhibit Power-law distributions of work over unique workers with some strong performers and a long tail of casual workers who only submit single HITs. Here, however, we notice a strong center group of medium-frequency players. We hypothesise that replacing the workers' extrinsic motivation (""do the HIT to earn money"") by an intrinsic one (""let's have some fun""), causes these tendencies.",0,,False

"Table 5 shows a final cost comparison of the conventional and game-based versions of the inspected relevance assessment HIT. While all indicators of cost efficiency from a worker's perspective clearly speak for choosing the conventional, better-paying HIT, the previously described figures of HIT uptake rates as well as the high number of alternative HITs available at all times on large-scale platforms such as AMT, indicate, that we reach workers who consider the entertainment potential of a HIT before choosing it. If we consider all judgements made in rounds after the first one and all judgements from revisits that were not paid for on the crowdsourcing platform as free-of-charge judgements, we arrive at a share of 83.7% of all labels having been created free of charge. Additionally, a number of players (39 out of 795) accessed the game without being prompted (and paid) by a crowdsourcing platform. These players were recruited from the authors' professional and private networks or word of mouth of other players. We could not find significant differences in the judgement quality or volume created by this group of players.

"Following Csikszentmihalyi's theory of Flow [12], a state of deep immersion is a good foundation for high performance independent of the concrete task at hand. With our game-based HIT, we aimed to exploit this observation in order to create greater task focus than workers typically achieve on conventional HIT types. The previously shown result quality figures support this hypothesis. As an additional performance indicator, we will measure the workers judgement consistency. Faced with the same passage of text and choice of concepts multiple times, a situationaware worker is expected to display a high degree of intraannotator agreement. In the course of our judgement collection, we showed identical assignments to workers 837 times and observed an intra-annotator agreement of 69.8%. We set up a dedicated crowdsourcing experiment in which a portion of the offered topic / document pairs re-occurred. The HIT was set up following the scheme described in Section 4.2.1. Across 500 redundantly issued assignments, we observed an intra-annotator agreement of only 61.3%, a significantly lower ratio (determined using Wilcoxon signed rank test at  < 0.05) than in the game-based setting.

4.3.5 Robustness,1,Robust,True
"Cheating, spamming and low-quality submissions are wellknown and frequently-observed incidents on commercial crowdsourcing platforms. Previously, we demonstrated convincing result quality of gamified document relevance assessments when labels are aggregated across a sufficiently large number of workers. Since our approach appeals more to the entertainment-seeking rather than money-driven workers, we did not include a dedicated cheat detection scheme as would often be considered necessary in state-of-the-art HITs. However, we realise that the observed cheat rate in an assignment can serve as a surrogate for the confidence and reliability of the overall results. To this end, we measure the observed proportion of cheat submissions to our game as well as to the conventional HIT version. Eickhoff et al. [14] suggest categorizing workers who disagree with the majority decision in more than half of all cases as cheaters. In order to deliver a conservative estimate of the rate of cheat submissions, we tighten their definition and consider a worker as cheating if at least 67% of their submissions disagree with the majority vote. This scheme was applied to both, the conventional HIT as well as the gamified version. In the game-based case, we additionally flagged all submissions as cheat that tried using forged confirmation tokens. Overall, this resulted in a share of 13.5% of the conventional HIT's judgements being considered cheated. For the gamebased version, the percentage was a significantly lower 2.3%.

Table 6 shows an overview of several salient outcomes of the survey. The split in decisions was roughly equal, with 24% of workers not indicating clear preferences. The entertainment-seeking worker is on average several years younger, more likely to hold a university degree and will typically earn a higher salary.

"Many commercial crowdsourcing schemes report performance gains when filtering the crowd by nationality. Due to different expected levels of education, language skills or cultural properties, such steps may influence result quality. As a final dimension of our investigation of games for use on commercial crowdsourcing platforms, we will inspect whether worker origin has an influence on result quality. From our survey, we found Indian workers, with a share of 60%, to be the dominant group in both settings. US workers were consistently the runners-up with a proportion of approximately 25%. There was no significant difference in the likelihood to prefer games over conventional HITs between countries. Finally, when inspecting result quality from our game, again, no difference in performance or likelihood to cheat could be found. This suggests that filtering workers by nationality may not be ideal. In fact, the underlying worker motivation and HIT type preference may be assumed to have a far greater impact on observed uptake, performance and trustworthiness.",0,,False

"In the previous sections, we described and evaluated the performance of the proposed crowdsourcing-powered annotation game for the task of TREC-style document relevance assessments. To demonstrate the generalization potential of the described concept-matching method, we applied the same game in an image classification pilot. In the course of the Fish4Knowledge project (http://www. fish4knowledge.eu/), several underwater cameras have been placed in selected locations in south-east Asian coral reefs. The continuous recordings are supposed to further knowledge about behaviour, frequency and migration patterns of the resident tropical fish species.

"eras is a reliable automatic species classification. In order to train such systems, numerous training examples are required. While the project employs a team of marine biologists, their greater expertise is costly. Using our annotation game, we crowdsource the task of classifying the encountered species. Instead of relating keywords to TREC topics, the objective is now to match a shot of the underwater camera (often low quality) to high-quality examples of resident fish species. By initializing the underlying database with images rather than textual items, no changes to the actual game were necessary. Figure 4 shows a screenshot of this alternative game setting.",1,ad,True
"Our feasibility study encompassed 190 unique underwater camera shots for which known gold standard labels created by the marine biologists existed. Each biologist had classified all images, allowing us to contrast crowd agreement with expert agreement. The HIT was offered in January and February 2012 at the same pay rate (2 US cents per round of 10 associations) as the text-based version. Table 7 shows the results of the experiment in which the degree of agreement with the majority of experts as well as the crowd's inter-annotator agreement are detailed. We can see high agreement with expert labels as well as substantial agreement among workers. The popularity (qualitatively perceived through worker feedback) and uptake rate of this HIT even slightly exceeded those of the game-based one for document relevance assessments. Several workers had mentioned difficulties reading the moving text fragments in the short time available. With images, this does not appear to be an issue. Methods like this could play an essential role either in the creation of training and evaluation data necessary for the assessment of automatic classification quality, or as part of a hybrid human-computer classification in which automatic methods narrow down the range of potential species before human annotators select the most likely species from the pre-selection. It should be noted, however, that the domain experts are by no means obsolete in this setting. While they annotated fish images simply based on their knowledge of the resident species, players of our game only had to select one out of a range of 4 species by similarity.",1,ad,True

"fit of offering alternative incentives besides the pure financial reward. In this section, we discuss a number of observations and insights that were not yet fully covered by the evaluation.",0,,False
"Firstly, considering the fact that the round concept of the game appears to invite workers to create assessments without payment (by playing on after having received the confirmation token), it is not obvious why we should limit the game to a fixed number of rounds. In the present setting, a game inevitably ends after the fifth round. One might argue that a higher number of rounds or even an open-ended concept would result in even greater cost efficiency. In fact, the opposite seems to be the case. In an initial version of the game, there was no upper limit to the number of rounds per game. As a consequence, some players were frustrated, as the only way to ""finish"" the game would be to either lose or give up. This resulted in fewer returning players. Additionally, the quality of annotations resulting from higher rounds was highly arguable as the objective of the game became mainly surviving through as many rounds of fast-dropping items as possible, rather than making sensible assessments. In the new, limited, setting, the clear objective is to do as well as possible in 5 rounds. Players who want to improve their score beyond this point have to return and start a new game.",0,,False
"A second key observation to be made is the fact that while we evaluate against the performance of NIST assessors and TREC participants, the tasks our workers face is a significantly different one. In the game, no worker gets to see full textual documents or is even told that the objective is to determine topical relevance of web resources towards given information needs. We deliberately aimed for such a loose coupling between game and task as we wanted to keep the game experience entertaining without the ""aftertaste"" of working. It is interesting that mere conceptual matching correlates well with actual relevance assessments. Also, in the data pre-processing phase, we do not extract sentences based on query terms but rather focus on pure idf figures as described in Section 3.2. In this way, we manage to capture the general gist of a document without artificially biasing it towards the topic.",1,ad,True
"Finally, the key insight gained from this work was the substantial benefit achieved by offering an alternative incentive to workers. Most of the interesting properties observed in the gamified system, such as workers producing free labels, would not have happened otherwise. This is, however, not necessarily limited to gamified tasks. In this paper we used games as one possible means of showing how a particular incentive (money) can be replaced with another one (entertainment). By doing so, we focus on a certain type of worker, entertainment-seekers, the existence of which we hypothesised based on previous experience with crowdsourcing. We are convinced that a better understanding of worker types and their specific intrinsic motivations is essential in driving the boundaries of current crowdsourcing quality. Kazai et al. [21] proposed an interesting classification of",0,,False
"workers into several categories. In their work, a number of performance-based worker types, including e.g., spammers, sloppy and competent workers are described. We believe, that more general worker models which also encompass aspects such as worker motivation capability and interest in certain HIT types, etc. can be of significant benefit for the field. Very similar to the task of advertisement placement, a worker whose motivations we understand, can be targeted with better-suited precisely-tailored HIT types.",1,ad,True
"The common example of worker filtering by nationality illustrates the practical need for a better understanding of worker motivation. This practice is not only of dubious ethical value, it may additionally address symptoms rather than causes. The original objective of identifying and rejecting such workers that try to game the task and get paid without actually working is often hard to fulfil. Filtering by nationality is straightforward to achieve, but also (at best) only correlated with reliability. This bears the significant risk of artificially thinning the pool of available workers. This work (e.g., Tables 4 and 6), demonstrates that in an entirely unfiltered environment no significant national differences in quality, cheat rates, etc. could be found when focussing on the desired worker type. In this way, we retain a large work force but, by task design, discourage undesired worker types from taking up our work in the first place.",1,ad,True
"Looking out towards future changes to the game based on lessons learned in this work, we aim for including yet another incentive besides entertainment. The leaderboard concept of the current game tries to spark competition between players and has a moderate success at doing so. However, the workers do not know each other. In a reputation-aware environment, such as a social network, this effect can be expected to have a far greater impact. Having the ability to compare scores and to compete in a direct multi-player game with their friends will create much more compelling incentives for (a) performing well in each game, (b) continuing to play, (c) returning for subsequent matches and (d) recommending the game to their circle of friends. We believe that exploiting these aspects by integrating social reputation into crowdsourcing will create many interesting applications.",1,ad,True
7. CONCLUSION,0,,False
"In this work, we demonstrated the benefits of a gamebased approach for collecting relevance assessments, exploiting insights from the field of serious games for application in commercial large-scale crowdsourcing. After a description of key design criteria, we evaluated the proposed scheme following the setup of the TREC 2011 Crowdsourcing Track. We achieve confirm high result quality, matching the performance levels of the best TREC participants for the same task at a fraction of the invested cost, while attracting fewer cheaters. In a dedicated experiment, we showed the generalizability of the proposed game, that, without any changes, was applied for the task of image classification and clustering. In summary, we are convinced that alternative incentives besides the actual financial HIT reward can positively influence the outcome of crowdsourced data collection and annotation campaigns. As a tangible outcome of this work, a large-scale set of relevance judgements towards the T11Crowd subset of Clueweb was created and is available to the research community. Furthermore, the described game",1,TREC,True

This could be done by, e.g., introducing a multiplayer mode in which several players are in direct competition or by integrating the game into an identity and reputation-aware environment such as social networks or virtual worlds. More fundamentally, this work has demonstrated the benefit of addressing the specific preferences of entertainment-seeking workers. In the future, however, we should investigate formal worker models of worker motivation and capability to enable an optimal work distribution and representation for arbitrary worker types.",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"This paper presents the first evaluation framework for Web search query segmentation based directly on IR performance. In the past, segmentation strategies were mainly validated against manual annotations. Our work shows that the goodness of a segmentation algorithm as judged through evaluation against a handful of human annotated segmentations hardly reflects its effectiveness in an IR-based setup. In fact, state-of the-art algorithms are shown to perform as good as, and sometimes even better than human annotations ­ a fact masked by previous validations. The proposed framework also provides us an objective understanding of the gap between the present best and the best possible segmentation algorithm. We draw these conclusions based on an extensive evaluation of six segmentation strategies, including three most recent algorithms, vis-`a-vis segmentations from three human annotators. The evaluation framework also gives insights about which segments should be necessarily detected by an algorithm for achieving the best retrieval results. The meticulously constructed dataset used in our experiments has been made public for use by the research community.",1,ad,True

"singular value decomposition online demo can be broken into singular value decomposition and online demo. All documents containing the individual terms singular, value and decomposition are not necessarily relevant for this query. Rather, one can almost always expect to find the segment singular value decomposition in the relevant documents. In contrast, although online demo is a segment, finding the phrase or some variant of it may not affect the relevance of the document. Hence, the potential of query segmentation goes beyond the detection of multiword named entities. Rather, segmentation leads to a better understanding of the query and is crucial to the search engine for improving Information Retrieval (IR) performance.",1,ad,True
"There is broad consensus in the literature that query segmentation can lead to better retrieval performance [2, 3, 7, 9, 13]. However, most automatic segmentation techniques [3, 4, 7, 9, 13, 15] have so far been evaluated only against a small set of 500 queries segmented by human annotators. Such an approach implicitly assumes that a segmentation technique that scores better against human annotations will also automatically lead to better IR performance. We challenge this approach on multiple counts. First, there has been no systematic study that establishes the quality of human segmentations in the context of IR performance. Second, grammatical structure in queries is not as well-understood as natural language sentences where human annotations have proved useful for training and testing of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. This leads to considerable inter-annotator disagreement when humans segment search queries. Third, good quality human annotations for segmentation can be difficult and expensive to obtain for a large set of test queries. Thus, there is a need for a more direct IR-based evaluation framework for assessing query segmentation algorithms. This is the central motivation of the present work.",1,ad,True
"We propose an IR-based evaluation framework for query segmentation that requires only human relevance judgments (RJs) for query-URL pairs for computing the performance of a segmentation algorithm ­ such relevance judgments are anyway needed for training and testing of any IR engine. A fundamental problem in designing an IR-based evaluation framework for segmentation algorithms is to decouple the effect of segmentation accuracy from the way segmentation is used for IR. This is because a query segmentation algorithm breaks the input query into, typically, a non-overlapping sequence of words (segments), but it does not prescribe how these segments should be used during the retrieval and ranking of the documents for that query. We resolve this problem",0,,False

"We conduct extensive experiments within our framework to understand the performance of several state-of-the-art query segmentation schemes [7, 9, 11] and segmentations by three human annotators. Our experiments reveal several interesting facts such as: (a) Segmentation is actively useful in improving IR performance, even though submitting all segments (detected by an algorithm) in double quotes to the IR engine degrades performance; (b) All segmentation strategies, including human segmentations, are yet to reach the best achievable limits in IR performance; (c) In terms of IR metrics, some of the segmentation algorithms perform as good as the best human annotator and better than the average/worst human annotator; (d) Current match-based metrics for comparing query segmentation against human annotations are only weakly correlated with the IR-based metrics, and cannot be used as a proxy for IR performance; and (e) There is scope for improvement for the matching metrics that compare segmentations against human annotations by differentially penalizing the straddling, splitting and joining of reference segments. In short, the proposed evaluation framework not only provides a formal way to compare segmentation algorithms and estimate their effectiveness in IR, but also helps us to understand the gaps in human annotation-based evaluation. The framework also provides valuable insights regarding the segmentations that can be used for improvement of the algorithms.",1,ad,True

"It is useful to separate the evaluation of segmentation performance, from the question of how to best exploit the segments to retrieve the most relevant documents. From an IR perspective, a natural interpretation of a segment could be that it consists of words that must appear together, in the same order, in documents where the segment is deemed to match [3]. This can be referred to as ordered contiguity matching. While this can be easily enforced in modern IR engines through use of double quotes around segments, we observe that not all segments must be used this way (see [10] for related ideas and experiments in a different context). Some segments may admit more general matching criteria, such as unordered or intruded contiguity (e.g., a segment a b may be allowed to match b a or a c b in the document). The case of unordered intruded matching may be restricted under linguistic dependence assumptions (e.g., a b can match a of b or b in a). Finally, some segments may even play non-matching roles (e.g., when the segment specifies user intent, like how to and where is). Thus, there may be several different ways to exploit the segments discovered by a segmentation algorithm. Even within the same query, different segments may need to be treated differently. For instance, in the query cannot view | word files | windows 7, the first one might be matched using intruded ordered occurrence (cannot properly view), the second segment may be matched under a linguistic dependency model (files in word) and the last one under ordered contiguity.",1,ad,True
"Intruded contiguity and linguistic dependency may be difficult to implement for the broad class of general Web search queries. Identifying how the various segments of a query should be ideally matched in the document is quite a challenging and unsolved research problem. On the other hand, an exhaustive expansion scheme, where every segment is expanded in every possible way, is computationally expensive and might introduce noise. Moreover, current commercial IR engines do not support any syntax to specify linguistic dependence or intruded or unordered occurrence based matching. Hence, in order to keep the evaluation framework in line with the current IR systems, we focus on ordered contiguity matching which is easily implemented through the use of double quotes around segments. However, we note that the philosophy of the framework does not change with increased sophistication in the retrieval system ­ only the expansion sets for the queries have to be appropriately modified.",1,ad,True

"We computed the matching metrics for various segmentation algorithms against HA, HB and HC . According to these metrics, ""Mishra et al. [11] + Wiki"" turns out to be the best algorithm which agrees with the results of IR evaluation. However, the average Kendall-Tau rank correlation coefficient6 between the ranks of the strategies as obtained from the IR metrics (Table 3) and the matching metrics was only 0.75. This indicates that matching metrics are not perfect predictors for IR performance. In fact, we discovered some costly flaws in the relative ranking produced by matching metrics. One such case was rank inversions between Li et al. [9] and PMI-Q. The relevant results are shown in Table 5, which demonstrate that while PMI-Q consistently performs better than Li et al. [9] under IR-based measures, the opposite inference would have been drawn if we had used any of the matching metrics.",1,Wiki,True
"In Bergsma and Wang [3], human annotators were asked to segment queries such that segments matched exactly in the relevant documents. This essentially corresponds to determining the best quoted versions for the query. Thus, it would be interesting to study how traditional matching metrics would perform if the humans actually marked the best quoted versions. In order to evaluate this, we used the matching metrics to compare the segmentation outputs by the algorithms and human annotations against BQVBF . The corresponding results are quoted in Table 4. The results show that matching metrics are very poor indicators of IR performance with respect to the BQVBF . For example, for three out of the five matching metrics, the unsegmented query is ranked the best. This shows that even if human annotators managed to correctly guess the best quoted versions, the matching metrics would fail to estimate the correct relative rankings of the segmentation algorithms with respect to IR performance. This fact is also borne out in the Kendall-Tau rank correlation coefficients reported in Table 6. Another interesting observation from these experiments is that Seg-Acc emerges as the best matching metric with respect to IR performance, although its correlation coefficient is still much below one.",1,ad,True

Nevertheless, for every IR metrics, we observe significant performance benefits for all the human and algorithmic segmentations (except for PMI-W) over the unsegmented query. This indicates that segmentation is indeed helpful for boosting IR performance. Thus, our results validate the prevailing notion and some of the earlier observations [2, 9] that segmentation can help improve IR.",0,,False
"Human segmentations are a good proxy, but not a true gold standard. Our results indicate that human segmentations perform reasonably well in IR metrics. The best of the human annotators beats all the segmentation algorithms, on almost all the metrics. Therefore, evaluation against human annotations can indeed be considered as the second best alternative to an IR-based evaluation (though see below for criticisms of current matching metrics). However, if the objective is to improve IR performance, then human annotations cannot be considered a true gold standard. There are at least three reasons for this:",0,,False
"First, in terms of IR metrics, some of the state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms are performing as well as human segmentations (no statistically significant difference). Thus, further optimization of the matching metrics against human annotations is not going to improve the IR performance of the segmentation algorithms. Thus, evaluation on human annotations might become a limiting factor for the current segmentation algorithms.",0,,False

"Third, IR performance of at least one of the three human annotators (HC ) is worse than some of the algorithms studied.

"the annotators are chosen and guided properly, one cannot guarantee the quality of annotated data for query segmentation. If the queries in the test set have multiple intents, this issue becomes an even bigger concern.",0,,False
"Matching metrics are misleading. As discussed earlier and demonstrated by Tables 4 and 6, the matching metrics provide unreliable ranking of the segmentation algorithms even when applied against a true gold standard, BQVBF , that by definition maximizes IR performance. This counter-intuitive observation can be explained in two ways. Either the matching metrics or the IR metrics (or probably both) are misleading. Given that IR metrics are well-tested and generally assumed to be acceptable, we are forced to conclude that the matching metrics do not really reflect the quality of a segmentation with respect to a gold standard. Indeed, this can be illustrated by a simple example.",1,ad,True
"Example. Let us consider the query the looney toons show cartoon network, whose best quoted version turns out to be ""the looney toons show"" ""cartoon network"". The underlying segmentation that can give rise to this and therefore can be assumed to be the reference is: Ref: the looney toons show | cartoon network The segmentations (1) the looney | toons show | cartoon | network (2) the | looney | toons show cartoon | network are equally bad if one considers the matching metrics of QryAcc, Seg-Prec, Seg-Rec and Seg-F (all values being zero) with respect to the reference segmentation. Seg-Acc values for the two segmentations are 3/5 and 1/5 respectively. However, the BQV for (1) (""the looney"" ""toons show"" cartoon network) fetches better pages than the BQV of (2) (the looney toons show cartoon network). So the segmentation (2) provides no IR benefit over the unsegmented query and hence performs worse than (1) on IR metrics. However, the matching metrics, except for Seg-Acc to some extent, fail to capture this difference between the segmentations.",1,ad,True
"Distribution of multiword segments across queries gives insights about effectiveness of strategy. The limitation of the matching metrics can also be understood from the following analysis of the multiword segments in the queries. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of queries having a specific number of multiword segments (for example, 1 in the legend indicates the proportion of queries having one multiword segment) when segmented according to the various",0,,False
"strategies. We note that for Hagen et al. [7], HB, HA and ""Mishra et al. [11] + Wiki"", almost all of the queries have two multiword segments. For HC , Li et al. [9], PMI-Q and Mishra et al. [11], the proportion of queries that have only one multiword segment increases. Finally, PMI-W has almost negligible queries with a multiword segment. BQVBF is different from all of them and has a majority of queries with one multiword segment. Now given that the first group generally does the best in IR, followed by the second, we can say that out of the two multiword segments marked by these strategies, only one needs to be quoted. PMI-W as well as unsegmented queries are bad because these schemes cannot detect the one crucial multiword segment quoting which improves the performance. Nevertheless, these schemes do well for matching metrics against BQVBF because both have a large number of single word segments. Clearly this is not helpful for IR. Finally, Mishra et al. [11] performs poorly despite being able to identify a multiword segment in most of the cases because it is not identifying the one that is important for IR.",1,Wiki,True
"Hence, the matching metrics are misleading due to two reasons. First, they do not take into account that splitting a useful segment (i.e., a segment which should be quoted to improve IR performance) is less harmful than joining two unrelated segments. Second, matching metrics are, by definition, agnostic to which segments are useful for IR. Therefore, they might unnecessarily penalize a segmentation for not agreeing on the segments which should not be quoted, but are present in the reference human segmentation. While the latter is an inherent problem with any evaluation against manually segmented datasets, the former can be resolved by introducing a new matching metric that differentially penalizes splitting and joining of segments. This is an important and interesting research problem that we would like to address in the future. However, we would like to emphasize here that with the IR system expected to grow in complexity in the future (supporting more flexible matching criteria), the need for an IR-based evaluation like ours' becomes imperative.",1,ad,True
"Based on our new evaluation framework and corresponding experiments, we observe that ""Mishra et al. [11] + Wiki"" has the best performance. Nevertheless, the algorithms are trained and tested on different datasets, and therefore, a comparison amongst the algorithms might not be entirely fair. This is not a drawback of the framework and can be circumvented by appropriately tuning all the algorithms on similar datasets. However, the objective of the current work is not to compare segmentation algorithms; rather, it is to introduce the evaluation framework, gain insights from the experiments and highlight the drawbacks of human segmentation-based evaluation.",1,Wiki,True

"vant to our work. However, 74% of the 50 queries in the 2010 Web track ad hoc task had less than three words. Also, when these 50 queries were segmented using the six algorithms, half of the queries did not have a multiword segment. As discussed earlier, query segmentation is useful but not necessarily for all types of queries. The benefit of segmentation may be observed only when there are multiple multiword segments in the queries. The TREC Million Query Track, last held in 2009, has a much larger set of 40, 000 queries, with a better coverage of longer queries. But since the goal of the track is to test the hypothesis that a test collection built from several incompletely judged topics is a better tool than a collection built using traditional TREC pooling, there are only about 35, 000 query-document relevance judgments for the 40, 000 queries. Such a sparse qrels is not suitable here ­ incomplete assessments, especially for documents near the top ranks, could cause crucial errors in system comparisons. Yet another option could have been to use BWC07 as Qand create the corresponding U and R. However, this query set is known to suffer from several drawbacks [7]. A new dataset for query segmentation7 containing manual segment markups collected through crowdsourcing has been recently made publicly available (after we had completed construction of our set) by Hagen et al. [7], but it lacks query-document relevance judgments. These factors motivated us to create a new dataset suitable for our framework, which has been made publicly available (see Sec. 3.4).",1,ad,True
5.2 Retrieval using Bing,0,,False
"Bing is a large-scale commercial Web search engine that provides an API service. Instead of Lucene, which is too simplistic, we could have used Bing as the IR engine in our framework. However, such a choice suffers from two drawbacks. First, Bing might already be segmenting the query with its own algorithm as a preprocessing step. Second, there is a serious replicability issue. The document pool that Bing uses, i.e. the Web, changes dynamically with documents added and removed from the pool on a regular basis. This makes it difficult to publish a static gold standard dataset with relevance judgments for all appropriate queryURL pairs that the Bing API may retrieve even for the same set of queries. In view of this, the main results were reported in this paper using the Lucene text retrieval system.",1,AP,True
"However, since we used Bing API to construct U and corresponding R, we have the evaluation statistics using the Bing API as well.

Thus, segmentation can play an important role towards improving IR performance of the search engine. We note that the strategy of quoting all the segments is, in fact, detrimental to IR performance. This emphasizes the point that how the segments should be matched in the documents is a very important research challenge. Instead of quoting all the segments, our proposal here is to assume an oracle that will suggest which segments to quote and which are to be left unquoted for the best IR performance. Philosophically, this is a major departure from the previous ideas of using quoted segments, because re-issuing a query by quoting all the segments implies segmentation as a way to generate a fully quoted version of the query (all segments in double quotes). This definition severely limits the scope of segmentation, which ideally should be thought of as a step forward better query understanding.",1,Wiki,True
5.3 Inter-annotator agreement,0,,False
"Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) is an important indicator for reliability of manually created data. Table 8 reports the pairwise IAA statistics for HA, HB and HC . Since there are no universally accepted metrics for IAA, we report the values of the five matching metrics when one of the annotations (say HA) is assumed to be the reference and the remaining pair (HB and HC ) is evaluated against it (average reported). As is evident from the table, the values of all the metrics, except for Seg-Acc, is less than 0.78 (similar values reported in [13]), which indicates a rather low IAA. The value for Seg-Acc is close to 0.9, which to the contrary, indicates reasonably high IAA (as in [13]). The last row of Table 8 reports the IAA for the three sets of relevance judgments (therefore, the actual pairs for this column are different from that of the other rows). The agreement in this case is quite high.",0,,False
"There might be several reasons for low IAA for segmentation, such as lack of proper guidelines and/or an inherent inability of human annotators to mark the correct segments of a query. Low IAA raises serious doubts about the reliability of human annotations for query segmentation. On the other hand, high IAA for relevance judgments naturally makes these annotations much more reliable for any evaluation, and strengthens the case for our IR-based evaluation framework which only relies on relevance judgments.

The high IAA might be due to the unambiguous nature of the queries.",0,,False

6.1 Evaluation on manual annotations,0,,False
"Despite the diversity in approaches to the task, till date there has been only one standard approach for evaluation of query segmentation algorithms, which is to compare the machine output against a set of queries segmented by humans [3, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]. The basic assumption underlying this evaluation scheme is that humans are capable of segmenting a query in a ""correct"" or ""the best possible"" way, which, if exploited appropriately, will result in maximum benefits in IR performance. This is probably motivated by the extensive use of human judgments and annotations as the gold standard in the field of NLP (e.g., parts-ofspeech labeling, phrase boundary identification, etc.). However, this idea has several shortcomings, as pointed out in Sec. 4.3. Among those who validate query segmentation against human-labeled data, most [3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 15] report accuracies on BWC07 [3]. The popularity of the BWC07 dataset is partly because it was one of the first human annotated datasets created for query segmentation, and partly because it is the only publicly available dataset of its kind. While BWC07 has provided a common benchmark for comparing various query segmentation algorithms, there are several limitations of this specific dataset. BWC07 only contains noun phrase queries and there is a non-trivial amount of noise in the annotations. See [7] for a detailed criticism of this dataset.",0,,False
6.2 IR-based evaluation,0,,False
"There has been only a handful of studies that explore some initial ideas about IR-based evaluation [2, 7, 9] for query segmentation. Bendersky et al. [2] were the first to study the effects of segmentation from an IR perspective. They wanted to see if retrieval quality could be improved by incorporating knowledge of query chunks into an MRF-based retrieval system [10]. Their experiments on different TREC collections using popular IR metrics like MAP indicate that query segmentation can indeed boost IR performance. Li et al. [9] examined the usefulness of query segmentation when built into language models for retrieval, in a Web search setting. However, none of these studies propose an objective IR-based evaluation framework for query segmentation. Their scope is limited to the demonstration of one particular strategy for exploiting segmentations for improving IR, instead of evaluating and comparing a set of algorithms.",1,corpora,True
"As an excursus to their main work, Hagen et al. [7] examined if submitting fully quoted queries (generated from algorithm outputs) results in fetching better pages by the search engines. They study the top fifty retrieved documents when the following versions of the queries ­ unsegmented, manually quoted, quoted by the technique in Bergsma and Wang [3], and by their own method ­ are submitted to Bing. Assuming the pages retrieved by manual quotation as relevant, it was observed that the technique in Bergsma and Wang [3] achieves the highest average recall. However, the authors also state that such an assumption need not hold good in reality and emphasized the need for an in-depth retrieval-based evaluation.",0,,False
"We would like to emphasize here that the aim of a segmentation technique is not to come up with the best quoted version of a query. While some past works have explicitly or implicitly assumed this definition, there are also other works that view segmentation as a purely structural analysis of a query that identifies chunks or sequences of words that are semantically connected as a unit [9, 11]. By quoting all the segments we would be penalizing the latter philosophy of segmentation, which is a more productive and practically useful view.",0,,False
"There have been a few studies on detection of noun phrases from queries [5, 16]. This task is similar to query segmentation in the sense that the phrase can be considered as a single unit in the query. Zhang et al. [16] has shown that such phrase detection schemes can actually help in retrieval, and therefore, is along the lines of the philosophy of the present evaluation framework. Nevertheless, as far as we know, this is the first time that a formal conceptual framework for an IR-based evaluation of query segmentation has been proposed. Our study, also for the first time, compares the effectiveness of human segmentation and related matching metrics to an IR-based evaluation.",0,,False
7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK,0,,False
"End-user of query segmentation is the retrieval engine; hence, it is essential that any segmentation algorithm should be evaluated in an IR-based framework. In this research, we overcome several conceptual challenges to design and implement the first such scheme of evaluation for query segmentation. Using a carefully selected query test set and a group of segmentation strategies, we show that it is possible to have a fair comparison of the relative goodness of each strategy as measured by standard IR metrics. The proposed framework uses resources which are essential for any IR system evaluation, and hence does not require any special input. Our entire dataset ­ complete with queries, segmentation outputs and relevance judgments ­ has also been made publicly available to facilitate further research by the community.",1,ad,True
"Moreover, we gain several useful and non-intuitive insights from the evaluation experiments. Most importantly, we show that human notions of query segments may not be the best for maximizing retrieval performance, and treating them as the gold standard limits the scope for improvement for an algorithm. Also, the matching metrics extensively used till date for comparing against gold standard segmentations can often be misleading. We would like to emphasize that in the future, the focus of IR will mostly shift to tail queries. In such a scenario, an IR-based evaluation scheme gains relevance because validation against a fixed set of gold",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"We explore the notion, put forward by Cormack & Lynam and Robertson, that we should consider a document collection used for Cranfield-style experiments as a sample from some larger population of documents. In this view, any pertopic metric (such as average precision) should be regarded as an estimate of that metric's true value for that topic in the full population, and therefore as carrying its own per-topic variance or estimate precision or noise. As in the two mentioned papers, we explore this notion by simulating other samples from the same large population. We investigate different ways of performing this simulation. One use of this analysis is to refine the notion of statistical significance of a difference between two systems (in most such analyses, each per-topic measurement is treated as equally precise). We propose a mixed-effects model method to measure significance, and compare it experimentally with the traditional t-test.",1,ad,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"In two recent papers, by Cormack and Lynam [3] and Robertson [9], it has been suggested that in Cranfield-style test-collection-based IR evaluations, we should in general consider the document collection used as a sample from a population (in addition to considering the set of topics or queries thus). Such a view suggests (among other things) that each per-topic measurement (such as of Average Precision) should be considered as carrying its own statistical precision, or noise, and that this noise might be different for every topic. This potentially complicates the issue of establishing statistical significance in IR tests. Looked at in a",1,ad,True

"more global way, the set of measurements that we take in a test, averaged over a set of topics, are the result not of a simple sampling of queries/topics, but of the interaction between a sampling of queries/topics and a separate sampling of documents. In [3] this question was investigated in an empirical way, via bootstrap experiments on experimental results; [9] was concerned with more theoretical issues involving the nature of IR evaluation metrics, and appealed only to very limited simulation experiments based on simple models. In some sense the present paper takes a position between these two, with experiments based on a variety of models starting from bootstrapping from empirical results.",0,,False
"The primary question being investigated in this paper is the question of how we should think about the reliability of individual per-topic measurements. The question is tricky, and the paper does not arrive at any firm conclusions. However, it is hoped to shed some light on the question. Specifically, we consider tests of statistical significance for differences between systems. An approach that can make use of per-topic noise is the mixed-effects models. We propose and investigate a linear mixed-effects models approach to significance.",0,,False
2. BACKGROUND,0,,False
2.1 Cormack & Lynam,0,,False
"In this paper [3], a TREC collection of documents was split randomly into two parts. For each topic, the evaluation result (in the form of the value of a metric M such as average precision, AP ) in first half of the collection was taken as predicting the value of M in the second half. In order to estimate the variance (or statistical precision) associated with this prediction, the authors took repeated bootstrap samples from the first half of the collection, and re-measured M on each sample. The distribution of M values over samples (single topic, single original set of results) provides an indication of the statistical precision required. They concluded that this procedure does indeed adequately model the variance inherent in an AP estimate for an individual topic in a document collection of a certain size, regarded as a sample from an infinite collection of potential documents (so that the split collection is seen as two independent samples from this population).",1,TREC,True
"Certain technical issues arise: first, it is better to use M , logit(AP ) rather than M ,"" AP , as it has better distributional properties; second, in the bootstrap sampling it is necessary to treat very small values of R, the total number""",1,AP,True
891,0,,False
"of relevant documents in the observed collection, in special ways. These are discussed further below.",0,,False
2.2 Robertson,0,,False
"In this paper [9], different metrics M are investigated theoretically, with a view to establishing whether it makes sense to pose the infinite-document-population question in terms of each metric. Some metrics turn out not to be understandable in these terms; a metric as defined on a given finite population may not be generalisable to an infinite population. In particular, for example, there appears to be no equivalent to NDCG defined on an infinite population. AP , however, can be so generalised.",1,AP,True
"Even if it is generalisable, we should ask the question: is the metric value observed on the given finite population a good estimate of its `true' value in the infinite population? Some limited simulation experiments, using some previously proposed models of score distributions for relevant and nonrelevant documents, are made in order to investigate this question. It appears from both theoretical arguments and these simulation experiments that some such metrics may provide biased estimates of their true population values. AP seems to be one of these: AP observed on a given finite document population is likely to be an over-estimate of `true' AP on the infinite population of which the observed finite population is a sample. The reason postulated for the bias in AP is as follows. The infinite population equivalent is defined as a particular form of integral over (area under) the infinite-population recall-precision curve, which we expect to be smooth. However, in estimating it for an observed sample, we choose to measure the height of the recall-precision curve only at the points in the ranking where relevant documents occur, i.e. exactly at the peaks of the noisy sample curve.",1,ad,True
2.3 Topics and documents,0,,False
"The usual approach to system evaluation in IR experiments is to choose a metric defined on the results of searching on an individual topic or query, and take an average of this metric over the set of topics, for the system concerned (there are many such metrics in common use, including AP and NDCG). The usual approach to statistical significance is to consider the results for the individual topics as the (indivisible) units of measurement. So suppose, for example, that the measure is RPrec and the significance test is the sign test, the fact that system A performs better than system B by RPrec on topic 1 counts as a definitive result. The significance question arises only at the aggregation-overtopics level (`does system A perform better than system B on significantly more topics?'). We do not ask the question as to whether or in what sense the individual topic 1 result was significant. This approach effectively assumes that the topics were sampled from some population of (possible or actual) topics, but that the document collection is fixed in stone for all time.",1,AP,True
"Stated like this, it must be clear that this (the document collection part) is a rather drastic assumption. In fact it is in part mitigated by the general view in IR research that a result is only good if it works on multiple test collections. But this is a rather crude approach to the problem. It would be good to have a much better understanding of what each individual topic result is telling us, and of how best to draw general conclusions from the topic sample × document sam-",0,,False
ple results that we have. A start in exploring these issues is made in the two papers cited above; the present paper attempts to take this analysis a step further.,1,ad,True
"A basic premise of the approach taken in the two cited papers is that the population of documents looks different from the point of view of each separate topic ­ in particular, with regard to relevance. The simulations in both papers are based on modelling the document population separately for each topic. An alternative approach would be to model the population of documents independently of the topics, and then model the interaction of each topic with that population. Such an approach would be interesting indeed but very hard. It would also have to model the interaction of each system with the population, separately applied to each topic. The big advantage of the per-topic model of the population is that both relevance and system responses (e.g. scores) can be taken as given. Furthermore, it serves to emphasise an important aspect of the document sample view of IR experiments. While the entire document collection is typically very large (from which one might be tempted to conclude that statistical precision issues do not arise), from the point of view of each topic we see a (typically much smaller) sets of relevant or retrieved documents, on which all the measures depend. Precision at cutoff 5, for example, should be seen as a very imprecise measurement (in the statistical sense) for a single topic.",1,ad,True
2.4 Variation between topics,0,,False
"It is well understood in the IR research community that there is a great deal of variation between topics. For example, the analysis of variance in the paper by Banks et al. [1] finds the topic effect to be greater than the system effect (as well as a significant interaction effect). The Robust track at TREC was devoted to investigating hard topics, in the recognition that there are significant numbers of topics that appear to be generally hard for systems to perform well on.",1,Robust,True
"If it is accepted that the document collection should be regarded as sampled in some way from a population, then as indicated above, each per-topic measurement has some builtin error of estimation because the measurement is based on the sample rather than the population. One of the aims of this paper is to get a handle on this estimation error. In particular, we ask the question: does this estimation error vary substantially between topics? If this variation is substantial, should this affect how we analyse test results?",0,,False
2.5 Scores and simulations,0,,False
"The method of simulation used in [3] is based on bootstrap ideas. We start with a given system and topic and the corresponding set of results (documents retrieved and ranked) from a real test collection of documents. Then we model the process of drawing other samples from the notional infinite population of documents by repeated sampling with replacement from these actual documents. The method used in [9] is a parametric approach based on score distributions. On the back of previous work on fitting distributions to the scores of relevant and non-relevant documents respectively, these distributions are then taken as representing the notional population of documents. We can repeatedly sample from the distributions rather than from any specific documents.",0,,False
It is clear that the score-distribution approach implies a smoothing effect which the bootstrap method does not have.,0,,False
892,0,,False
"Modelling the population as consisting only of instances exactly like the ones we have already seen seems to go against at least part of the basic idea of samples and populations ­ that any sample we take consists only of examples. We should in some sense expect the population to include other kinds of examples, not represented directly in the sample we have. On the other hand, the use of score distributions typically involves strong assumptions about the nature of the distributions, and also involves some dependence on the particular scoring methods used by systems. Systems differ greatly not only in the kinds of scores they produce, but also in whether they produce a consistent set of scores at all. For example, some systems may do an implicit AND on the query terms, and then use a scoring function which is defined only within the AND set. Others may rank by rule or on the basis of local comparisons which do not result in an overall score. These facts clearly limit the scope of score-distribution modelling ­ as against the advantage of smoothness.",1,ad,True
"In this paper, accepting the limitations of the score distribution approach, we nevertheless use it to investigate the smoothness issues. That is, we try to characterise how assuming a smoother population might affect what we can infer from the sample. But we look at a range of scoredistribution methods, of which one extreme (no smoothing) corresponds to the Cormack and Lynam bootstrap method. Thus taking the scores of the retrieved real documents as given and performing bootstrap samples on them is equivalent to bootstrapping from the documents themselves1. Then we introduce various levels of smoothing, from minimal Gaussian noise to fully-fledged parametric distribution fitting.",0,,False
An alternative method not pursued in this paper might be to smooth by introducing noise into the documents themselves. Some such methods have been used in the context of query performance prediction [11].,0,,False

A test document collection should be thought of as a sample from some hypothetical universe of possible documents.,0,,False
"As is common in statistical analysis of any experimental results, we assume that the sample that we have is in some way representative of the universe, which we take to be large or infinite. The primary object of statistical analysis is to draw inferences about this universe. This is not to say that the test collection is representative of other real documents in the world, but that such a view is a prerequisite for basic statistical understanding. If we do not know how to draw inferences correctly for this hypothetical universe, then we certainly do not know how to draw inferences about the real world.",0,,False

"The document collection used in the experiments reported here is the one contained in TREC Disk 4 and 5, excluding the Congressional Record sub-collection, together with the 50 topics used for the TREC 8 Ad Hoc track. The system runs used are a new set, similar to that used in [6], consisting of a series of 44 runs on the Terrier system. Four different weighting models were used (BM25, the Hiemstra language model, PL2 and TF*IDF), and eleven different query versions (title, title+description, title+description+narrative, and eight query expansion runs using pseudo relevance feedback, expanding the query by between 4 and 512 terms). This set may be characterised in various ways: (a) all the systems (models) generate fairly traditional forms of scores; (b) all runs use the same initial parsing (including Porter stemming and stopword removal); (c) the collection of runs constitutes a systematic matrix of certain variables (weighting schemes and forms of query); (d) all other system variables are held constant.",1,TREC,True
"In the event, four pairs of runs gave the exact same AP values and thus only one run from each pair was used in the experiments while the other was discarded. Thus the analysis below is based on 40 runs.",1,AP,True
"The primary metric used in this analysis is logit(AP ), where AP is average precision. As indicated above, following [3], the distributional properties of logit(AP ) seem to be better than those of AP ; in particular, because (theoretical) range of logit(AP ) is (-, ), it makes sense to model distributions of repeated logit(AP ) measurements as Gaussian; attempting to do the same with AP measurements results in some logical inconsistencies. In [3], some evidence is presented that such distributions of logit(AP ) measurements are indeed approximately Gaussian. However, it should be noted that this does not resolve the issue raised in [9], that of the bias in estimation from finite samples, which applies to logit(AP ) as well as to AP . The use of logit necessitates some smoothing, to avoid infinities at either end ­ we follow previous practice in using an epsilon correction. However, we note that a new more heavily smoothed version of logit(AP ), yaAP, is proposed in [8]. This has better distributional properties than logit(AP ) itself, and may therefore be a better candidate metric for the work reported here; however, we have not yet rerun the analyses with yaAP.",1,AP,True
"The 44 runs have MAPs ranging from 0.273 to 0.131, with a significant bunching to the top end (31 of the runs have M AP > 0.24). If instead of taking the mean of AP , we take the mean of logit(AP ) and then convert it back to the AP scale by reversing the transformation, we see a different ranking of runs and rather lower `AP ' values, ranging from 0.188 to 0.034 (this is consistent with previous reported results using GMAP).

This is taken as the results from searching a sample from some (assumed large or infinite) population of documents, and we wish to simulate what the search results from other samples from this same large population of documents would look like. Thus we need to infer a model of the whole population of documents and resample from it. We avoid sampling from the entire supposed population of documents (which would be intractable) by sampling separately for the results of each topic. What follows is a brief description of the method, which is similar to that used in [3], except that it separates the sampling of relevant and non-relevant documents/scores, in order to allow various smoothing methods. It involves a number of approximations that deserve more discussion than is possible in the present paper.",0,,False
"Suppose that the size of the original test collection is N , this topic has R known relevant documents, of which r are retrieved in the top 1000 by this system run. For the purposes of the present experiment, we will assume that all samples from the large population of documents are the same size, N . This assumption is not used directly, but is implicit in what follows. We first take a stochastic decision about how many relevant to include in our sample. This theoretically has two steps: deciding how many reldocs should be in the entire sampled collection, and deciding how many should be in the top 1000 retrieved set. The first step can be based on the observed generality of the topic (proportion of the original test collection that is relevant, R/N ), and the second can be based similarly on the proportion of these retrieved by the system (r/R). In practice we combine these two steps, and take a Poisson approximation because R/N at least is assumed to be small. So we take a sample from a Poisson distribution with mean r, to define the number rs of relevant retrieved for this topic in this simulation run. We ignore instances where this number is zero (further discussion below).",0,,False

In this simulation, the scores are in effect labels only; it is therefore more-or-less equivalent to the bootstrap method used in [3]. One difference is in the handling of the zero cases. These turned out to be a problem in [3], because (a) the corpus used (TREC 6) included 5 topics with R < 5, and (b) the corpus was split randomly into two parts for their experiments. In the present corpus, there is one topic for which R ,"" 6, and the next lowest value is 13; furthermore, we do not split the collection.

Tests like the t-test assign the same status (give the same weight) to every individual topic measurement.",0,,False

"of topics is analogous to a meta-analysis of a group of experiments. We proposed an approach to statistical significance testing that takes a step in this direction, using mixed-effects models. For each topic/run pair, we run the simulation 10 times, to obtain 10 values of the metric. In mixed-effects terms, we regard these values as repeated measurements, in the sense that the measurements have been taken at random from a population of possible values (i.e. a population of possible test collections). We are not interested in the differences between these individual values within the groups.",0,,False
"The effect of taking multiple values per topic/run combination is to indicate to the mixed-effects model how reliable or unreliable each topic is in determining the effectiveness of this run. One obvious issue is that these measurements are not real ­ they are the result of simulations. We can appeal to the evidence of Section 6, that they are consistent with the observed results. We need to use the simulations rather than the directly observed results because only here do we have the necessary repetitions.",0,,False
"We compare the (heteroscedastic and homoscedastic) mixedeffects models with the t-test. Since we use simulated data for mixed-effects models, we also use the same data for the t-test: this is performed on the means of the 10 simulated samples for each topic. Again, since this is not the usual way to run a t-test on IR evaluation data, we also run it in the usual way, on the observed results.",0,,False
"In order to measure the power of the test, we follow Sakai [10] in performing all possible pairwise tests, sorting by pvalue, and plotting the number of pairs against the p-values: see Figure 6 for the Gaussian Mixture and Gamma simulation; similar plots are obtained by the other two simulation model (note that in this section we focus on the GMG simulations, which show the most discrepancy from the observed results). All these are 2-sided tests. We see that the all four tests appear to be equally powerful, as indicated by how much of the curve is below a significance threshold such as 0.05. Hence, decomposing and separately modeling the precision of each topic separately does not lead to a change in the power of the test.",1,ad,True
What is more interesting however is to examine the disagreements between the p-values calculated by the different tests that could lead in disagreements between which system,1,ad,True
"pairs each test consider as significantly different in performance. Figure 7 presents the scatter plot of the p-values for the t-test on the means of the simulated measurements, the homoscedastic mixed-effects model and the heteroscedastic mixed-effects model against the t-test over the actual logit AP values (without any simulation). This again uses the evaluation scores over the Gaussian Mixture and Gamma simulation. Each point is a pair of systems under comparison. As it can be seen from the plots, there is a significant disagreement in the p-values computed by the different tests (but note that the visual effect is somewhat exaggerated because of the large number of superimposed points in the lower left). The t-test over the actual logit AP values agrees best with the heteroscedastic model. This is expected since the t-test over the mean of the repeated measurements per topic and the homoscedastic model do not handle correctly the extra source of variability. The points in the areas to the left and the bottom of the dashed lines in the plots of Figure 7 represent system pairs that have been found significantly different by at least one of the contrasted tests. If we focus at the heteroscedastic model vs t-test plot the percentage of disagreement between the two tests with respect to those system pairs that are found significant by at least one of the tests reaches about 20%. Examining the system pairs for which the two tests disagree is of particular interest; however we leave it as future work.",1,AP,True
"We also show contingency tables indicating agreement or otherwise between the tests at the threshold of 0.05 (Table 1). The results over all three simulation methods are summarized in these tables. Similarly to the Figures 6 and 7 we see that all test are comparable regarding their power, while there are certain system pairs for which different tests disagree with each other. Note that there is a disagreement in the results of the t-test on actual values across the three simulating methods; e.g. in the case of BST and KDE 303 comparisons have been found statistically significant according to the t-test, while for the case of GMG 318 are statistically significant. When simulating sampling the corpus there are topics for which the simulations produce the same logitAP value at every iteration. These topics are excluded when comparing two systems since the homoscedastic and heteroscedastic models cannot address zero variance within a topic, even though the t-test is not affected by this. Different simulation methods lead to different sets of zero variance topics and hence the t-test across different simulation methods is run over different topic sets.",1,AP,True

The usual approach in IR evaluation, of regarding each individual topic measurement as an indivisible atom, is not consistent with our use of particular collections of documents. The size of the document collections we use is actually no insulation against statistical issues, since measurements for individual topics typically depend on the small sets of documents judged relevant.",0,,False

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"We propose a mathematical framework for query selection as a mechanism for reducing the cost of constructing information retrieval test collections. In particular, our mathematical formulation explicitly models the uncertainty in the retrieval effectiveness metrics that is introduced by the absence of relevance judgments. Since the optimization problem is computationally intractable, we devise an adaptive query selection algorithm, referred to as Adaptive, that provides an approximate solution. Adaptive selects queries iteratively and assumes that no relevance judgments are available for the query under consideration. Once a query is selected, the associated relevance assessments are acquired and then used to aid the selection of subsequent queries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on two TREC test collections as well as a test collection of an online search engine with 1000 queries. Our experimental results show that the queries chosen by Adaptive produce reliable performance ranking of systems. The ranking is better correlated with the actual systems ranking than the rankings produced by queries that were selected using the considered baseline methods.",1,ad,True

"judgments in order to calculate metrics of retrieval effectiveness. Constructing a test collection incurs a cost which, in the simplest case, is proportional to the number of queries chosen to evaluate the retrieval systems and the number of documents that need to be judged per query. Hence, the cost can be reduced by: (i ) query selection that limits the number of queries for which relevance judgments need to be collected, (ii ) document selection that reduces the number of documents to be judged for each query, and (iii ) a combination of the two.",0,,False
"Much recent work has been devoted to effective and efficient construction of test collections [1, 5], with the primary focus on document selection [4]. In this paper, we explore methods for query selection as a means of dealing with a budget constraint. As Guiver et al. [10] showed, it is possible to reproduce the results of an exhaustive evaluation of systems by using a much reduced set of queries. However, it is still unclear how to select such a subset when relevance judgments are not available for the queries under consideration.",0,,False
"In our approach, we first formulate query selection as an optimization problem, minimizing the error in systems evaluation based on a subset of queries. In contrast to the previous work which is mostly retrospective and assumes that some relevance judgments are available for each query [10, 15, 17], our model is designed to work in practice and does not require relevance judgments for a query that is not yet selected. The mathematical formulation shows that an optimal subset of queries satisfies the following properties: (i ) selected queries have a low correlation with one another, thereby maximizing the information we gain from each, (ii ) selected queries have strong correlation with the remaining queries, as without this correlation there is no predictive capability, and (iii ) the total uncertainty associated with the selected queries is small. Here the correlation between two queries refers to their similarity in evaluating systems.",0,,False
"Since selecting the optimal subset of queries is a computationally intractable problem, we approximate the solution by an iterative query selection process referred to as Adaptive. The Adaptive algorithm starts by selecting the first query at random, assuming no information about relevance judgments. However, once this query is selected, the relevance judgments are acquired and used to assist with the selection of subsequent queries.",0,,False
"Specifically, at each iteration we use previously selected queries and associated relevance judgments to train a classifier that estimates the relevance of documents pooled for each of the unselected queries. Using the output of the clas-",0,,False

"sifier we compute the probability of relevance for the pooled documents and used it to estimate the performance metric, e.g. the average precision, and the corresponding approximation variance which we refer to as uncertainty.",0,,False
We evaluate our method by comparing the ranking of systems based on the subset of queries with the ranking over the full set of queries. We report the results in terms of Kendall- and Pearson correlation coefficients and show that the query subsets chosen by our models are significantly more effective than those selected by the considered baseline methods.,0,,False
"It is known that using query subsets may lead to poor performance when estimating the performance of previously unseen (new) systems [17]. We conduct experiments to investigate how our method generalizes to new systems. We show that the iterative algorithm can be modified to improve generalizability. Additionally, we consider the query selection problem for multiple metrics. In our experiment we show that a query subset selected based on a particular metric may not provide reliable systems evaluation when another metric is used to measure retrieval performance. Thus, we modify our query selection algorithm to select a query subset that leads to reliable evaluations across multiple metrics.",1,ad,True
"In summary, the contributions of this paper are threefold: (i ) we provide a theoretical model for query selection that explicitly models uncertainty in retrieval effectiveness scores, (ii ) we develop Adaptive, an iterative algorithm, that efficiently implements our theoretical model in practice, and (iii ) we modify the iterative algorithm to investigate how the selected query subset generalizes to (a) new unseen systems and (b) changes to the evaluation metric.",0,,False
2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
"The increased size of document corpora and query sets has made the cost of relevance assessments one of the main challenges in creating IR test collections. Spark-Jones and Van Rijsbergen [19] proposed a document pooling technique to select a subset of documents to be judged and the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) adopted this method in most TREC experiments. For example, in the TREC AdHoc task, each participating system adds the top-100 ranked documents per query to the common pool to be judged by human assessors. Documents that are not included in this pool are assumed to be non-relevant. Several alternative approaches to the original pooling method have been suggested in order to judge more relevant documents at the same pool depth, e.g. Zobel [21] and Cormack et al. [7].",1,corpora,True
"On average, NIST assessors judge 2,000 documents per query. This is often sufficient for a reliable evaluation of systems, even for recall-sensitive metrics such as average precision (AP ), and increases the reusability of the TREC test collection for other tasks and new systems. Nevertheless, it still demands a considerable human effort and incurs a significant cost when the test collection contains a large number of queries. As a result, most of the existing TREC test collections contain as few as 50 queries.",1,AP,True
"Using small samples of queries to measure retrieval performance may cause considerable errors in the systems evaluation. Therefore, recent studies have concentrated on the IR evaluation with large set of queries [5]. In order to make relevance assessments feasible, various document selection",0,,False
"methods are suggested [2, 4]. These methods reduce the number of documents that need to be judged per query and are often used in conjunction with evaluation metrics [2, 4, 20] designed for shallow sets of relevance judgments.",0,,False
"Following the trend of online search engines with large number of queries, NIST has recently launched the Million Query track [1]. In 2007, the Million Query track used 1800 queries for evaluation. The track mostly focused on (i ) analyzing the efficiency of document selection methods, and (ii ) the impact that incomplete relevance judgments have on the measurement accuracy.",1,Query,True
"Query selection is a complementary approach to document selection and is used to reduce the cost of creating test collections. Guiver et al. [10] have shown that query subsets vary in their accuracy of predicting the average performance of systems. Their results indicate that some subsets of queries, known as representative subsets, are particularly good predictors of the systems average performance as measured over the full set of queries. Mizzaro and Robertson [15] explored the characteristics of individual queries that were beneficial for systems evaluation. They defined the notion of hubness for queries where a higher hubness score indicates that a query is better than others at distinguishing the systems retrieval effectiveness. Robertson [17] later showed that the query selection based on the hubness scores alone does not necessarily result in a reliable prediction of the systems rankings. The work by Guiver et al. [10] shows that, indeed, representative query sets that are effective in approximating the systems ranking, comprise of queries that range in their individual ability to predict the systems performance.",1,Query,True
"Most studies on query selection are based on retrospective analysis [10, 15, 17] and assume that relevance judgments are available at the time the subset of queries is selected. Typical scenarios involve selecting queries to increase the pool of existing relevance judgments to accommodate evaluation of new systems. For example, Hosseini et al. [14] proposed a query selection approach to enhance the reusability of a test collection. Their focus was on generalizability, i.e. a reliable ranking of systems that did not contribute to the judged pool of documents. They assumed that an initial set of relevance judgments is available for each candidate query, and proposed a budget constrained model to select an optimal subset of queries. The selected queries were then used to expand relevance judgments based on the documents retrieved by new systems. The authors later extended their work [13] by considering a query-document pair selection problem when relevance judgments were to be created iteratively. Yet again, they assumed that the available budget allows for gathering at least a few relevance judgments per each query in the test collection. The authors applied convex optimization with a budget constraint to collect relevance judgments optimally across queries.",0,,False

"Previous research provided valuable insights on framing theoretical models for query selection [13, 14]. It focused on cases where there were judged documents for each query in the pool. The objective was to select a subset of queries to obtain additional relevance judgments for a more robust evaluation. In contrast, we focus on a scenario when no relevance judgments are available until a query is selected. We assume that a large set of queries has been initially compiled to measure the performance of a set of systems. Our goal",1,ad,True

As in previous work [4, 10], we use Kendall- and Pearson coefficient as the correlation metrics. Kendall- penalizes disordering of high-performance and low-performance system pairs equally. However, in practice, distinguishing between best performing systems is often more important. Therefore, in many of our experiments, we also report separately the results for the subsets of best performing systems in terms of the average precision (AP ) and the precision at position 100 (P @100).",1,Query,True
"We run our experiments on both the TREC 2004 Robust track, and the TREC-8 AdHoc track data sets.

The TREC-8 consists of 50 queries, 39 participants with 13 manual runs and 116 automatic runs, and 86,830 relevance judgments. In our experiments, we consider individual runs as different search systems, taking special care when considering runs from the same participant. We also create a Web test collection based on the query logs of a commercial search engine. This dataset comprises 1,000 queries, 50 runs of a learning to rank system trained with different feature sets, and 30,000 relevance judgments. We compare the performance of our query selection against query sets obtained by three baseline methods: random, oracle and iterative query prioritization.",1,TREC,True

Therefore, we estimate the best subset of size 10 < m < (n - 10) by randomly generating 10,000 query subsets from which the best subset is selected.1",0,,False

This assumption is not valid in our experiments. Thus, we consider a modified version of this method that does not rely upon such an assumption and is specialized for the query selection task.

That is, it uses the same classifier (as in our iterative adaptive method) but directly maps the output of the classifier to 0 or 1, when the relevance judgments are binary, and regards them as the predicted absolute relevance values. Therefore there is no calibration of relevance probabilities involved. As such, it does not use the MTC estimators discussed in Section 5 but, instead, relies upon the standard metrics, e.g. AP , to measure the systems performance. Considering IQP in our experiments helps us investigate the effect of incorporating measurement uncertainty into the query selection.",1,ad,True

9. DISCUSSION,0,,False
"Our experiments demonstrated the advantages of the Adaptive query selection method and its variations. Here we consider how they may be practically used to support the query selection and assessment scenarios encountered in the TREC type experiments. In TREC tasks, a set of queries is typically selected in advance and delivered to assessors to collect relevance judgments. This setting ensures that all the assessors are efficiently involved in the construction of relevance judgments, and the full set of judgments is constructed in a reasonable time.",1,ad,True
"We first investigated if we can use Adaptive to collect a subset of queries before constructing any relevance judgments. We considered the use of the query performance predictors, e.g. [9, 18], to construct the performance matrix X^ and iteratively select a subset of queries in the absence of any relevance judgments. Since no relevance judgments are collected, the elements of X^ are fixed throughout the iterations. Once a set of queries are selected, the associated relevance judgments are collected concurrently.",0,,False
We used the pseudo-relevance judgments approach proposed by Soboroff et al. [18] to construct X^ since (i ) it,0,,False
"directly estimates the performance metrics and provides the corresponding variance that is required for our model, and (ii ) it is reported to be among the best available performance predictors [11]. However, experiments with the Robust 2004 test collection showed that the accuracy of the performance prediction was not sufficiently high and, as a result, Adaptive failed to perform statistically better than the random sampling of queries.",1,Robust,True
"We then took a different approach and modified Adaptive query selection to construct relevance judgments for multiple queries at a time. Instead of updating X^ at each iteration, we updated X^ after selecting a sequence of k  1 queries. Once k queries were selected, the associated relevance judgments were constructed and X^ matrix was updated.",1,ad,True
"We evaluated this approach on the Robust 2004 test collection with 249 queries and investigated the effect of size k on the performance of the method. We considered three configurations k ,"" {1, 10, and 50} where the first k queries were randomly sampled. To deal with the sampling variance we repeated the experiments 50 times, every time with a new set of initial queries, and averaged the results across the experiments. For each of the configurations, we calculated Kendall- after selecting 60% of the queries. As the value of k increased the associated Kendall- decreased. However, for k "","" 10 the Kendall- was still statistically larger than the Kendall- obtained for the random sampling of queries. As k rose to 50, the Adaptive method performed no better than Random. These results suggest that for some k we can use our iterative method to collect relevance judgments for multiple queries at a time. However, further experiments will be needed to find the optimal setting for k across the iterations, and its relationship with the total number of queries.""",1,Robust,True
10. CONCLUSION,0,,False
"In this paper we considered the task of selecting a representative set of queries and corresponding relevance judgments to achieve an optimal approximation of the systems performance. We started with the premise that no relevance judgments are available for a query before it is selected for the relevance assessment and that only a limited assessment budget is available. Thus, we provided a mathematical model for query selection that explicitly formulated the uncertainty in the performance scores that was due to the absence of relevance judgments. The mathematical formulation showed that the optimal subset of queries should be the least correlated with each other and maximally correlated with the remaining queries. Furthermore, the total uncertainty associated with the selected queries should be a minimum.",0,,False
"Since the optimization problem was intractable, we proposed the Adaptive algorithm in which queries were iteratively selected and their relevance judgments were obtained after they were added to the query set. The relevance judgments of the selected queries were used to train a classifier to facilitate the selection of subsequent queries.",1,ad,True
"We demonstrated the effectiveness of the Adaptive algorithm using two TREC test collections and a Web test collection of a commercial search engine. For all three test collections, the Adaptive algorithm significantly outperformed the considered baseline methods.",1,TREC,True
"Generally, the query selection methods have been criticized for their lack of generalization to previously unseen systems and multiple evaluation metrics. Our Adaptive al-",0,,False

"gorithm exhibited the same problems. However, we refined the Adaptive algorithm and showed that the selected query subset provides effective evaluations of new systems and can reliably be used with multiple metrics.",0,,False
"One of the main advantages of our query selection model is its extendibility to accommodate different sources of uncertainty in measuring systems performance. In this paper, we focused on the uncertainty of the performance estimator due to lack of relevance judgments for a query. However, other sources of uncertainty could be considered. Recent research is particularly concerned with measuring uncertainty of the systems performance due to (i ) partial relevance judgments [2, 4, 20] and (ii ) errors in the relevance judgments made by human assessors [6, 12]. Our future work will expand the theoretical model to incorporate additional sources of uncertainty and explore more general cost models for constructing test collections.",1,ad,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Collections containing a large number of short documents are becoming increasingly common. As these collections grow in number and size, providing effective retrieval of brief texts presents a significant research problem. We propose a novel approach to improving information retrieval (IR) for short texts based on aggressive document expansion. Starting from the hypothesis that short documents tend to be about a single topic, we submit documents as pseudo-queries and analyze the results to learn about the documents themselves. Document expansion helps in this context because short documents yield little in the way of term frequency information. However, as we show, the proposed technique helps us model not only lexical properties, but also temporal properties of documents. We present experimental results using a corpus of microblog (Twitter) data and a corpus of metadata records from a federated digital library. With respect to established baselines, results of these experiments show that applying our proposed document expansion method yields significant improvements in effectiveness. Specifically, our method improves the lexical representation of documents and the ability to let time influence retrieval.",1,blog,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
Collections of short documents present a host of challenges to information retrieval (IR) systems. The increasing influence of microblogging platforms such as Twitter1 makes this challenge especially timely. Twitter search exists alongside other short-text IR problems such as ranking product reviews and advertisement placement. These short documents join more familiar brief texts such as bibliographic and other metadata records.,1,blog,True
"Faced with a corpus of millions of documents, each of which contains only a few words, traditional IR models run into difficulty. First, the vocabulary mismatch problem becomes especially worrisome. If documents are very brief, the risk of query terms failing to match words observed in relevant documents is large. Second, most IR models rely on some sort of TF-IDF dynamic, with a term's frequency in a document lending evidence to our belief about the document's relevance. In very short documents, most terms occur only once, making simple operations such as language model estimation difficult.",1,ad,True
"However, we can mitigate these problems. We argue that a massive document expansion improves retrieval effectiveness for short texts. The mechanism that we propose for this expansion is simple. Because the documents that we are concerned with are so brief, each one tends to focus on only a single topic. A topically homogenous document is not very different from a query. Thus we propose submitting each document in a corpus as a pseudo-query. We show that analyzing the results obtained from this pseudo-query improves the models that underpin IR.",0,,False
"This paper proposes and tests two types of document expansion. Given a corpus of N documents C ,"" D1 . . . DN and a document of interest D, we augment D's representation in the index by submitting the text of D as a query to a search engine over C. This gives a ranked listed of results R1 . . . Rk. This result set informs two expansions:""",0,,False

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT AND MOTIVATION,0,,False
"The growing quantity of information published in small texts such as Twitter posts argues for a sustained analysis of the treatment of brief documents in IR. While this urgency is new, the need for improved retrieval of short texts is not. For instance, many digital libraries manage repositories of terse metadata records. While these repositories (such as the DCC repository we describe in this paper) are nominally searchable, the brevity of their metadata can frustrate effective IR. Other examples of short-text IR include query-specific advertisement and product review ranking.",1,Twitter,True
"But retrieval from collections of short documents is difficult for several reasons. First, brief documents attenuate one of the primary signals used by modern IR systems­term frequency. Figure 1 can help us understand why this is the case. The figure shows data from two TREC collections (described in detail in Section 5). The TREC 8 data included a corpus of news articles. Tweets2011 is the collection of Twitter data used for the microblog track at TREC 2011. Figure 1 shows the distributions of the log-probabilities of query terms among the first 100 documents retrieved using a simple query likelihood model. That is, the points that comprise the distributions are the maximum likelihood estimates of log P (q|D) for each query term q.",1,TREC,True
"Two problematic facts are clear from Figure 1. First, unlike the longer news documents, tweets lead to a distribution of query term probabilities that is strongly peaked. The majority of tweets that contain a query word only contain it once, and tweets are of similar length.

"The problematic nature of IR on short documents has seen little sustained research (though [22, 27] do treat the topic explicitly).

Familiar operations such as measuring inter-document similarity, scholars have found, is difficult given the brevity of many documents in collections of user-generated content [20].",0,,False
"Though corpora of brief documents are increasingly common, the estimation problems that our proposed expansion methods address are not new. Most similar to our own work are results from research on cluster-based IR. Clusters have been applied to various points in the IR process, including relevance feedback [14, 9], rank fusion [12], and as a separate factor used during document ranking [13]. Clusters are appealing insofar as they afford a level of information about documents that resides at a level higher than intra-document word counts, but below the generalities of the collection at large. For instance, Liu and Croft applied clusters during document language model smoothing [18]. Ramage, Dumais and Leibling address the vocabulary mismatch problem in microblog text using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [23], allowing the LDA model to supplement observed term probabilities in document representation. Other methods of document expansion have also seen sustained work (e.g. [24]), though in contexts different from those that we study here.",1,corpora,True
"The most similar work to ours was given by Tao et al. [26]. In their work, Tao et al. proposed smoothing document language models by analyzing their lexical neighborhoods. That is, the model for document D was smoothed with counts obtained from its k nearest neighbors D1, . . . , Dk, with each document's influence in the smoothed model being proportional to its cosine similarity with D. Like Tao et al. we propose improving the representation D by an analysis of similar documents. However, the approach we outline in Section 4.1 differs from Tao et al. in its basic theoretical orientation, couching the estimation problem in the generative semantics of language modeling. Tao et al. define the neighborhood of a document in geometrical terms, relying on the cosine similarity. With an explicit assumption of normality, they smooth the model of D based on this neighborhood and this metric. On the other hand, we assume that D arises from an unseen model D, much as relevance modeling assumes the influence of an unseen model of relevance. To estimate P (w|D) we combine evidence from other documents, where the influence that some document Dj exerts on the final model is the likelihood that Dj's language model generated D.",0,,False

We hypothesize that this effect arises because, in addition to alleviating the vocabulary mismatch problem, our expansion method yields more data for estimating language models. Expanded queries alleviate vocabulary mismatch and improve estimates of the query model, but expanded documents improve our estimates of the document models.

6.2 The Effect of Temporal Expansion,0,,False
"Of our two data sets only Tweets2011 has a temporal component; the DCC documents lack any measurable chronology. Thus we tested the temporal expansion described in Section 4.2 only on the Twitter data. As a baseline we compared our method against the use of temporal priors introduced by Li and Croft. Effectiveness results for each condition are shown in Table 3. Both the baseline method (TPrior) and our temporal expansion (TExp) gave statistically significant improvements over the non-temporally informed QL baseline. However, the difference in effect between TPrior and TExp are small in Table 3, with both methods scoring nearly identically (the differences between them are not statistically significant).",1,Tweet,True
"Combining lexical and temporal expansion improves effectiveness further. in Table 3 the method using both expansion sources, LTExp, outperforms all other runs. For completeness, we compared LTExp against a run using the LExp condition modified with a temporal prior.

Both the baseline and proposed methods improve aggregate effectiveness on these data. But they appear to do so quite differently, suggesting that they are not interchangeable. The run in Table 3 labeled TBoth uses both temporal priors and temporal expansion.

7. DISCUSSION,0,,False
"In our previous exposition we treated temporal and lexical expansion as two distinct operations. But the same rationale and the same mechanism underpin both operations. In both cases, information gleaned from a document's result set is used to derive new information about that document. The influence of each member of the result set is proportional to P (D|Di). Thus in addition to lexical and temporal expansion, we could apply this operation on arbitrary features of documents. For instance, if each document had geolocation information, we could use the methods presented here to make an expanded location profile. Our main contribution is a way to create, for each document, an empirical distribu-",1,ad,True
918,0,,False
"tion of features of whatever type. Our results suggest that for the feature types explored here (lexical and temporal), these distributions convey useful information for IR.",0,,False
"A notable advantage of the temporal expansion method proposed here is its flexibility with respect to the semantics of a query. For instance, the temporal prior method can account only for ""recency queries"" where the user seeks new information. However, our TExp approach assesses the similarity between the timestamps of documents retrieved by Q and those obtained from the pseudo-query of a document D. If Q retrieves documents clustered around a window of time in the past, TExp will reward documents whose pseudo-queries' results occupy the same window.",1,ad,True
"One issue that we have not addressed in this paper is the transformation of a document into a pseudo-query. In the interest of simplicity, we omitted any transformation other than removal of stopwords to improve retrieval speed. However, our results suggest room for improvement by a more thoughtful approach. In particular, we consider the difference between LExp and LExp on the DCC data evocative on this matter. Interpolation with the original document model helped retrieval to a great extent in this case, a fact emphasized by Figure 3. We suspect that this is due to the length of some DCC documents. Many of these documents are more verbose than, for example, tweets. These results suggest that longer documents do not lead to suitable pseudo-queries without some improvement.",1,ad,True
8. CONCLUSION,0,,False
"We have proposed expanding document representations to improve retrieval effectiveness on corpora of very brief texts. Our contribution starts with the idea that short documents often make productive pseudo-queries. Because brief documents tend to discuss at most one topic, the retrieved set for a document D is informative with respect to making predictions about the relevance of D. We proposed two methods of document expansion based on analysis of document pseudoqueries' result sets. First, we augment the language model of D, obtaining an expanded language model D . Second, we induce a model of the temporal affinity of D by analyzing the temporal profile of D's result set. We find that the likelihood that this density generated the timestamps retrieved by a query Q yields an effective mechanism for letting time inform ranking.",1,corpora,True
In future work we plan to address several issues raised by this study:,1,ad,True
· Self-retrievability and document priors. We hypothesize that the extent to which D is distinguishable from other documents in its result set is an indicator of topical coherence. This intuition could inform a prior over documents.,0,,False
"· Use of longer documents. Though short documents stand to gain significantly from expansion, there is no reason the gains we have seen in this study would not carry over to more standard collections.",0,,False
· Query expansion vs. document expansion. Studying more conventional corpora will help us assess the differences between query and document expansion more thoroughly. We also plan to compare our approach to other document expansion methods such as Berger and Lafferty's translation model [3].,1,Query,True
· Other settings. Short documents arise in many IR applications. Searching for relevant advertisements or product reviews are both domains that we believe could benefit from the approaches outlined here.,1,ad,True
· Other expansion data. In future work we hope to examine the value of expansion methods for information such as geolocation data or user-created content.,0,,False
"· Scalable implementation. An efficient way to store and use document expansion data is crucial for our methods' viability in a production setting. In particular, future work will address the matter of changing documents' expansion data as the collection grows.",1,ad,True
"Despite these unexplored ideas, the results of this study show that document expansion is a compelling method for improving retrieval in corpora of short texts. As people's engagement with social media increases the pervasiveness of abbreviated documents, this problem will grow in importance. Considering short documents as pseudo-queries provides needed traction on this difficult task.",1,corpora,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Traditional probabilistic relevance frameworks for informational retrieval refrain from taking positional information into account, due to the hurdles of developing a sound model while avoiding an explosion in the number of parameters. Nonetheless, the well-known BM25F extension of the successful Okapi ranking function can be seen as an embryonic attempt in that direction. In this paper, we proceed along the same line, defining the notion of virtual region: a virtual region is a part of the document that, like a BM25F-field, can provide a (larger or smaller, depending on a tunable weighting parameter) evidence of relevance of the document; differently from BM25F fields, though, virtual regions are generated implicitly by applying suitable (usually, but not necessarily, positional-aware) operators to the query. This technique fits nicely in the eliteness model behind BM25 and provides a principled explanation to BM25F; it specializes to BM25(F) for some trivial operators, but has a much more general appeal. Our experiments (both on standard collections, such as TREC, and on Web-like repertoires) show that the use of virtual regions is beneficial for retrieval effectiveness.",1,ad,True

Prevalent among those signals, and central to most standard retrieval approaches such as BM25 and language models, is the term frequency (tf) information (i.e., the number of times a term appears in a document). Approaches derived from the probabilistic retrieval model are implemented as a summation of ""weights"" of the query terms that appear in the document, where the weight is essentially a normalized version of term frequency.",0,,False
"Traditional probabilistic relevance frameworks for informational retrieval [30] refrain from taking positional information into account, both because of the hurdles of developing a sound model while avoiding an explosion in the number of parameters and because positional information has been shown (somehow surprisingly) to have little effect on average [34]. Recently, though, it has been proved that considering sequences of terms that form query concepts is beneficial for retrieval [6]. Those extensions build up on the Markov Random Field retrieval model (MRF) and use a linear combination of different concepts and query-term scores in order to derive a final score for a document. Furthermore, the well-known BM25F extension of the successful Okapi ranking function (the latter of which we are aiming on building upon) can be seen as an embryonic attempt in the same direction: the basic idea there is that each document is made of regions (fields) and some fields may provide stronger evidence of relevance than others.",1,ad,True
"In this paper, we proceed along the same line, defining the notion of virtual region: a virtual region is a part of the document that, like a BM25F-field, can provide a different evidence of relevance of the document (the amount of evidence is, like in BM25F, expressed by a weight). Differently from BM25F fields, though, virtual regions are generated implicitly by applying suitable operators to the query: such operators may (and typically will) use positional information.",0,,False
"The techniques we propose can be seen as a two-stage ranking: in the first stage, a number of operators are applied to the incoming query to individuate virtual regions within the document; in the second stage, the regions are ranked much in the same way as with BM25F, using the weights attached to each operator. The idea is that there are ""stricter"" operators, that give a stronger evidence (e.g., ""I want that at least three of the query terms appear in a span of at most ten words""), but are less likely to appear in document, and other that are ""weaker"" (e.g., ""I want at least one of the query terms appearing somewhere"", that is",0,,False

"Abstracting from the positional aspect, we can think of our method as an attempt to understand more deeply the user's intent underlying a query [2], following the increasing interest in extracting features and learning about the query itself. For example, all major search engines are able to detect entities in queries in order to shortcut the user to an appropriate vertical (e.g., for e-commerce or news), to trigger different visualization schemes or simply to help ranking better the results that are being produced. The basic idea is that of being able to pre-process a plain set of query terms that a user submitted to build a model of the query (possibly with the help of contextual information, e.g., about the query session and/or the user's profile). This model might simply contain spelling corrections, term annotations or may exhibit more sophisticated expansions, obtained through gazetteers, synonym dictionaries or query-logs, just to name a few.",0,,False
"In general, we observe that information retrieval is moving from a document-centric to a query/user-centric approach, and modern search engines are investing large amounts of research in building better, more comprehensive query models.

Contribution.,0,,False
"Summing up, this paper aims at proposing an extension of the probabilistic retrieval framework [30] that accounts for the information coming from queries and documents. Our approach can be seen as a principled way of integrating query-document features into a BM25-based model [32], by extending the event space using a number of operators that derive from a query model [7]. For instance, both BM25 and BM25F [33] could be regarded as a special case of the method presented here. The framework operates in a general manner by means of a set of operators that are materialized using query-derived information; each operator determines a (possibly empty) virtual region within the document, that is treated as a (weighted) field; query-term frequencies in each virtual region are used to compute the final score of the document. We shall frame our technique as an extension of BM25(F) and describe how it can be implemented efficiently. Finally, we provide experimental evaluation of our approach showing that the usage of operators outperforms state-ofthe-art ranking that use just matching of query terms and is especially helpful for difficult queries. The software implementing our technique and used for the experiments will be made available at http://mg4j.dsi.unimi.it/.",1,ad,True
2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
Some lines of research attempt at addressing the issue of adding semantic information to documents and queries [22]. The model that we present (which could indeed encode [22],1,ad,True
"as a special case) can be seen as a template for grounding different graphical model instances, in the spirit of Markov Logic Networks [18, 29], even though in this paper we make no attempt to generalize the learning procedure of the probabilities involved in the model, and the inference we perform is restricted to one particular formulation and combination. However, the very structure of our method allows one to extend it to different combinations and aggregation functionals over probability distributions. Robertson et al. [33] introduced BM25F, a variation of BM25 that is able to deal with matches of query terms in different fields of the document, boosting them differently. Our framework stems from the same fundamental notions of BM25F and BM25 (term eliteness, re-weighting of term matches) and it is able to extend/accommodate both.",0,,False
"There are several recent papers that deal with spans of terms in ranking. Svore et al. [35] show that introducing spans of terms as a further feature for machine learning to rank model gives improvements over BM25. Other authors have dealt with the issue of incorporating these spans of terms into the language model framework, the first one being the Markov Random Field (MRF) model of Metzler and Croft [26], extending the language modeling framework for information retrieval [27, 39] to handle term dependencies. Some other approaches [11] compute the aggregated distance of matches and add it to the BM25 score, or define a kernel-like distance [23, 24] that can be successfully used for ranking by plugging it into a language-model divergence between the query and document estimation. One remarkable model close to ours is that of Bendersky et al. [5], who weight different query concepts using a parameterized combination of diverse importance features: those concepts can be single query keyword, phrases matching in the document, or matches of keywords that span a window of a certain size.

"Then, for each matching document, we computed the frequency of the query terms within the virtual region and we determined if the document was relevant or not; the fraction of relevant documents is plotted against term frequency. Figure 1 shows the results of the experiment, and provides two fundamental evidences: first of all, stricter operators (2-grams, for instance) provide for the same term frequency a larger probability of relevance, as expected; secondly, the behavior shows in all cases the well-known phenomenon of saturation -- as the frequency increases, relevance also increases but at a slower and slower pace, giving rise to the typical sigmoid-shaped function.",0,,False

We let d and q denote two actual realizations of D and Q, and r (r) represent the event R , 1 (R ,"" 0, respectively), i.e., the document being relevant (irrelevant, respectively).

"Here, the only features that we need to observe are term frequencies; this is a quite mild assumption and stems from the idea that documents are a single body of text with no structure whatsoever. Some earlier refinements of the probabilistic model, however, already introduced the idea that documents may have some structure. In BM25F [33], for example, a notion of region was introduced: each document is made up of regions, or fields, (e.g., title, body, footnotes etc.) and it is possible to observe term frequencies separately in each region. This extension accounts for the fact that some fields may be more predictive for relevance than others (for example, title will be more predictive than footnotes), and fits well in the eliteness model. The idea is that eliteness of terms is decided beforehand, for every given document, and it is the same across fields; term-frequency, instead, will be again modeled as in standard BM25, although it will be influenced by the length of each field--of course, shorter fields (such as title) are expected to contain more elite terms than longer ones.",1,ad,True

A good approximation can be obtained by using the standard document length as a measure of ""verbosity"" of all the virtual regions it contains.",0,,False

Finally, it is certainly possible to mix the two approaches, having some operators introduced directly by the user and others added automatically by the system.",1,ad,True
5. QUERY CONCEPT SEGMENTATION,0,,False
"Albeit today's search engines offer a limited number of operators (phrasal, proximity etc.) most users tend to stick at introducing plain queries, typically a sequence of few words (about 3.08 on average, according to recent studies [36]). Nonetheless, as observed previously [37], many queries are actually made up by some basic conceptual units, each of them being formed possibly by many words. For example, the query indian summer victor herbert is clearly formed by two conceptual elements (""indian summer"" and ""victor herbert"", the former referring to a meteorological phenomenon, the second to a person); breaking such conceptual units apart, or inverting the order of the words that label them, would produce information loss--of course, many documents will contain both the words ""indian"" and ""summer"" without referring to ""indian summer""; also ""summer indian"" will also probably appear in some document, for example in reference to summer indian food, without any relevance to the concept sought. In some cases, it may be wise to allow for one spurious word to be inserted within a segment (so that, for example, san jose airport can also match the sequence ""San Jose international airport"", or george bush match ""George W. Bush"").",1,ad,True
"Among our goals, we would like the model to accommodate for query term-dependence, or concept-detection, at the query level. For example, if there is evidence that the query san jose aiport consists of two concepts, one referring to a city and the other one denoting a place or an action, we would like the model to be able to weight differently documents that only match one concept from those that match both, taking also into account the distance between the terms making up the concepts. To this end, one of our operators will employ query segmentation, an emerging NLP task that aims at identifying sub-sequences of strings that refer to a single unit or concept [7, 37], as described above. There have been limited attempts to integrate segments into ranking [5, 6, 20] in the context of the language modeling framework [39], but to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a similar attempt is being applied to BM25-like techniques.",0,,False
"In the experimental section, we use both a segmentation operator based on generative language models and Wikipedia (as described in [37]) and a simple operator extracting pgrams of consecutive terms: the latter is of course less precise (because some p-grams do not correspond to concepts), and is given a lower weight -- it serves the purpose of identifying possible word-sequences that for some reason the segmentation algorithm failed to guess. Moreover, for both types of operators we allowed for a variety of amount of spurious words appearing in the segment: this is obtained by introducing different enlargement factors µ (a multiplicative factor determining the maximum allowed ratio between the length of the span found and the length of the segment);",1,Wiki,True
"an enlargement factor µ ,"" 1 corresponds to accepting only exact matches, whereas for example allowing for an enlargement µ "","" 2 corresponds to accepting at most one extra word for every single word in the segments (e.g., if the segment is made up of two words, it is still acceptable if we find them two words apart). Different enlargement factors are used in the experiments, of course assigning larger weights to smaller enlargements.""",1,ad,True

"We tested the usefulness and accuracy of the operators described in Section 4.1 and 5 in a series of experiments. We posit that query segments will only affect to a limited number of queries in the data-set; however the working question is whether combining them has some positive retrieval effect or not. Retrieval performance is optimized iteratively using MAP as a target metric. We sweep one parameter at a time over the allowed parameter range, holding every other parameter fixed, in a similar fashion to the method of Metzler and Croft [26]. Each operator introduces two parameters: a weight wj controlling the relative importance of the operator, and a factor bj determining the impact of termfrequency normalization with respect to the corresponding operator. Different enlargement factors µ (for segments, pgrams and phrasal operators) are reported in separate rows of the table, as well as different values for the number p of consecutive terms that are considered while building pgrams.",1,MAP,True
"We report on MAP and P@10 and check for statistical significance using a one-sided t-test with p < 0.05. The operators are trained on two different Web collections: GOV2, TREC's Terabyte track collection [14, 15, 12], and a subsample of the Web from 2011. The collections are described in Table 1. Training and testing is performed on different topic sets; for TREC topics, we train and test on different years (train on TERA04, test on TERA05/06; train on TERA05, test on TERA04), and for the Web collection we perform 10-fold cross validation across the whole topic set. For the TREC collection, we used the topic title as raw query.",1,MAP,True
"Table 2 presents the results of applying one single operator, combined with BM25 (that is, with the bag-of-words operator). Experiments show that all the operators are able to improve the performance on their own to a reasonable extent. The impact of single operators, specially the segments, is limited. However, it is worth noting that the methods using a single operator that restrict the semantics of the matching (like AND or segments) perform comparably to the best values reported at TREC for early precision (P@20) [14, 15, 12]. Table 3 presents the results of combining segment and p-gram operators with BM25 and BM25F. The different operators have been chosen using various enlargement factors; we further enriched the segment combination with a 2-gram",1,TREC,True

The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether the sigmoid-like term-frequency normalizing function is able to accommodate for different features which stem from the same source of evidence (matches of the query term in the document). Results are significantly better than the baseline and outperform state-of-the-art ranking functions that just use matching of query terms (note we are not adding query-independent evidence, like link information, click-through data, etc.). For instance, the best MAP value for TREC 2004 at TERA04 [14] was 0.2844, the sequential dependence model of the Markov random field for IR peaks at MAP 0.2832 [26] and the two-stage segmentation model of Bendersky et al. had an average MAP of 0.2711 over the 150 topics [5].",1,ad,True
"In order to explore further the usefulness of query segmentation and p-grams for difficult queries, we selected a subsample of 1000 queries taken from Yahoo! Search; the data corpus was a 100GB sub-sample of the Web. The queries had been evaluated by a trained editorial team, with about 130 judged documents per query on average: relevance was assigned on a 4-level scale, from Bad to Excellent; given that we had graded relevance available, we report on NDCG (gain values at the relevance level, from 0 to 4) and MAP. The average query length was 3.14. We report the performance of BM25 and BM25F as baselines. In addition, we selected a sub-sample of 400 queries where the user herself had employed query segments (i.e., phrasal queries), and removed the segmentation information. This experiment was aimed at establishing if a more elaborate query interpretation mechanisms is able to be of help in these cases.",1,Yahoo,True
"Table 4 shows that segmentation and p-grams, when mixed with the operator combination are able to improve the performance of a large number of Web queries. When looking at the differences between the regular and phrasal queries, we observe that gains, even if consistent over the two different sets, are slightly higher in the second group ( 12.3% vs.  7.1% in MAP for p-grams vs. BM25F). This fact indicates that the method is helpful for queries that contain difficult concepts, as they have been expressed by users manually, whereas maintaining the performance of queries in which identifying concepts is not so critical and standard bag-of-word approaches perform as well.",1,MAP,True

7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK,0,,False
"In this paper we proposed a way to extend the probabilistic relevance framework with a notion of virtual region based on the use of operators applied to the query. Our experiments (both on standard collections, such as TREC, and on other Web-like repertoires) show that the use of virtual regions is especially beneficial for hard queries where positional information is actually precious. The method has room for improvements and further study should be undertaken to understand which operators are more useful and under which circumstances. Even if we explored a reasonable number of combinations, we have not made any systematic attempt to develop a method to select the individual best operators; we just limited ourselves to handpick a few--it was out of the scope of this paper to analyze automated operator selection. In contrast, a machine learning approach [3] would derive features for as many operators as possible and try to combine them optimizing a loss function of MAP or NDCG [38]. One might even envisage the adoption of a query-classification tool to decide which operators should be used, based on the presumed nature of the query. In any case, our experiments show the practical usefulness of the non-linear operator score combination for retrieval [33]. As a final remark, it is interesting to observe that most of the studied operators (actually, all of them except for segments) do not employ any source of external information, and still produce a significant performance improvement.",1,TREC,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Typically, every part in most coherent text has some plausible reason for its presence, some function that it performs to the overall semantics of the text. Rhetorical relations, e.g. contrast, cause, explanation, describe how the parts of a text are linked to each other. Knowledge about this socalled discourse structure has been applied successfully to several natural language processing tasks. This work studies the use of rhetorical relations for Information Retrieval (IR): Is there a correlation between certain rhetorical relations and retrieval performance? Can knowledge about a document's rhetorical relations be useful to IR?",0,,False
We present a language model modification that considers rhetorical relations when estimating the relevance of a document to a query. Empirical evaluation of different versions of our model on TREC settings shows that certain rhetorical relations can benefit retrieval effectiveness notably (> 10% in mean average precision over a state-of-the-art baseline).,1,TREC,True

"According to discourse analysis, every part in most coherent text tends to have some plausible reason for its presence, some function that it performs to the overall semantics of the text. Rhetorical relations, e.g. contrast, explanation, condition, are considered critical for text interpretation, because they signal how the parts of a text are linked to each other to form a coherent whole [23].

"There is a large body of research on both descriptive and predictive models of rhetorical structure and discourse analysis in natural language text. For instance, annotation projects have taken significant steps towards developing semantic [12, 18] and discourse [5] annotated corpora. Some of these annotation efforts have already had a computational impact, making it possible to automatically induce semantic roles [15] and to automatically identify rhetorical relations [14], achieving near-human levels of performance on certain tasks [27]. In addition, applications of discourse analysis to automatic language processing tasks such as summarisation or classification (overviewed in section 2) indicate that rhetorical relations can enhance the performance of welltrained natural language processing systems.",1,corpora,True
"Motivated by these advances, this work brings perspectives from discourse analysis into Information Retrieval (IR) with the aim of investigating if and how rhetorical relations can benefit retrieval effectiveness. Is there a correlation between certain rhetorical relations and retrieval performance? Can knowledge about a document's rhetorical relations be useful to IR? For example, consider the rhetorical relations of the text shown in Figure 1 (borrowed from [11]). Should some of the terms in this sentence be given extra weight by an IR system, according to their rhetorical relations? Can some rhetorical relations be considered more informative and hence more useful for IR ranking than others? These questions have been posed before (see discussion in section 2), however to our knowledge this is the first time that a principled integration of rhetorical relations into a probabilistic IR model improves precision by > 10%.",1,ad,True

"Reasoning about query - document relevance using the language modeling formalism [9], we present a model that conditions the probability of relevance between a query and a document on the rhetorical relations occurring in that document. We present an application of this model to an IR re-ranking task, where, given a list of documents initially retrieved for a query, the goal is to improve the ranking of the documents by refining their estimation of relevance to the query. Experimental evaluation of different versions of our model on TREC data and standard settings demonstrates that certain rhetorical relations can be beneficial to retrieval, with notable improvements to retrieval effectiveness (> 10% in mean average precision and other standard TREC evaluation measures over a state-of-the-art baseline).",1,TREC,True
2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
"Discourse analysis and rhetorical structures have been studied in the context of several automatic text processing applications. This has been partly enabled by the availability of discourse parsers - see [11, 14] for up-to-date overviews of discourse parsing technology. Studies of discourse analysis in relation to IR and its broader applications are briefly overviewed below. For a more general overview of discourse analysis approaches, see Wang et al. [33], section 2.",1,ad,True
Sun & Chai [28] investigate the role of discourse processing and its implication on query expansion for a sequence of questions in scenario-based context question answering (QA). They consider a sequence of questions as a mini discourse. An empirical examination of three discourse theoretic models indicates that their discourse-based approach can significantly improve QA performance over a baseline of plain reference resolution.,0,,False
"In a different task, Wang et al. [33] parse Web user forum threads to determine the discourse dependencies between posts in order to improve information access over Web forum archives. They present three different methods for classifying the discourse relationships between posts, which are found to outperform an informed baseline.",1,ad,True
"Heerschop et al. [16] perform document sentiment analysis (partly) based on a document's discourse structure. They hypothesise that by splitting a text into important and less important text spans, and by subsequently making use of this information by weighting the sentiment conveyed by distinct text spans in accordance with their importance, they can improve the performance of a sentiment classifier. A document's discourse structure is obtained by applying rhetorical structure theory on a sentence level. They report a 4.5% improvement in sentiment classification accuracy when considering discourse, in comparison to a nondiscourse based baseline. Similarly to this study, Somasundaran et al. [26] report improvements to opinion polarity classification when using discourse, and Morato et al. [24] report a positive dependence between classification performance and certain discourse variables. An overview of discourse analysis for opinion detection can be found in Zhou et al. [36].",0,,False
"In the area of text compression, Louis et al. [21] study the usefulness of rhetorical relations between sentences for summarisation. They find that most of the significant rhetorical relations are associated to non-discriminative sentences, i.e. sentences that are not important for summarisation. They report that rhetorical relations that may be intuitively perceived as highly salient do not provide strong indicators of",0,,False
"informativeness; instead, the usefulness of rhetorical relations is in providing constraints for navigating through the text's structure. These findings are compatible with the study of Clarke & Lapata [7] into constraining text compression on the basis of rhetorical relations. For a more indepth look into the impact of individual rhetorical relations to summarisation see Teufel & Moens [30].",1,ad,True
"In domain-specific IR, Yu et al. [34] focus on psychiatric document retrieval, which aims to assist users to locate documents relevant to their depressive problems. They propose the use of high-level discourse information extracted from queries and documents, such as negative life events, depressive symptoms and semantic relations between symptoms, to improve the precision of retrieval results. Their discourseaware retrieval model achieves higher precision than the vector space and Okapi models.",0,,False
"Closer to our work, Wang et al. [31] extend an IR ranking model by adding a re-ranking strategy based on document discourse. Specifically, their re-ranking formula consists of the original retrieval status value computed with the BM11 model, which is then multiplied by a function that linearly combines inverse document frequency and term distance for each query term within a discourse unit. They focus on one discourse type only (advantage-disadvantage) which they identify manually in queries, and show that their approach improves retrieval performance for these queries. Our work differs on several points. We use an automatic (not manual) discourse parser to identify rhetorical relations in the documents to be retrieved (not queries). We consider 15 rhetorical relations (not 1) and we study their impact to retrieval performance using a modification of the IR language model.",1,ad,True
"Finally, Suwandaratna & Perera [29] also present a reranking approach for Web search that uses discourse structure. They report a heuristic algorithm for refining search results based on their rhetorical relations. Their implementation and evaluation is partly based on a series of ad-hoc choices, making it hard to compare with other approaches. They report a positive user-based evaluation of their system for ten test cases.",1,ad-hoc,True

6. DISCUSSION,0,,False
6.1 Rhetorical Relation Distribution,0,,False
"The distribution of the 15 rhetorical relations we identified in our dataset is not the same for all rhetorical relations (see Figure 2). Some types, e.g. topic-comment, tend to be very sparse, whereas relations such as elaboration prevail.",0,,False
"This has no impact on the model presented in section 3, but it can bias the optimised inference of the model presented in section 5. The lower the occurrence of a rhetorical relation in the dataset, the fewer the observations of retrieval performance associated with it, and hence the weaker the predictions we can infer about whether it is optimal or not. A fairer setting would be to have the same number of `query - retrieval performance' observations for all rhetorical relations - however that would imply fiddling with the document distribution of our dataset significantly, potentially harming its quality as a test collection.",0,,False
6.2 Limitations,0,,False
"A general limitation of discourse analysis is that not all types of text are susceptible to it. For instance, legal text, contracts, or item lists often lack rhetorical structure. In this work, we made no effort to identify and exempt such types of text from the discourse parsing. We reasoned that, as the SPADE parser includes a first-step grammatical parsing, the initial grammatical parsing of these types of text would flag out ill-formed parts (e.g. missing a verb, or consisting of extremely long sentences), which would then be skipped by the discourse analysis. This was indeed the case, however at a certain efficiency cost. Overall processing speed for SPADE was approximately 19 seconds per document (including the initial grammatical parsing), on a machine of 9 GB RAM, 8 core processor at 2.27GHz. One way of improving this performance would be to update the first-step grammatical parsing. Currently this depends on the well-known Charniak parser [6], which is one of the best performing grammatical parsers, however no longer supported. Other state-of-theart faster grammatical parsers, e.g. the Stanford parser8, could be adapted and plugged into SPADE instead.",1,ad,True
"The choice of applying our model for re-ranking as opposed to ranking all documents was closely related to the efficiency concerns discussed above. Our model is not specific to re-ranking only, however, using SPADE on approximately 50 million documents was too expensive at this point. Improving the discourse parser's efficiency is something we are currently working on, with the aim to apply our model for full ranking and see if the conclusions drawn from this work hold.",0,,False
"Finally, the accuracy of the discourse parser was not considered in this work, apart from indications in the literature that SPADE is a generally well-performing parser [27]. Given that the default version of the parser we used is trained on news articles, one may reason that its accuracy could improve if we train it on the retrieval collection, or on doc-",0,,False

938,0,,False
"uments of the same domain. Note that, parsing accuracy aside, rhetorical relations assignment is not an entirely unambiguous process, even to humans [23]. For the purposes of this work, this type of fine-grained ambiguity may however not be important to retrieval performance.",0,,False
6.3 Future Extensions,0,,False
"Future extensions include primarily making SPADE scalable on large collections of documents as discussed above, as well as using more than one rhetorical relation per document. For instance, the posterior probabilities estimated in section 5.1 could be used to weight the text in each rhetorical relation. If those posteriors are too flat, an exponent could make them peakier. As the exponent goes to infinity, the maximum relation model presented in section 5.2 would be recovered. In addition, we intend to refine the discourse analysis by considering the nucleus (i.e. central) versus satellite (i.e. peripheral) rhetorical relations for IR, as well as to improve the effectiveness of the discourse parser by training it on data of the same domain. As discussed in section 3.2, we will also investigate alternative estimations of Equations 2-3.",1,ad,True
"An interesting future research direction is the potential relation between rhetorical relations and user context: for instance, in a search session including several query reformulations, is there a correlation between the progression of the information need of the user and the rhetorical relations that the retrieval system should boost in a document (e.g. elaboration), as indicated by Sun & Chai [28]? Another interesting future extension of this work is in relation to evaluation measures of graded relevance measures on an inter-document level, as investigated in XML retrieval [20] for instance. If parts of a document can be regarded as more or less relevant, this may be reflected to their discourse structure. This might be especially useful for multi-threaded documents, such as multiple-user reviews and opinions, where the discourse relations tend to shift markedly. Finally, the current operationalisation of our model is simplistic in the sense that the term `rhetorical relation' is coerced into meaning `non-overlapping text fragment' and the actual relation between bits of text is discarded in the process. In future work we could apply fielded XML retrieval models in order to investigate nested structuring among rhetorical relations.",1,ad,True
7. CONCLUSIONS,0,,False
"Rhetorical relations, e.g. contrast, explanation, condition, indicate the different ways in which the parts of a text are linked to each other to form a coherent whole. This work studied two questions: Is there a correlation between certain rhetorical relations and retrieval performance? Can knowledge about a document's rhetorical relations be useful to IR? To address these, we presented a retrieval model that conditions the probability of relevance between a query and a document on the rhetorical relations occurring in that document. We applied that model to an IR re-ranking scenario for Web search. Experimental evaluation of different versions of our model on TREC data and standard settings demonstrated that certain rhetorical relations can be beneficial to retrieval, with >10% improvements to retrieval precision. Furthermore, we showed that these improvements over the baseline can improve significantly, when the optimal rhetorical relation per document is selected for retrieval.",1,ad,True
"Overall, three rhetorical relations were found to benefit",0,,False
"retrieval performance notably and consistently for different evaluation measures and query sets: background, causeresult and topic-comment. In retrospect, this is perhaps not surprising, since these are among the most salient discourse relations on an intuitive basis: the main topic or theme of a text, its background, causes and results [21]. Future extensions and research directions of this work include considering more than one rhetorical relation per document, applying our model for ranking all documents (as opposed to re-ranking only) and experimenting with alternative estimations of its components.",0,,False

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Many of the recent, and more effective, retrieval models have incorporated dependencies between the terms in the query. In this paper, we advance this query representation one step further, and propose a retrieval framework that models higher-order term dependencies, i.e., dependencies between arbitrary query concepts rather than just query terms. In order to model higher-order term dependencies, we represent a query using a hypergraph structure ­ a generalization of a graph, where a (hyper)edge connects an arbitrary subset of vertices. A vertex in a query hypergraph corresponds to an individual query concept, and a dependency between a subset of these vertices is modeled through a hyperedge. An extensive empirical evaluation using both newswire and web corpora demonstrates that query representation using hypergraphs is highly beneficial for verbose natural language queries. For these queries, query hypergraphs significantly improve the retrieval effectiveness of several state-of-the-art models that do not employ higher-order term dependencies.",1,corpora,True

Rather than modeling the dependencies between the individual query terms, our framework models dependencies between arbitrary concepts in the query.",0,,False
"We broadly define a query concept as a syntactic expression that models a dependency between a subset of query terms. Query concepts may model a variety of linguistic phenomena, including n-grams, term proximities, noun phrases, and named entities. Therefore, a dependency between query concepts represents a dependency between term dependencies, i.e., a higher-order term dependency1.",1,ad,True
"To the best of our knowledge, there is little prior work on modeling this type of higher-order term dependencies for information retrieval. Most retrieval models limit their attention to either pairwise term dependencies [11, 26] or, at most, dependencies between multiple terms [2, 27]. In contrast, the retrieval framework proposed in this paper can model dependencies between arbitrary concepts, e.g., a dependency between a phrase and a term. We hypothesize that an accurate modeling of concept dependencies is especially important for verbose natural language queries. This is due to the fact that the grammatical complexity of these queries often challenges the capabilities of the current retrieval models [2, 20].",0,,False

"Figure 1(a) shows an excerpt from the top document retrieved by a sequential dependence model [27], a state-ofthe-art retrieval model that incorporates term dependencies.

"retrieved by our method with respect to the query. Even though this excerpt matches less of the query terms than the excerpt in Figure 1(a), it contains a relationship between the term dog and the phrase ""law enforcement"", which is highly indicative of its relevance. This relationship cannot be modeled without accounting for higher-order term dependencies.",0,,False
"As Figure 1 shows, the evidence of the concepts co-occurring within a passage of text is a strong indicator of their dependency. This is somewhat akin to term dependencies, which are often modeled based on the frequency of the terms cooccurring next (or close) to each other in the document [27, 39, 26].",0,,False
"In the case of concept dependency, however, instead of relying on the entire document, we only examine a single document passage that is deemed to be the most relevant with respect to the query. This focused evidence can distinguish between relevant documents and documents which simply contain many repeated concept instances, as in Figure 1(a). This approach is reminiscent of the passage retrieval models that often make use of the evidence from the highest-scoring document passage [3, 9, 8, 16, 41].",1,ad,True
"In contrast to the approach presented in this work, most passage retrieval methods are based on a conjunctive retrieval model and treat a query as a bag of words. However, as the excerpts in Figure 1 demonstrate, such a simple conjunctive retrieval model is not sufficient, especially for verbose, natural language queries.",0,,False
"Instead, the proposed retrieval framework distinguishes between the concepts and the dependencies that are crucial for conveying the query intent, and the concepts and the dependencies of lesser importance. For instance, in the case of the query in Figure 1, the dependency (dog, ""law enforcement"") in Figure 1(b) is crucial for expressing the query intent, while the dependency (information and ""law enforcement"") in Figure 1(a) is not.",1,ad,True
"To summarize, unlike any of the current retrieval models, the retrieval framework proposed in this paper integrates three main characteristics that we believe are crucial for improving the effectiveness of retrieval with verbose queries. First, it models arbitrary term dependencies as concepts. Second, it uses passage-level evidence to model the dependencies between these concepts. Finally, it assigns weights to both concepts and concept dependencies, proportionate to the estimate of their importance for expressing the query intent. In this paper, we show that by integrating these characteristics, the proposed retrieval framework can significantly improve the effectiveness of several current state-ofthe-art retrieval models.",0,,False

In order to match the document, the individual terms in a concept in the PRstructure may occur in any order within a window of fixed length.

"Finally, note the negative weight assigned to the proximity (PR) structure in the global factor. While small, this negative weight is consistent across folds, as well as in the other collections.

5. CONCLUSIONS,0,,False
"The retrieval framework proposed in this paper represents a query by means of a hypergraph. In the query hypergraph, each vertex corresponds to a concept, and these concepts are grouped into disjoint structures. A hyperedge in the query hypergraph represents a concept dependency. We describe a principled derivation of a ranking function based on the factorization of the query hypergraph. We then propose two parameterization regimes for the derived ranking function, based on either structures or concepts.",0,,False
"The proposed retrieval framework exhibits three important characteristics. First, it models term dependencies as concepts. Second, it models dependencies between these concepts (i.e., higher-order term dependencies). Finally, it assigns weights to concepts and concept dependencies, proportionate to their importance for expressing the query intent. For verbose natural queries, the proposed retrieval framework significantly improves the retrieval effectiveness of several state-of-the-art retrieval methods that do not incorporate higher-order term dependencies.",1,corpora,True

ABSTRACT,0,,False
"Many current effectiveness measures incorporate simplifying assumptions about user behavior. These assumptions prevent the measures from reflecting aspects of the search process that directly impact the quality of retrieval results as experienced by the user. In particular, these measures implicitly model users as working down a list of retrieval results, spending equal time assessing each document. In reality, even a careful user, intending to identify as much relevant material as possible, must spend longer on some documents than on others. Aspects such as document length, duplicates and summaries all influence the time required. In this paper, we introduce a time-biased gain measure, which explicitly accommodates such aspects of the search process. By conducting an appropriate user study, we calibrate and validate the measure against the TREC 2005 Robust Track test collection. We examine properties of the measure, contrasting it to traditional effectiveness measures, and exploring its extension to other aspects and environments. As its primary benefit, the measure allows us to evaluate system performance in human terms, while maintaining the simplicity and repeatability of system-oriented tests. Overall, we aim to achieve a clearer connection between user-oriented studies and system-oriented tests, allowing us to better transfer insights and outcomes from one to the other.",1,corpora,True

1. INTRODUCTION,1,DUC,True
"System-oriented tests and user-oriented studies represent competing approaches to search engine evaluation. A systemoriented test typically develops a set of relevance judgments to determine the quality of ranked document lists returned in response to a query [39]. Effectiveness measures computed over these ranked lists provide a method for tuning search engines and comparing one engine to another. In contrast, a user-oriented study examines actual user behavior during interactive retrieval sessions. These studies span a spectrum from intensive laboratory investigations involving a relatively small number of subjects [18] to large-scale analyses of interaction logs capturing the search activities of millions of people [9, 42, 43].",0,,False
"The value of a user-oriented study lies in its ability to reflect many aspects of the search process, including interaction and presentation. Unfortunately, user studies can be complex and costly. Running subjects through a laboratory experiment can require substantial time and money, and we may need to repeat experiments as elements of the interface and engine change. On the other hand, interaction logs are noisy, uncontrolled, and capture only a portion of the user experience.",0,,False
"The value of a system-oriented test lies in its simplicity and repeatability. Effectiveness measures isolate and evaluate a single element of the search engine, i.e., the quality of its ranked list. Once we develop a set of relevance judgments, evaluation measures can be re-computed with little additional expense or effort. As software developers modify and train ranking algorithms, effectiveness measures may be applied over and over again, as often as needed.",1,ad,True
"Various researchers [7, 10, 43] suggest a generic framework that encapsulates many of the effectiveness measures in current use, including Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) [17], Rank Biased Precision (RBP) [23], and Expected Reciprocal Rank (ERR) [9]. All of these measures can be expressed as a sum over documents in a ranked list,",0,,False

"where gk represents the gain associated with the document appearing at rank k, and dk represents a discount associated with rank k, which is independent of the document. In practice, we either compute the sum to some fixed but arbitrary depth K or until we know its value within some . The normalization factor N is optional, but if it is present, it serves to map the value of the sum into the range [0 : 1], which may be required for averaging over multiple queries.",0,,False
95,0,,False
"RBP uses the discount formula dk ,"" k-1, where  is a constant in the range [0 : 1]. Gain values for RBP are binary, with gk "","" 1 if the document at rank k is judged relevant, and gk "", 0 if it is not judged relevant. ERR uses a reciprocal rank discount formula of dk ,"" 1/k, and nDCG uses the discount formula dk "","" 1/ (log2(1 + k)). For both of these measures, a gain value may be interpreted as a relevance probability, i.e., the probability that a user viewing the document would judge it to be relevant. When applying these measures, the probabilities are estimated from graded relevance judgments, e.g., """"definitive"""", """"excellent"""", """"good"""", etc. [24]. In the case of ERR, the gain value of a document at rank k depends on the gain values of the documents at ranks 1 to k - 1, with gain values increasingly attenuated when more relevant documents appear at higher ranks.""",1,ad,True
"All of these measures may be interpreted in terms of a simple user model: The user starts at the first document and works their way down the list, eventually stopping when they become tired or bored. The discount dk indicates the probability that the user continues to rank k, and the gain gk represents the benefit (i.e., utility) to the user of viewing the document at rank k. Thus, the sum in Equation 1 can be understood as the expected total benefit experienced by the user, with the various gain values and discount formulae corresponding to different assumptions about user needs and behaviors. In particular, the attenuated gain values in ERR correspond to the idea that, after viewing each relevant document, the user derives less benefit from viewing additional relevant documents.",1,ad,True
"Underlying this user model is an implicit assumption that the user views documents at a constant rate, spending the same time assessing each one. Because of this assumption, these effectiveness measures can fail to accommodate aspects of the search process that directly impact the quality of the ranked list as experienced by the user. For example, most modern search engines provide captions, or summaries, that describe each of the documents [36]. A user scanning these summaries might quickly skip those results that are obviously not relevant to their needs, without ever viewing the contents of the associated documents. Similarly, we might expect shorter documents to take less time to assess than longer documents, since a user may spend less time skimming them. In addition, when a document is similar in content to a document a user has already viewed, it may be easy to assess quickly, regardless of its length. Once a user recognizes the duplicated content, they can immediately return to the result list and continue to the next result.",1,ad,True
"In this paper, we propose a framework for evaluation measures based on time, allowing us to directly accommodate aspects of the search process ignored by standard effectiveness measures. We retain the simple model of a user working their way down a result list, but with both gain and discount now expressed in terms of time. As the user works their way down the list, let G(t) be the cumulative gain experienced by the user at time t. In other words, if the user invests time t in assessing the result list, they will derive a total benefit of G(t). We model the possibility that the user stops at some point by a decay function D(t), which indicates the probability that the user continues until time t. Thus, D(0) ,"" 1 and decreases monotonically to 0 as t  . Under this model, an equivalent of Equation 1 may be expressed as""",0,,False

"We refer to Equation 3 as time-biased gain, and we spend the remainder of this paper developing and exploring this effectiveness measure. In its development, we face the potentially controversial and complex problem of providing a realistic estimate for T (k). Ideally, for use in an effectiveness measure, the estimate should be straightforward both to compute and to comprehend. Competing with this requirement is the need for a clear connection back to actual user behavior, so that the effectiveness measure provides a meaningful guide for training and tuning ranking algorithms.",0,,False
"We note that setting T (k) ,"" c(k - 1), for some constant c, reduces Equation 3 back to Equation 1, which corresponds to a scenario in which the user views documents at a constant rate. To move beyond this simple scenario, we need to examine user behavior in a realistic context, calibrating our estimate of T (k) against the actions of these users. As a result, time-biased gain is more closely tied to a usage scenario than traditional evaluation measures. Moving to a different scenario requires a different calibration of the evaluation measure, a price we pay for the closer connection to user behavior.""",1,ad,True
"After a review of related work, we discuss the calibration and validation of time-biased gain against the test collection employed in the TREC 2005 Robust Track experiments [39]. As part of this calibration, we report a user study in which we presented subjects with an interface styled after a modern web search engine, including a result page with ten querybiased summaries, and instructed them to find and save as many relevant documents as possible in the time allowed, while making as few mistakes as possible. The associated scenario is of a careful and determined user, with a topical information need, intending to identify as much relevant material as they can in the time they have available.",1,TREC,True
"We believe this scenario is appropriate for the TREC Robust Track, and similar experiments, where a document is considered relevant if it contains any relevant material at all, and evaluation measures traditionally consider documents that are relatively deep in the result list. For other scenarios, a different calibration might be appropriate. For example, in the context of web search, where users may interact with fewer results and rarely dig as deeply in the result list, calibration might be based on interaction logs taken from the search engine itself.",1,TREC,True
"After developing a T (k) function appropriate to our usage scenario, we consider other components of our time-biased gain measure, including the choice of a decay function. We explore properties of the measure and compare it to other evaluation measures. Finally, we end the paper with a discussion of extensions and future work.",0,,False

2. RELATED WORK,0,,False
"We may interpret many current effectiveness measures in terms of the simple user model outlined in the introduction [7, 9, 17, 23, 43]. While all of these measures implicitly assume that a user progresses down the ranked list at a constant rate, they incorporate different assumptions about when and why the user will stop, and how much benefit or utility they can be expected to gain. All of these measures may be expressed in form of Equation 1 [7, 43]. Even precision at k may be interpreted in terms of a user who always views exactly the top k documents, and no more. Along the same lines, Robertson [26] retrofits a similar user model into the venerable Mean Average Precision (MAP) effectiveness measure, which may also be extended to incorporate graded relevance values similar to those employed by nDCG [15, 27, 30].",1,corpora,True
"Turpin et al. [37], Yilmaz et al. [42], and Dupret [14] have gone beyond this simple model by explicitly incorporating summaries into their user models and thus into their metrics. An important difference between their work and ours is that we explicitly model time in addition to the click decisions. Summaries are designed to, and do speed the rate at which users find relevant documents [20, 36]. We believe it is important that metrics reflect the value of summaries by having a user model that incorporates the time required to separately evaluate summaries and documents. Time is important to users. Su [35] found from interviews with 40 users that the success category of ""Efficiency - Time"" was ranked first with the highest frequency of mention.",1,corpora,True
"Turpin and Hersh [38] hypothesized that the time to read documents was a reason why batch-style and user evaluations produce different results. In their study, Turpin and Hersh found that the baseline system, which had a lower MAP, ranked shorter documents higher than the improved system. The improved system had a pivoted length normalization [31] component that preferred longer documents -- longer TREC documents have a higher prior probability of being relevant. Turpin and Hersh found that users of the baseline system were able to read more documents than the users of the improved system. As a result, users of the baseline system were able to compensate for its lower precision and find equal amounts of relevant material in the same amount of time. Our time-biased gain metric explicitly takes document length into consideration, for we have also found that users take longer to judge longer documents. Yang and Lad [41] and Arvola et al. [2] also consider the cost of reading in the evaluation of IR systems.",1,ad,True
"Our time-biased gain metric aligns well with Fuhr's probability ranking principle for interactive IR [16]. Fuhr carefully outlines that users of interactive IR systems have to make a series of decisions and that these decisions each have their own cost. For our metric, cost is measured in time, and both cost and gain are directly tied to the series of probabilistic decisions made by the user.",1,ad,True
"Much of this work can be viewed as following a framework for evaluation laid out by Cooper [11, 12] and Dunlop [13]. Cooper believed that effectiveness measures should be based on the utility a user personally gains from a retrieval system. A critical part of Cooper's plan was the use of validation experiments to measure the ability of an evaluation measure to predict utility. Dunlop built on and refined the ideas of Cooper. Rather than subjectively measure a user's utility, Dunlop established the use of HCI methods to predict user",0,,False

"Efforts to relate evaluation measures to models of user behavior can be seen as an attempt to bridge the gap between system-oriented tests and user-oriented studies. In these cases, the goal is to move system-oriented measures closer to user-oriented studies. Working from the other direction, efforts have been made to simulate the use of interactive retrieval systems in order to determine their quality [1, 4, 21, 40]. Efforts related to this approach includes the use of simulation to better understand interactive retrieval behavior [3, 19]. We see these two directions of research merging as system-oriented measures continue to increase the resolution of their user models [8].",1,ad,True

"At the core of our new metric, time-biased gain, is the computation of the time to reach rank k of a ranked list, which we will refer to as the function T (k). Given that we are retaining the traditional model of a user working down a ranked list in order, we need to estimate the amount of time it takes to process a given document. As such, we need to consider what is a reasonable process that a user would go through to determine if a document is relevant.",1,ad,True
The majority of search interfaces now present a ranked list in two parts. The first part is the display of a series of document summaries that are intended to help the user decide if the corresponding full documents should be viewed or skipped. The second part is the full document itself.,0,,False
"Faced with this interface, the user must first examine the document summary and decide whether to click and view the full document or not. While it is certainly possible that a user may realize benefit from viewing the summary alone, we believe that for TREC-style topics and information needs, that a user needs to view the full document in order to realize gain from finding relevant material in the document.",1,TREC,True
"Thus, we need to model the decision of whether to click or not and produce both an estimate of the time the decision takes to be made as well as an estimate of what the decision will be. If the user decides to click on a summary, then the user must study the document and make a decision about the document's relevance. Only if the user clicks on a relevant document's summary and then decides the document is relevant will the user realize any gain. Gain cannot be obtained from non-relevant documents nor from skipped relevant documents. As with the summary, we need to estimate time spent on the full document and the final relevance decision of the user.",1,ad,True
"There are nearly endless variables that could be taken into consideration in the models of decision making for summaries and documents. In this paper, we choose to focus on a few variables that are most likely to affect user decisions.",0,,False
"The most obvious variables affecting these decisions are the user and the topic. While users vary greatly and contribute large amounts of variance to user studies, we do not attempt to model different user strategies for processing ranked lists. Instead, our user model is an idealized individual representing the population as a whole. As for the topic, at this time we do not see an easy way to identify a priori how a topic will affect users' behavior, and we are forced to treat all topics the same.",1,ad,True

tributes of the document to use in our model: the relevance of the document and the document's length. Relevance should be a strong indicator of how likely summaries will be clicked and whether or not the document will be recognized by users to be relevant [37]. The time to make decisions based on textual items is likely to be dependent on their length.,0,,False
"Given that summaries tend to be short and of nearly equal length, we will assume they are all assessed in the same amount time, TS seconds. For documents, let TD(l) ,"" al+b, be the time in seconds to assess a document of length l, where l is measured in words. TD(l) models an evaluation process of scanning the document at a rate of a seconds per word and then a constant amount of time, b seconds, to account for carefully assessing a small amount of text and the overhead of making a decision about relevance. As we will justify, if a user views a duplicate of a document later, then we treat that duplicate as if it had zero length (l "", 0).",1,TD,True
"We use a document's relevance to predict the probability that a summary will be clicked and to predict the probability that when viewed, a full document is recognized as relevant.

Also, let P (S|R) be the probability of saving a viewed document as relevant given NIST relevance, where S and R are binary random variables.

"In this section, we provide a brief comparison between time-biased gain and other effectiveness measures used at TREC and elsewhere. Apart from time-biased gain, these measures are computed by the standard TREC evaluation program (trec_eval). All measures are computed over the runs submitted to the TREC 2005 Robust Track.",1,TREC,True
"Figure 6 presents a scatter plot of MAP vs. time-biased gain. The measures are correlated, with a Kendall's  of 0.794. Due to exponential decay, time-biased gain tends to emphasize early gain, a point illustrated by the run uic0501. Reflecting the behavior seen in Figure 4, it achieves the second-best performance, a time-biased gain value of 5.39 vs. a MAP value of 0.310, outperforming runs with higher MAP values.",1,MAP,True
"With the best time-biased gain value of 5.43, and a MAP value of only 0.262, the run sab05ror1 forms an interesting case study [6]. This run was trained on TREC vol. 4 & 5 qrels and documents and had very mixed performance across topics as measured by average precision. While the attempt appeared to fail when measured by MAP, the run's status as an obvious outlier suggests that the attempt may have succeeded after all (or at least warrants further investigation).",1,MAP,True
"Sakai [29] proposes discriminative power as one method for assessing the behavior of effectiveness measures. While high discriminative power does not necessarily indicate a good measure, low discriminative power would raise questions about the measure. To calculate discriminative power, we compute a significance test between each pair of runs submitted to an experimental task, such as the TREC Robust Track. Discriminative power is the number of pairs that are significant at some fixed level. Table 2 compares the discriminative power of time-biased gain against several standard measures. MAP is known to have high discriminative power, due to the depth at which relevant document can influence its value. However, time-biased gain provides good",1,TREC,True

7. CONCLUDING DISCUSSION,0,,False
"Equation 2 lies at the heart of our work. The remainder of the paper represents only one possible route for developing this equation. In following this route, we have adhered as closely as possible to the typical assumptions underlying a TREC task. We adopt the scenario of a careful and determined user, with a topical information need, intending to identify as much relevant material as they can in the time they have available. In another context, such as web search, another scenario will be more appropriate, requiring different calibration of the measure.",1,ad,True
"In following this route, we have also adhered as closely as possible to the typical assumptions underlying the creation of evaluation measures. Similar to the generic framework of Equation 1, time-biased gain is structured as a normalized sum over discounted gain values. Our primary innovation is to discount by time instead of rank.",1,ad,True
"However, a better numeric approximation to Equation 2 might be achieved through simulation. The user model described in Section 3 could easily be adapted for this purpose. By simulating thousands of users interacting with a result list, we may approximate both expected gain and variance. We leave this idea for future work.",1,ad,True
"Time-based calibration allows us to accommodate aspects of the search process that are ignored by traditional effectiveness measures. For example, in TREC collections longer documents are more likely to be relevant than shorter documents [31]. During the early years of TREC, considerable effort was made to adjust ranking functions according to document length [28, 31]. In light of the greater time required to judge longer documents, it may be that adjustment of the evaluation measures was also required.",1,ad,True
"We recognize that our approach to duplicates rewards behavior that might be viewed as undesirable by many users. Since we are following typical TREC guidelines for relevance, our calibration of time-biased gain rewards a system for returning duplicate documents, since they are faster to assess. In other contexts, it is likely that duplicates should provide no gain, thus penalizing runs through the extra time required to assess them. We considered following this approach in this paper, but decided to stay as true as possible to the TREC guidelines.",1,TREC,True
"In this paper we focused on the population level behavior of determined, informational searchers. In future work, it would be good to study different classes of user behavior, and produce for each class a calibrated time-biased gain.",0,,False
